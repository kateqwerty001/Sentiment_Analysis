"I must be nuts to have been talked into going to Disney Paris after going to Disneyland two years ago .. same result ..Over priced everything , 60 minute wait for a two minute ride.. used to be 2.5 minutes .. now 2 minutes.If you are well organized with four adults and two small kids you might get in .. a lunch , and maybe three rides before everyone falls in a heap and melts down .Food is typical carbo , fried overpriced crap.. and we got two days worth!!The good news... cleaner and better maintained than Disneyland, California.Smaller and much easier to get on and off campus.. metro right to the front gate.They do the same princess and pirate show all day every 1 2 hour.. it get annoying because people pack the streets and you can   t easily get past them if you have seen it and don   t want that insanity anymore.Staff are very well trained and speak English for us heathens that are so terrible at French.I can   t believe I am spending my two days in France here instead of downtown Paris.. where culturally the kids would learn so much!",-1
Went here in January for a day trip with my friend. We love theme parks and last year had done all USA Disney parks so wanted to add Paris to our ever growing list of parks. We had high hopes of this being as magical and overwhelming as other Disney parks.... God was we wrong yes it has the rides and has the castle but it just has no magic. Unhelpful and moody cast members. Areas where run down and incredibly tatty. Food was so basic and soo over priced I mean    16 for a basic small burger and soggy chips... Again magic people where is it. Also you policy on disabled people is different to USA this should have been informed to us as it wasn't and    20 to park in a car park that we are only there because we are paying to visit your park........ I can imagine is Walt Disney was around now he would be incredibly disappointed and ashamed of how his name is being used at this park.Fireworks where ok. But again lacked the size and imagination I would expect of a Disney park. ,-1
"Let me start off by saying I love Disney parks in the US. This one is nothing like those. I didn't expect too much but it even fell below that. First, I'm a part of DVC (Disney Vacation Club) and we had to wait way beyond when we told that Disney Paris should have their inventory in. When they finally submitted their inventory we couldn't reserve for April. That is ridiculous. We had to book a Disney friendly hotel. They're about 5 of them. The shuttle service stinks. They have only one shuttle servicing all those hotels. It would get so crowded at the stop that people were pushing and shoving to get on when the shuttle actually came.Second the parks are small and unimpressive. If you love Disneyworld don't go here. You'll spend most of your time on lines. They have the older version of fast pass so tickets run out quickly. I bought photospass  and guess what, there are no disney photographers in the park. Except at the character lines. Not all rides have pictures either. I waisted 70 euros.Third the food is not that good. However we found one good restaurant. It's called Remy's restaurant. We also met a really nice woman working there named Mariam. She got us a reservation even though the restaurant was booked solid. We also met an artist in The art of Disney animation who was great to my daughter by the name of Sally.There were more issues but those were the big ones for me. If these issues were remedied, the park would be much better in my opinion. I will never go back.",-1
"We stayed at Disneyland Paris on 31st January 2010 it was very disappointing.We arrived at our bedroom block (Sequoia Lodge) and thought we must be at the staff entrance as there were trolleys of dirty laundry strewn untidily all around the entrance.The door lock on bedroom took about 12 tries to open it. We only kept trying as it was such a long walk back to reception. I am quite used to electronic door keys, and the do require a bit of a    knack    sometimes to open them, but this one was faulty.We heard a member of staff in the corridor and told her the key wasn't working properly. She rudely asked how we had gotten into the room, then, shrugged her shoulders and walked away. I simply couldn   t believe it.The room was dirty     there was rubbish in the ice bucket and the bathroom floor was dirty.The window catch on one window was broken and a metal arm was hanging loose.Reception did not answer the phone when we tried to ring down.There were tiny towels in bathroom and not enough for 4 people as an adult would need two. It was like staying in a really cheap 'motel'.The shows were adequate, but certainly not spectacular. The    Winter Wonderland    party in Frontierland seemed to be more about cutting costs during the off season by having very few cast involved than providing a good show. And the cast could not skate well!     it looked like something put on by an amateur group.We had a nice dinner with the characters in Disney Village and enjoyed the rides, but In general, while the parks themselves have good rides, the staff do not smile nor seem that they are interested in children. There were a couple of good staff and I hate complaining, but really this was not a    magical    experience. We did our absolute best to enjoy the holiday, but we   ve had far, far better.Overall, Disneyland Paris was an expensive holiday, a poor experience andwe will not be returning.",-1
HK disney is boring  go ocean park  go la disney  but dont go hk disney,-1
"Went here with our family. Despite Disneyland Paris getting great reviews I tend to disagree. We went on a Monday in October (not French school holidays) to avoid the crowds. Still, every attraction had a waiting time of roughly 30 45 minutes and some longer. The food is as expected overpriced and bad. Don't see what you can get out of a day here, when you spend most of the time waiting for a few attractions (there are only a handful of them, the rest are parks and shops). Cannot recommend. Have never visited the US Disneyland, perhaps it's better. ",-1
we stayed in the Disney hotel   the cars   it is worst than a travel lodge. cramped rooms with poor facilities. Breakfast was ridiculous   you were allowed one slice of ham! the park itself has hardly any characters in it   it was raining the weekend we went but we didn't actually see any apart from the parade. we booked breakfast at Mickeys diner   which is extremely expensive   and it was a good job we did or my son wouldn't of met any characters at all. Don't go is my advice   save up and go to florida!.,-1
"I know Disneyland is a money machine but hadn   t realised how much service and enjoyment had been sacrificed to achieve this aim. We visited with our 2 grandchildren and entered the park just after the gates opened. Even then it was manic, probably too many people for the park to cope with.The story was Q,Q and Q. The worst was Peter Pan, the board outside said a 100 minute wait but this became an actual 127 minutes! The reason for this is Fast Pass. As a day visitor you are a third class customer. The pecking order starts with those who are on special deals in the resort hotels, then comes those who have paid even more money for Fast Pass. These people are able to queue jump leaving you to watch as they go to the front of the line. The Q situation extended to the catering facilities, even a coffee took 42 minutes. The guy was morose, monosyllabic and unhelpful. There were a number of these    solo    food stations around the site and all seemed to have the same issues. Having visited Disney in California a few years back and loved the experience, Paris was an awful, poor value experience and will not be repeated.",-1
"We visited Disneyland during the time period that everyone again states that it's the slowest post of the season and the park should be empty. Well apparently 1 persons definition of empty is the opposite of mine. Out of our 5 day trip, only 1 morning for 2 hours wasn't absolutley jam packed solid. What amazes me is the sheer volume of people that openly talk about pulling their kids out of school to go to Disneyland for a day. 3 5 days all of toontown was closed except for Micky and Minnie's house. With 1 3rd of the park already closed to build Star Wars, that's simply unacceptable. On several occasions I witnessed children playing with wheelchairs, yet when they went up to rides and adult would sit in it and act injured, when the ride was over they'd get up and walk normally allowing the kids to play in the chair again until the next ride. Disneyland has a horrible policy on disabled persons. To allow that type of abuse is simply ridiculous.AP days are a joke, we got a bottle of water and a tiny pin and got to stand outside in the 95 degree heat, yippee. Last time they had bags of popcorn and it was inside an air conditioned building.With kids back in school the park didn't open until 10am. seriously, that's way too late to open a park that is supposed to cater to small children.The best pointer I can pass along is that whichever park has magic morning, go to the other park instead. The park with magic morning is already overrun and you'll just be standing in line to stand in line again.",-1
"I recently visited your Disneyland Theme Park and I had the absolutely worse and unpleasant experience as I was entering the shuttle area to go into the Disney theme park. Meek yelled at my family and embarrasses us in front of many guests and other staff. And on top of that, she refused to answer our questions about getting to the park! This was outrageous and very poor customer service.My family and I were dropped off in the  Woody  Shuttle area and we were yelled at by a staff member   MEEK (Chicago, IL). She was extremely rude and had poor customer service towards us. I understand that we were confused by which Shuttle area to wait at as there are many stops to choose from, Buzz Lightyear, Woody, ect., however as we were crossing the street to go to the Woody area   she immediately yelled  NO! GO BACK AROUND THE SIDEWALK! . We stopped on the sidewalk and asked  But we are looking for the shuttle to go to the park.  She continues to yell  NO! WALK AROUND THE SIDEWALK! . I responded,  I just have a question about     and she cuts me off by again yelling,  I DON'T CARE, IF YOU HAVE A QUESTION WALK AROUND THE SIDEWALK TO ME! . This was extremely embarrassing for my family by being made a spectacle in front of all of the many guests and staff that were in the area. I couldn't believe my first moment at Disney was so unpleasant. I would have appreciated if she was more civil with her approach and added  Please  or  For your safety, please come towards this side.  But her rude tone and aggression towards my family was uncalled for. To make matters worse, my family walked over to the Woody Shuttle area and when we got there, she REFUSED to answer our question! My family heard her say  I don't want to answer their question. Have someone else talk to them.  That's outrageous that a Disney staff member wouldn't even be willing to help us. First, this staff member(MEEK) yells at and embarrasses my family   and then, she refuses to answer our question. This start of the day completely ruined our Disney trip and we couldn't enjoy the rest of the day. Just because of one poor experience in the beginning. My family flew out all the way from Florida for this one day and it was ruined by one poor staff member. I hope the training could get better for the the shuttle parking staff and that Meek gets the proper repercussion. The parking staff are the very first people to see Disney guests and I would hope that the very first moment at Disney starts as magical and that they understand the importance of a first impression.",-1
The staff here is very rude and racist they don't know how to talk   We indian are very big spender I think Disney Paris does not need Indian tourists   So all Indian groups big no to Disney Paris,-1
"We went to Disneyland for my daughters birthday. We went on a Tuesday and it was extremely packed but the worst part was that it seemed things kept shutting down. We stood in line for Thunder Mountain and after 30 minutes in line we were notified it was shut down so we walked to Splash Mountain which was also shut down and they didn't know when it would be up and running again. Through out the long day we only got to ride 4 rides. I was so disappointed and so was my daughter. With the prices being what they are for a ticket, it was not worth it. ",-1
"I have visited DisneyWorld in Florida numerous times, Dineyland in California, and this summer I took my niece to Disney Paris. The rides were all a little tired, the lines as usual for summer travel, but I was not expecting grown people to cut in front of you, push past, and try to get to the front of the line. The flower beds outside the entrance had weeds growing in them. I have never seen this in any Disney area anywhere. On several occasions I wish I had a tub of baby wipes, and hand sanitizers. If you can afford it, hold out for DisneyWorld in Florida.",-1
"Disneyland Paris is like a giant shopping mall at extreme prices with a few attractions thrown in for good measure. To eat or drink, you probably need your grandmother's inheritance. If you are going for your little ones be aware that most of the more interesting attractions they won't be able to go on due to their height. The ones you can go on, you will likely queue for an hour and be disappointed. Bolshy crowds, extautionate prices and a great deal of walking is what is in store for you. The highlights as we experienced them were the parade at 4.15 pm where you actually get to see most of the princesses (otherwise you only get a quick view or take on the angry crowd for a photo or autograph) and the star wars attraction. Again for the star wars you need to be ready to queue in a hot tunnel for long periods of time. For boys over the age of 7 yet too short for the roller coasters this is the only attraction you can enjoy. Also beware, if you plan on staying at one of the hotels you are about an hour train ride from Paris.",-1
"I have loved Disney for as long as I can remember  my house is decorated Disney style, I know the parks like the back of my hands   I am known as Tink around town.....you get the picture. We paid $40 per plate to see this show up close. Not only was the service at the restaurant terrible  we received our entrees before our drinks  but we were given wrong information about when we could get in for our reserved  standing spots  that we could see very little of the show. Unlike Fantasmic, most of the show is down low on the water  which if you are tall you wont have a problem but if you are on the short side or have children you will not be able to see unless you are first in line. They open at 7:30 for the early showing   we were told to go at 8:15. With priority standing  $40 dinners you get to be let in with all the other priority diners  it is a free for all!!!! Don't get a late dinner. You are better off getting a fast pass   get one first thing in the morning as soon as the park opens and save your money. The bridge going to Ariels grotto is a good viewing spot. Get against the rail if you are short!!! The attraction is a five the priority seating is a rip off!",-1
"There were no fireworks because the castle was undergoing transformation : ( Since it was already a small version, the transformation of some areas made it much smaller : (",-1
"Disappointed and frustrated by our first visit to Disneyland in 30 years. Long lines, closed attractions (Small World, Pirates, others), overpriced entrance fee, overly expensive restaurants ($17 for a sandwich with side serving of grapes!). We stood in line for 30 minutes just for ice cream. When the wait for one attraction was one hour, we passed, went to use our  fast pass  on another attraction but it had broken down. Between the two attractions we TRIED to get on and waiting for ice cream we virtually accomplished nothing in two hours. We visited the park on a day when crowds were anticipated to be at the 3 level (3 out of 10, 10 being the greatest crowds). Trash cans were overflowing while Disney characters were very few and very far between. We never waited less than 20 minutes for any attraction we tried. Disney employees were not the happy folks I remember from prior visits. I'm sure glad we didn't visit on any day greater than a three! While we had times of fun, we pretty much felt ripped off and disappointed. We spent $80 each to just walk in the gates, enjoyed five attractions and left because of the long lines to do everything. Disney needs to do better.",-1
"We drove and got to the park at 10:30 then waited 1 hour to buy a ticket for both parks for 2 adults and 3 teenagers. This cost over 400 euros. When we eventually got in at midday none of the fast passes were working so it was between one and two hours queuing on the big rides. Some rides were broken. We left at 7 and had gone on 4 rides. The staff were nothing like American Disney staff, the rides weren't even as good, loads of people smoked. Do not go here if you get the chance go to Florida it doesn't compare. ",-1
"Having visited both parks now, I am of the firm opinion that this Disney is a much smaller and poorer cousin of the original in LA. We did most of the things we wanted to do and we're out in about 8 hours, where we had stayed much longer in the other park.Having visited LA twice now, the contrast is quite different to me, primarily the dirt and rubbish around the Paris version. Cobwebs everywhere, rubbish in every pool and pond and blowing around the park was terrible. Even the ducks had to swim around ice cream wrappers in the streams.Organisation seemed quite a lot worse and the Main Street parade of 8 or 9 cars and characters was very poor in contrast. The drivers of the cars seemed as though they'd just been told they were out if a job due to the long faces borne by most of them, only one seemed to be happy and enjoying the singalong with the music.Rides were okay but queues ranged from very light (Pirates of the Caribbean) of about 10 minutes wait to 45 minutes (and broken down twice) for turtle roller coaster was beyond belief. Maybe we were lucky on so e but the vast majority were long slow moving queues.In contrast to LA, the constant threat of having a pickpocket steal your valuables and seeing guards outside the perimeter with machine guns does not make you feel at ease, the security staff inside the park may as well not exist for all the use they are and the numbers (in uniform at least) was ridiculous for the number of people in the park should something serious occur.Finding toilets was also a difficulty as there seems to be few of them and spaced badly (maybe I didn't find them all) but markings on maps provided left much to be desired.Sadly, I won't be spending anymore time or money visiting this park as it is dirty, dusty, rubbish everywhere you look and to try and find something to eat and drink was an absolute chore as most stalls were shut, even inside the gift stores at least half of the registers were also closed.Would I recommend Euro Disney? Not at all, save your money and go to LA or Tokyo where the staff are much more helpful and the park is not covered in filth dirt and dust. A 2 day pass is the most you'll require to do just about anything you'd care to do here.",-1
"It all feels like a scam. You pay an absurd amount of money to stand in queues for 45 minutes (for a 1.43 minute ride). You spend the whole day standing and waiting, and then the rides, the food and the activities are below average. The park seems to allow an unlimited people into the park and that is their only objective; making money out of people with children who then feel completely cheated. Everything is expensive, the food is average at best. You spend nine hours in the park and maybe get to five rides. You wait 45 minutes to meet some of the characters and then you are told that they need to take a break and the kids never get to meet the characters. It only does not feel like a scam, it is a scam.",-1
"I am struggling to find anything positive to say about our visit. It was a family visit comprising of grandparents (in our 50's), children (in their 20's) and our 3 year old grandson to spend a day in Disneyland. First thing that we bought was an autograph book for our grandson so as he could fill it up with all of the Disney characters signatures. He left the park with an empty book as there was hardly a single Disney character to be seen. Those that we did see as we walked around every area (two of them all day) rushed past everyone followed by their minders with just a cursory wave of a paw. Where they were heading in such a hurry I'll never know, but not one of them stopped for a child. The Disney staff were just as scarce, apart from those that manned the retail outlets, which appeared to be the overriding aim.... get as much money out of the visitors as possible. Every ride had at least an hours wait, unless of course you paid the extra for the Fast Track. Vending stalls took 20 minutes to serve you. How long can it take to sell someone a fizzy drink? The same to buy a balloon, yet another 20 minute queue. We tried to take the train that runs around the perimeter of the park. We joined yet another queue to see a half filled train leave the station so we gave up on that as well. I don't know whether they allowed too many people in that day or if there were huge staff shortages, but it really was the most disappointing day out imaginable. In fact we could hardly wait to leave the place as we sat there looking at this mass of humanity being fleeced at every turn. My recommendation. Go in Febuary when it is raining. You might then get on a ride and not feel like a sardine.",-1
"Disneyland was disgusting when we were there two weeks ago Wednesday!!! They must be cutting back on help. It just isn't the same anymore. It wasn't even crowded, but my husband and I started to walk into two different restrooms and couldn't use them, we walked right out because they were so filthy!!!We rented a locker and it was filthy too!!! Also, the last 3 visits there, the ponds were so full of algae, they smelled and there were very few ducks!!! I don't blame the ducks, they didn't like that mucky water either!!! We were sitting and eating and got whiffs of the stench. It was a real turn off. They are letting things go. It is so expensive there and they have raised the price of parking, admission, the food and then so many attractions are closed!!! What a rip off!!! We aren't renewing our pass.Walt Disney would be furious!!!",-1
"On the day of travelling back home we decided to spend the day at Disney and we had our passaports stolen at one of the park stores. Very dissapointing as we missed our flights and a huge mess to get new passaports. Apart from the stress from having our passaports stolen, the support from Lost&Found department was very bad and we had no support from the park. On your visit be very careful with your valuables!!",-1
"It was our first time visit of disneyland. the decoration, the atmosphere and the characters seems to be you are in your fairytale. The roller coasters and machines with full entertainment BUT there are too many guests and you have to wait for everything. If you dont have fast pass, you have to wait minimum 40 60 min. for a single ride. If you want to eat something you have to wait, if you want to shop yes you have to wait! You can not take a photo with your favorite character because there are huge lines and characters are not there everytime.You can check the line times from the applications but because of the crowd you got exhausted.But the prade show and end show is hilarious.Not for adults: if you do not like children please think again for disneyland :)they are everwher with screams:)",-1
We had a terrible day at Disney Paris The staff never smile and half the rides are being renovated which is appalling during the busiest time of year.There were no characters to see in the streets and not enough carriages open with refreshments throughout the parks.Lunch at lucky nuggets was the only thing we liked but the staff don't smile I guess that's a French people thing !!!!Putting it out there because we've been to the Disney Orlando and Anaheim and this park disappointed us.To the point were we were very upset even when waiting for the return shuttle bus there were no benches to sit and everyone sat on the street curb. Would it be a lot to ask for a few park benches?I won't be back EVER!!!!!!,-1
"My family is not wealthy by any means, but we wanted to take my kids to Disneyland. We finally arranged a trip to California and Disney was the main goal. We got there at opening time and there is way too much gimmicky overpriced stores to have to walk thru to get to the rides. Then when it comes time to wait in line for a ride, prepare for a standing wait of up to an hour or more. My son is severely handicapped. By noon the park was so crowded, he was gettng jostled, pushed, shoved. We finally found where to get a large stroller but with the crowds it was next to impossible to push the stroller thru. The lowlite of the day was when we went on the Haunted Mansion ride. There were so many people crowded into the ride that I couldnt see or hear what was going on. At one point, people are told to hop onto some moving cars to continue on to the end of the ride. There were 4 of us in the group. My mother and other son managed to get on a car. My son and I were being left behind and it was EXTREMELY hazardous for my son with a paralyzed leg to  hop  onto a moving car that is in water. As I saw my mother and other child disappearing, I THREW my handicapped child into an already occupied car and jumped into it AS IT MOVED. Then I angrily told the female attendant  THIS BOY IS DISABLED . at which time she shrugged and said  WELL, YOU DIDNT TEL ME . There is no way I could have told her anything because of the crowd and noise level in the room. I sat there thru the rest of the ride and cried, my arms shaking. Totally ruined my trip to be mistreated and have my son at risk. Many rides at Disneyland are old and outdated, with tinny music and dirty cars. The crowd level is dangerous and ridiculous. The prices are way too high. But mostly, I give this park a THUMBS DOWN for special needs people.",-1
"We were very excided about visit Disneyland Park this was planned to the highlight of our holiday in US   but it was almost a nightmare...We choosed a weekday, in September   hoped less people because of school day...The end of the line was at Harbor Blvd before 9 o'clock... At security check we had to throw away our selfie stick, I don't know why because later in the park we saw that many people used. Finally we could enter to the park after 1 and half hour waiting (with a 5 years old kid). In the park everywhere had to wait 10 20 30 minutes for a ride   terrible!!! There were lot of people with stroller, finally it was impossible to walk without hit a stroller... And so on and so on. We asked a girl from the staff and she told it was a very strong Monday..Finally I can give only one advise to the management, please limited the number of sold tickets for a day   because it was a very bad experience for us because of the too many visitors.",-1
"My family and I travelled 16 hours from Australia to enter the magical enchanted world of Disneyland. Well I can tell you the only land we encounted was pram land!! You can't take a selfie stick into the park yet you can take a double decker pram (stroller) that takes up the whole path. They let so many people into the park that you can't tell the lines for the rides from the paths that lead around the theme park. Parades were ok... But destroy half the excitement when they close all the attractions for it. Overall we spent a small fortune to go on only two rides in a whole day. Fast path works, but it can be just as long a line to get to the fast path ticket booth as it is for the ride itself. There are two hundred times as many people in the park as there are seats, so don't expect to sit down to eat your lunch. So disappointed ",-1
"Just returned from 4 days at Disneyland Paris.This is our third trip there, the other two being 7 & 9 years ago. Unfortunately this was our worst experience of the parks, I would estimate that approx. 40% of the main park is shut for refurbishment, now I appreciate that they need to keep up with maintenance as the parks are open all year around & many reviews over the last year or two say the park is now quite tired, but this is ridiculous! we had two very disappointed kids with the rides they were both looking forward to the most shut down.Big Thunder Mountain   shut.Rock 'n Roller Coaster  shutStar Tours  shutFrontier land Railroad station  shutMain street railroad station   shutDiscovery land railroad station   shutPeter Pans flight   shutPirate Galion   shutPocahontas Indian Village  shutDiscovery land Theatre   shut.Adventure Island   shutPirates beach   shutRobinson treehouse  shutDrogon under the castle   shutOn two of the days for our visit the autopia car ride was shut too due to poor weather.Only one parade through the day & NONE in the studios!along with countless shops, restaurants & most of frontier & discovery land which just has hoardings up making it difficult to get around.My advice would be download the app & check the rides which are closed for refurbishment as Disney are not charging any less for a ticket with huge amounts of the park closed! FYI these closures don   t look tempory as noticed a sign on the Star Tours hoarding saying re opening in 2017 some time!!!Due to all the closures the rest of the attractions were very busy, times like 80mins for Crush roller coaster, 140min for Ratatouille & 60min for Buzz lightyear were all common throughout our stayBest avoid for a year or two",-1
"This place is a rip off. Overpriced for the unsuspecting vulnerable tourist . Have visited this place, and the other Disney properties many times over the years. Always known for terrible food and high prices which were cheap prices by todays standards. The review posted by the former employee amusement park reviewer critic is insulting. Some are not former hosts yet allare entitled to their opinion if the goods and services met or did not meet their expectations for their hard earned dollars spent. The reviews are written on the trip advisor site that folks can think for themselves and weigh if this  what we would consider a plastic, half  operating magic kingdom really worth the investment of time and money. All this is not to sparethe public, but to inform them that they can make the decision if this is where they want to go and if this is what they want to do based on experiences of others.Clearly for some of us it is not.",-1
"Dirty, Smelly, rude staff, lots of rides closed, lots of shows not on, and no it's not because I've been to Disney in America. It was a waste of money and I'd never advise anyone to visit.",-1
"We visited HK Disneyland in the month of July, I'm guessing it was school holidays in neighbouring China, so there were hoards of Chinese tourists. The queues were Long and we had to wait a minimum of 45 minutes for each ride, the queues were very badly managed by the Disneyland authorities. Some of the quiet were suffocating as there were no fans even and hardly any place to stand due to the winding queues. To add to it, the Neighbouring crowd were very noisy and had total disregard for others, and were happily cutting queues at every opportunity without any guilt or consideration for young kids who were standing on the line.We managed only a few rides for our 7 year old Daughter due to the Long queues, however the evening parade and the fireworks display was a treat to watch and made up for the day's misery.",-1
"We visited Disney Paris April 11 15 with our two little girls who are 3 and 5. We were a litte disappointed and so were our girls who really wanted to see the princesses. They were no where to be found. We saw every other character in the parades, character dinners etc.., but not a princess to be found until our last day we saw Snow White and Sleeping Beauty over by  Small World   ride. We had to wait in really long lines to see them both. I even asked at our hotel  The Disneyland Hotel  and they could not tell me where to find them. They just shook their head saying they have no idea what characters will be where. I could not believe my ears. Were we really at  Disney ???? I had to tell my kids that the princess were on a little vacation this week. It was heart breaking, truely. There was a castle and a whole  Princess Stage  area next to the castle, but no performances. I just could not believe it. I am sure my girls were not the only ones disappointed. Our weather was perfect during our entire stay which I think made the park even more busy than usual. The lines were unreasonably long for my two kids and so was the garbage everywhere. They bathrooms were even worse. I could not believe how many garbage cans were overflowing with garbage. And the bathrooms were so dirty and smelly I completely walked out of one and ran back to our hotel room just to use the toilet. I had a friend that visited in early March during a time the weather wasn't so nice and it was still very crowded and she also said the same thing that the garbage cans were overflowing every where and the bathrooms were just horrible.As for our hotel  The Disneyland Hotel, my husband and I were disappointed in the quality of the hotel. Yes, the location was perfect! The pool was not that great for young kids who are learning how to swim. Our room was really in need of updating ie...the bathroom, capet, linens. Personally we stayed at the Holiday Inn outside the park one night, and I thought it was nicer due to the updated bathroom etc... It was just newer all around. As for the food, well it was no doubt expensive. We enjoyed all of our dinner experiences at the hotel buffet  Inventions , Chef Mickey was outstanding food, but again all really expensive. I felt our lunchtie meals were more limited to  unhealty foods or fast foods . It would have been nice to have healthier selections. Our kids enjoyed the food as well.To be fair, I will say that we did enjoy our trip, but for the money we spent we expected much better quality  Disney Quality . We were at Walt Disney World last year around this same time and we had none of the same problems or experiences. We are not sure if we would recommend doing this trip if you have not been to  The Walt Disney World  nothing really compares to it. I would really like to return but can't see spending that kind of money for such poor quality of services.. Sorry Disneyland Paris.",-1
"Most disappointed that our two little ones were so badly served at Disneyland. Waiting in line for 45 mins for the Dumbo ride not fun, and over in a flash. Waits for the toilet and to eat in a restuarant added to the woe. By the time we had worked out that fast passes could be issued for some rides, it was too late, they had finished. All in all, bad value for our particular family group. We heard people say it was exceptionally busy yesterday. We had travelled from UK with our grown up children and 2 grandchildren aged 2, and thought we'd treat our family to a magical day. It did not live up to expectations at all.",-1
"I think ones response might depend on what one was expecting. I went with my two youngest daughters (who regarded it as a trip of a lifetime) and was expecting a general standard comparable with other family focused entertainment. To enter there was a queue (or more accurately a jostling crowd) waiting for over 90 minutes in the hot sun with no shelter, drinks or entertainment (09:00 10:30). Only when we got to the gates that we found that this was the bag check (there was no way of knowing this or indeed of getting through   although bigger adults were shoving past smaller children I think they still only gained 15 20 mins). After that the ticket queue began which was an additional 60 minutes complete with ticket touts (or rather scammers   they did not actually have any tickets   just wanted money). Shelter from the sun at least, but no food, drinks or entertainment   very tough on a five year old and nine year old   and plenty of  attitude  from the staff who I think resent having to work in somewhere like this. (10:30 11:30) Very expensive entry prices for the travesty that we were about to experience which I'll report separately.BTW: In response to the other visitors   we speak excellent French and generally find no problem at all in France.",-1
"I've been to a few of Disney parks in US and Hong Kong, and this is not like them, there are almost no characters in the park, in the princess pavilion (which in other country's have multiple characters) you stand for an hour to take picture with only one princess, which was very disappoining for my 6 years old. Every toilet we went into was dirty, and the queues were very long, even if there weren't a lot of people, the staff are more busy talking to each other than making sure the queue is progressing and that was on both the rides and restaurants . I know that always some of the rides are closed, but there were quite a lot of rides closed. As appose to other Disney parks, which I will be glad to go again, I will not come back to this park.",-1
"Just returned from 5 days at the parks. In our opinion this is not a magical, happy and fun place to go with your kids. The Disneyland staff are rude, with afew exceptions . It certainly is nothing like Disney world Florida . If you fancy this type of break is save your money and go to Alton towers resort or something similar! A total waste of   1000 for us. Wish I'd have paid off my council tax bill instead! Terrible place. And as for the Disney hotel ( Cheyenne) grubby is the word I'd use! Don't bother, save your money.",-1
"Disneyland in the US is said to be the happiest place on earth, and it is. Disneyland Paris is like a knock off franchise that I can only assume is run by someone other than Disney. Where do I start:1. They closed off parts of the park starting at 7PM although the park was  open  until 10PM. Of course, they put up no signage and had not staff to direct patrons, so many people walked into section to find all rides and exits closed and had to wander around to find their way out.2. People were lining up for broken rides, but the staff (standing 5 feet way) weren't telling anyone that the ride was closed. The growing line caused major traffic jams. 3. We wait an hour for a ride that was then announced as  temporarily closed . It closed with us at the front on the line. Because we were next, we asked how long they expected the ride to be  temporarily  closed. Because it was 3 hours before park close, they told us that they didn't plan to even try to fix the ride. In other words, not temporary and no interest in fixing it. In all, we probably spent over 2 hours of our day waiting in line for broken down rides or trying to find our way out of closed sections of the park.4. Characters do not walk around the park as they do in the US, but you can stand in line for 90 minutes or more to see a character. We didn't; we were afraid that when we got to the front of the line, we'd be told the character was broken.5. There's a general lack of variety with the restaurants; restaurant staff aren't friendly at all; and many restaurants are far too small to provide seating for patrons and there's no public seating nearby. We were in a restaurant were people were fighting for tables, sitting on the floor, etc.6. The kids really wanted popcorn. We waited 20 minutes in a line that wasn't moving. I realized that it wasn't moving because their popcorn kiosks are manned by a single worker who both scoops popcorn (without gloves) using the same hands that take money and dispense change. I told the kids that they may as well go around and lick the hands of everyone in the part, if they're going to eat that dirty popcorn. Rack up another wasted 20 minutes standing in line. 7. And just to top it all off, when we finally left, it was impossible to find the exit. They wouldn't let us out the gates, we had to walk through a shop. Then some jerk employee was blocking the entrance to the train station and told us to walk around some gate while others were going straight through.Disney really needs to cut this bad franchise loose as it sullies their name. They need to send the  Undercover Boss  to this place to see how bad it is.",-1
"We are an American family living in Europe. We drove into Paris for 9 days and one day decided to do Disneyland for the kids. We decided to go on a Tuesday in Late October thinking that there would be less crowds. WRONG! Disneyland and Disney Studios is much smaller than other Disney parks. However, the lack of order and management are the real concern, but perhaps this is just a French thing? The French patrons of the park DO NOT like to wait in lines for things so people jumping the line and cutting in front of others is rampant. The park management does nothing about this, so it makes the experience unpleasant for those of us trying to follow the rules.Fast Pass. We thought that at least we could use the fast pass system to ride some things. NOPE. The park opened at 0800 and we got through the gates at 0830. At 0830 ALL FAST PASSES WERE SOLD OUT. Isn't that impossible? Can't you only hold one fast pass at a time? I guess not. I think that you can go around to all the fast pass machines and collect as many as you want right at the beginning. All the fast pass machines were being covered up and roped off when we went looking for them at 0830 0900. Ridiculous!Don't visit this park, it's just not worth it.",-1
"The sea of people at Disneyland is SO CRAZY !! OMG !! They let way to many inside the park. We had a good time and made the best of it. Went on a few rides, most rides had a 1 2 hour wait but some had 15 30 min wait. You can still have fun, but at times it's just WAY TO MANY PEOPLE !! It's like being in a mosh pit at a concert. ! I love Disyland but !!!!!!!!!! ",-1
"Make this quick. MaxPass it! Schedule the rides. Try to do the early in times as well. Prepare for rude people after 1pm, lots of stroller road rage, try to keep your family safe! next time we know but I think I will wait another year before returning. We will try California adventure this summer.",-1
"Went there and it was SLIGHTLY drizzling. It was signal number 3 (this was posted but no further details or notes added). Upon paying and entering we found out that NO outdoor rides would open that they and at around 12NN they announced that the fireworks is cancelled. We went home at around 1PM and saw that the line was still long at the entrance, the customers had no idea that Disneyland rides were not to be used that day.A sign outside along the signal number 3 should have been put. What a waste of HK549 and HK109 (food). I went to HK for this.",-1
"Not sure if it was because we went on a Friday, but the park was so busy it was difficult to walk through some parts. All of the rides had ridiculous queues, and even with the fast passes needed to come back 3 4 hours later. We queued up twice for the Indiana jones ride, and both times got to the front and the ride broke down. Wasted 3.5 hours of our day for nothing. No sympathy or reimbursement from the staff either. Rides were all quite average, would highly recommend next door (California adventure park) for much faster, more efficient queues and more modern rides!",-1
"Great transport by train from Solihull to Disney. The Disney experience was appalling. Stayed in Sequoia Lodge, the door lock system does not work, the manager admitted that it was a 1992 system that badly needed replacing, but they had been refused permission to spend on the replacement system. Far too many rides and food outlets were closed, frustrating a lot of people. Rides also breaking down too much. Before going I doubted the French' ability to emulate their parent company's country's ability to host such an enterprise. Our visit only confirmed that it is not in the nature of the French to make you feel welcome and the events special. On the Disney channel in room one of the claims was that you can relax as all the on park transport is free, well no it isn't, some is but the train that takes you from your accommodation to the park entrance is 2 euros per person. Not in the Disney spirit at all. As for the breakfast experience at the lodge, despite the genuine and good natured efforts of the far too many black faces that do the menial work, the experience is one of being cattle herded. Very poor. Finally the name of the park defies the trades description act. It is not EuroDisney at all, and should be renamed FrancoDisney. It is very French, which would be fine if that had been what it was marketed as, but it is not. Thank heavens that we have a great family, otherwise this trip would not have been enjoyable at all.",-1
Like the title says. Over crowded and over priced. Went from being the happiest place on earth to hour long lineups unhappy parents and cranky kids. Walt must be turning in his grave with all the commercialism.,-1
I went there last Saturday with my friends. We decided to buy a photopass to register the moments at the breakfast with the characters and in some rides. The staff member at the shop guaranteed that would have loads of professional photographers around but we didn't see any.No photographers at the breakfast and just a couple of rides with the service. Two of them not even operating that day. Result we spent 60 euros for 10 pictures.We tried to talk to a member of staff but he didn't show much interest and just sent us to the city hall that was at the other side of the park and it was packed so we gave up.We asked directions to a show and another member of staff said the show was over and it hadn't even started yet. After over an hour in two of the biggest attractions they had technical problems and didn't bother to give us even a fast pass to come back later... staff said that we have to come back later and queue again.Disneyland Paris never again!It's better go to Orlando... I've been there 2 times before and never had a problem. ,-1
Way over crowded and unless you sat along the parade route early afternoon till parade started Disney employees would hear people along the side walk and not permit people to stop and watch. Overall I am very disappointed in the way Disney is now operating. Lines are huge for food; rides and two see characters. A lot of the mentioned previously was at least an hour or up to 2 hour waits.Finding think this is what Walt had in mind when Disney was created.,-1
"Rides broken down, terrible food and long queues.  Also found the staff and other park users very rude.",-1
"My second visit to Disneyland Paris and most certainly my last. The last time I went I though that the very long waiting and queueing times was just because it was in the middle of summer. Well this time it was a cold day in March and still had to queue for an hour for a ride of less than 5 minutes. This place is really not value for money at any stretch of any ones imagination. With 6 of the best attractions closed you may have thought they would make a cheaper entrance price, no chance. Once you are in there you pay absolutely the top rate for everything. The food is mostly junk food but very expensive junk food. The cheapest small bottle of water is over 3.00 Euro. I can only advise if you do go there, take everything with you to eat and drink or it will cost you a fortune. They also encourage a two tier society with their  fast pass  and VIP passes, but all it does is make it obvious to anyone having paid a fortune to go in that it is perfectly okay to dodge the queue, and so those waiting just get to wait a lot longer than normal. Whoever thought this up was not thinking properly or about the person wanting to take a few small kids on as many rides as possible to give them a good day out. No you just end up in different queues for 5 to 6 hours to spend a total of 40 minutes on rides. It is just not worth a tenth of what theye charge to go in",-1
"Wasted 1 hour driving to remote parking in morning that was counter to all online directions.  Poor planning, poor communications to public, waste of customer money and time.  We travel to Disneyworld annually and this is experience does not meet the standards of Disney.  Boooo",-1
"So...the last time I came to Disneyland Park was nearly 20 years ago and have fond memories of the place. Much has changed since then and I decided to come again the day before Halloween, perhaps that was my biggest mistake. We arrived at 1PM and it was unbelievably crowded, judging from the research I've done after the visit, I guess this Park attracts more locals and it seemed that way. Wait times were at least 40   50 minutes all around and Fast Passes were 5 hours   and desperate to just get out of one area, we decided to brave a 50 minute wait for a specific ride (Indie Jones).Now, granted the line does move so you're not really standing still for a long period of time. That I have to give them credit for doing a good job.So the above mentioned are things neither I nor Disney have much control over (apart from when I choose to visit). Here is what I was disappointed about:1) I understand that rides get updated but there were a couple of updates that detracted from the rides   Indiana Jones   I remember there used to be a boulder rolling towards us in the end and the train would seem to hurtle towards it before dropping and that was the end of the ride. Now, no boulder but you still have Indie hanging from up there and I didn't understand a word he said. Very anti climactic.2) Haunted Mansion has gone completely Tim Burton's Nightmare before Christmas now and towards the end there used to be a holographic mirror you went by and there would be a ghoul or grizzly seated beside you, now I had a roll of Christmas wrapping paper? Someone else had Dr. Zeuss' hat? What?!3) The employees were SOUR!! Whatever happened to the Happiest Place on Earth? You'd think they were working in the Most Miserable Place on Earth. They were not of good cheer, friendly, they were chatting amongst themselves and herding cattle.4) Speaking of herding cattle, hey at least entertain us while we're waiting in line especially when the waits get pretty up there like 50, 75, 80 minutes long. A person or two coming out to entertain or talk to us in character of the ride would work? I think Club Med does a better job at that...I kinda feel like I dealt with a bad pimp during my visit   they took my money, under delivered, and didn't care about my experience. Now, I've never been to a pimp, but I'm just saying'...We did have reservations at the Blue Bayou for lunch and that was good. No complaints there.But after 6 hours we still had not finished our rides in Adventureland and Critter Country and the riff raft was ballooning, I threw in the towel and headed back to the hotel for a glass of champagne instead.Maybe I'll try again on a rainy weekday in January away from any holidays or events...",-1
"On April 25th 28th 2016, my wife and I spent three days visiting the Disney Parks at Anaheim California. This was our first visit to Disneyland, we have visited the Orlando Disney Parks in three occasions.Most of our time was spent at Disneyland. We selected the time of our visit (after Easter and before Summer) on the assumption that it would be less crowded. Well, we could not have been more wrong. The crowds were enormous, and the lines and waiting times were very long, usually around 30 45 minutes. In many cases it was nearly impossible to move around the parks without bumping into people or nearly hitting some baby stroller.We used the fast passes whenever possible, but for some attractions, we had to wait in line for at least 30 minutes or more. Adding to our frustrations was that in several instances, after standing in line for 30 minutes or so, the attraction or ride suffered some sort of mechanical problem. This was exactly what happened to us on the Peter Pan ride. When we almost reached the end of the line, there was some sort of mechanical problem, and no one could tell us whether the ride could go back in operation. Because, of this, and because there was no easy exit from the line, we had to jump over barriers and ropes. This was difficult considering our ages.That sort of annoyance also happened at the Winnie the Pooh ride. A similar, and even more frustrating situation happened to us with the  Rollicking Roadsters  at the California Adventures Park. It took us three attempts to finally get on this ride which broke down twice.The Anaheim parks seem to be smaller than the Orlando ones, this perhaps adds to the crowded conditions we encountered. Also, Disneyland does not offer Meal Plans or on  line fast passes. I must also add that in all our visits to Orlando Parks we never encountered so many rides and attractions out of service or breaking down.Our recommendation is that if you want to enjoy the  Disney Magic , you should go to Orlando and during off season times. The parks are larger, they seem to be less crowded, and there are better services, more attractions, more conveniences, and lodgings options..We did little in terms of shopping at the parks or at Downtown Disney, but we were shocked by the high prices of food, drinks, souvenirs, etc. Perhaps there was a time when Disneyland was the  Happiest Place on Earth , but that seems to be long in the past.",-1
"This park looks the same as it did when I went here forty years ago for the first time. I recently returned and was so disappointed that nothing had changed. I suppose that's what many people tend to like about it, but there are ways to spruce things up with out losing the charm. Looks like nothing has been done to update things. There are just so many people here, even on low days, that you can't enjoy yourself. Forget about getting any kind of bargains, that's not possible. It's so expensive to spend a day here that you have wonder how so many people can bring their children here for a holiday. Amazing. ",-1
It's a really nice Park!  But nothing todo really.   Only 3 goods rides.  The place needs a serious update! pronto  It's over priced!,-1
You pay an entrance fee and then you have to queue for any ride!!! eventually you end up speding time and money in the stores...,-1
"i wouldn't recommend going to Disney unless you have kids under the 48 inch height or if you love queuing up for over a hour and half. Disney doesn't seem to have a shut of point of how many people they let in! apparently we went on a quiet day when ques where still so long! we had the 3 day park pass and did the california adventure park which was okay not as busy as the disney land park. we just left after being in the park for an hour, as i think queuing up for over an hour is a waste of time! even doing the fast passes didnt get you in any quicker and you only really makes you cut 50% of the line. even the ques for food and drink lines were ridiculously long! i would not recommend going to disneyland and think there are far better parks out there!the rides need updating as there old and obsolete! a lot of the rides are not disney based which you would expect to see in a disney park. this was by far the worst theme park i have ever been to!",-1
"Very disappointing place. We spend 3 days there but could have done it in a day. There are 4 rides that are worth waiting around for and even they are not particularly high octane. The staff vary from sullen to obnoxious, there are 4 shops selling overpriced novelty crap, for every one place to eat and by the way, the food is horrendous and a rip off. I left Disneyland Paris feeling very cynical.",-1
"My husband is a Disney phile. So we excitedly rode the RER out here. It was small, but we expected that. What we did not expect was how run down it was   how many rides kept breaking down over and over and over (took 3 tries to get onto Ratatouille   our main reason for going there!). The stores are WAY OVERPRICED and very small   could not believe how tiny the World of Disney was! Very limited sizes in merchandise. And they were out of buttons! You know, the buttons you get to celebrate a birthday, or first visit, etc. That was one of the 2 main souveneirs I wanted from France   that and a Disneyland Paris sweatshirt. I came home with neither. Surprisingly how few employees speak reasonable English compared to the rest of the country.",-1
"Save your money n just go to OceanPark. The HK Disney experience is terrible. Over priced, under sized. Not rewarding like Calif or FL. Save your money n go to the states. Attendance is down. Walt would be sad.",-1
While park and ride was ok .. Met a v rude staff managing the parade .. totally shocked.. won't recommend this park,-1
"I worked in Eurodisney 20 years ago when I was a Student. I decided to come back this year with was my children aged 6 and 8. What a disappointment!!!!! We arrived on a very warm and sunny Sunday, probably the first one of the year. We stayed in the hotel NewYork where the check in, despite being very busy, was done in an efficient manner. All was well until we entered the park which was crowded (beyond capacity in my view). Every attraction showed between 50 and 60 minutes wait. A  fast pass  system was on offer which consisted in reserving a time slot and booking a ticket for the attraction in advance. when I went to book the tickets for the attractions, I soon found out that the earlier slot available was 2 hours later. This meant that we were not able to go on any attraction for the first 2 hours, so we decided to have a bite to eat instead but we soon found out that every restaurant (mostly fastfood that we don't particularly like) were totally packed and required a good 30 mns of queueing) we gave up that as well and looked around for somethingelse to do which did not require more than 10  15 minutes of queueing. We found a few things here and there without much interest, such as the visit of a crowded pirate ship and a dusty treehouse. It was finally time to go to to Star tour attraction. I was totally amazed to see that the film showed ( with a few effects) was exactly the same as 20 years ago. Same for the pirateship. It soon became apparent that most attractions were exactly as they were 20 years ago, nothing has been modernized and as a result the overall impression is of a dusty dated place with decors and automats that are outdated. The only available places to go without queueing are the Disney shops present all over the parc and village. I would have preferred to see more attractions and amenities and less shops. The Disney culture seems to be  milk people as much as possible with the least investment possible. ur concierge at the hotel recommended a restaurant for dinner called the Blue lagoon, apparently one of the most decorated one in the parc, it turned out to be one of those tacky places yet again totally outdated where one eat in the dark surrounded by fake coconuts and boats that are passing by and waving whilst we are eating. The food (mostly fish) was not fresh, and clearly reheated frozen food. terrible, except for the nice waiter who did make an effort and was lovely. i could go on and on with the bad experiences we had, such as queueing 20 minutes for an attraction and finally reaching the front of the line, to be told by microphone that  the attraction due to technical problems is now closed  ... There were a few good things worth mentioning though, the newest part of the parc called the Studios, were much less crowded and rather nice. the attraction in the hotel tower is absolutely great and so is the show at 11h30 which shows how to film an action movie with cars and motorbikes chases involving water fire and all sort of special effects. One last thing to mention which was also very difficult to swallow, is that despite charging 79 euro for an adult day ticket in the parc ( price for guests not staying in the hotels) There are still a lot of places where people have to pay extra, hot air balloons, giant balls on the ice ring etc...one thing is sure we will never come again, instead we will return time and again in Europa parc which in my view, despite being more expensive, offers a much much better value for money",-1
"After 24 days of travel in China, I decided to satisfy my daughter's insistent requests to visit Hong Kong Disneyland. Well, that was a disappointment: the park is very small, expecially when compared to the ones in the US, and, considering the number of visitors, the time spent in the heat queuing can soon become unbearable (only 2 attractions offer fastpass). The cost of the entrance ticket is huge and even drinks and food are quite expensiive.I also found the park lacking some of that special Disney atmosphere which makes Disney theme parks unique and attractive not only to kids but also to adults.The park is very clean and, unlike other reviewers, we did not have any problems with the local visitors.",-1
"It is very bad experience and the waiting time is to much foe each game, and the fast pass is vey bad idea ,at least they have to make an option for the game as fast lane in universal studios , veryyyyyyyy baaaaaaaaaaaaaad experience and my advice if you wang to come, come only to walk and see , really you do not need to wait one hour for five minute game .",-1
"We end up our holidays in Paris with a one day in Disneyland, that was a gross amount of our budget. We realized ticket entrance is more expensive(65   ) if you are not on the frenxh website(55   )!Disney is dissapointing. It's old and attractions hasn't been reniewed with actual technology.but don't expect to find great attractions (average 1hour waiting for 2 3minutes attraction), go to feel traditional vintage pictures and fairytale atmosphere from Disney. They should put more characters walking around the park (no seen Daisy for my daughter) to make pictures with. There are only few and long queues for a pic.More enchanting animation needed and less shops and money takers. The innocence spirit is gone...and staff motivation as well...Overpriced,but still a must go.",-1
"I loved the park itself, I really did. We spent 13 hours here from 10am 11pm... since it was a one day visit, so we were expecting to have all of our meals here, and to try some different food. Despite the fact that many of the rides had a wait of around 2 hours and some of the staff were pretty rude, the rides were great fun and the parade was fabulous (from what we could see, you have to park yourself into a space 45 minutes before the parade starts so that you can actually see it. There is few, if any, high vantage points). So, with the majority of guests spending the entire day within the park, DLP have a captured market of tens of thousands of people per day; naturally you would expect there to be a varied choice of establishments to dine. Nope. Nearly every quick service area in DLP serves the same food, despite the various interesting names and appearance of the caf  s; horrendously presented, frozen garbage clearly from an industrial sized box wrapped individually in plastic. And they charge you extortionate prices for the pleasure. Even though the caf  s are in different themed sections of the park, the menus remain largely the same. In Florida, each section has its own theme going on, and it continues with the food. DLP seriously lacks in diversity when it comes to food options.Onto the restaurants, don't expect to be able to take a spontaneous trip to DLP and be able to book a dinner reservation after 1pm. You will be sorely disappointed. Many of the restaurants are closed after 7:30 (WHY?! The park closes at 11pm!) meaning that the ones open after this time are absolutely swamped. This must create an illusion of exclusivity for DLP that they enjoy... the restaurants appear constantly busy and so people believe they are worth visiting. From what I hear, it's a very expensive variation of what you receive in the quick service caf  s. So after a long day of eating terrible, terrible food, we were forced to eat in one of the quick service areas again. Not what I expected from Disneyland Paris. So, so disappointed.",-1
"This place is much too overcrowded and over priced which took all of the fun out of our visit. First, long lines to get through security. Then long lines to purchase very expensive tickets. Then long lines to use our expensive tickets and enter an overcrowded park. Then long lines for every ride and amusement (many exceeding one hour). Then discovering that my favorite rides we closed. No Pirates of the Caribbean, no Matterhorn, no train, no Tom Sawyer's Island, and no Mark Twain paddle wheeler. Then to have two rides break down after waiting in long lines (Haunted Mansion and Space Mountain.) Then to wait in long lines for overpriced and bland food, and discovering that they had run out of forks and napkins. Then to wait in long lines for a rest room. Then to take a really hard look at many of the worn out buildings, and being turned off by old out of date rides (submarine, Autopia, Small World). Then to find expensive snacks ($4.00 for a chocolate chip cookie? Come on!!!). The Magic is Gone from Disneyland. Walt Disney would be embarrassed and ashamed. It's not the park I knew as a kid in the 60s and 70s. Corporate greed at its very worst. Don't go here. Don't go here. Please do not go here!!!",-1
"We've been to Disney world three times in the past five years so decided to give Disneyland a go this time. We went mid week in October and the resort was as busy as I've seen on a weekend at Disneyworld. The whole day was ruined as we only got on four rides and walking around was like being part of a chaotic parade, with bumping, jostling and challenges to get anywhere. Disney needs to do better and limit access to the park. Selling unlimited tickets is a terrible experience for guests and terrible value as well. ",-1
"50 120min waits for rides despite having payed for a hotel within the park. Very poorly organised (a long queue and places empty within rides) many rides in maintenance or    out of order    when you   re already waiting 30min in line. We chose Disney because our daughter wanted to see her    heroes      well, it was a 2h wait for a    meet and greet    to get a picture. Very expensive restaurants within the park (45 euros for 3 people for very poor fast food, a sandwich, mac n cheese and a salad). The staff were badly trained. We will not be back, not worth the money. ",-1
"Have to say that we last did Disney ten years ago and then we were highly impressed, however it would seem that little has changed since our last visit, apart from the price increase and the site starting to look a little shabby and tired. Not much by way of change in that time. The electronic ticket booths for collection of tickets ordered online didn't work, and so after queuing once already to use it, we were then forced to go and join yet another huge queue to get tickets that we have booked and paid for months in advance. For the price I would have expected the ticket machine at least to work.The biggest disappointment, however, was the attitude of the staff, with some of them struggling to crack a smile. Long gone is the Disney positive sunny attitude, and to be frank the attitude and appearance of some of the staff was appalling. Really sad as this used to be a great resort. On one of the days we visited, we queued for one of the rides only for it to be closed for the day as we were about to board. Safety first is fair enough, but a massive waste of time. The toilets were absolutely rank with many of them not working and the stench was horrendous. The queues at times were completely meaningless as entire families jumped from lane to lane. All just leaves an unsavoury taste behind.If you still fancy going, bring your own food, as the focus is on overpriced junk food. For the same price, we packed a gourmet picnic with change left over.That said on the positive side, the rides we went on were great fun, but all in, I think I would rather have spent the day at Alton Towers. The little one enjoyed it though which is just as well as it was her birthday treat. Have to say I was totally underwhelmed! One day might give Florida a bash, but I'm done with Disney for now!",-1
"August 17   very poor. Expensive for park tickets, parking and refreshments. Queues lengthy and 3 of first four rides broke down which caused significant delays and in one case after 30 minutes in the queue we were told to leave as the ride was now broken. All in all, a waste of time for 4 adults and 4 children. Filthy and simply not cared for any more. Typically commercial, not as it was 10 years or more ago! Stay at home and spend your money wiser.",-1
"When one thinks of 'Disneyland Paris', one sees a true haven, heaven for the kids with magic bouncing off the walls like rainbows after sunlight breaks through a monsoon, and a place for adults to also, somehow get enjoyment out of the place too, and you all go skipping down the promenade holding hands while some beautiful music softly plays out of the tannoys.Stop right there, my friend. This is all a dream. Welcome to reality, and Disneyland Paris just doesn't cut it. We as a family, me aged 17, my sister aged 5, and my mum and stepdad went out there for a two day break (Friday and Saturday), as we were travelling from Center Parcs near to Laon on the Friday, the first day was really just a half day as we needed to do the one million things that come along with travelling and arriving. But enough of the tangent, this is our experience.We arrived on Friday afternoon, and we went in straight away after parking the car. Little did we know that there was going to be a huge walk to actually get into the park, even when you're parked in 'Zone A'. Annoying. However the travellators do take some of the weight off of your feet but only temporarily as more pressure is piled on when you hear the out of date, tacky music that is played at probably 100dB right above your ears when entering the park, of which I'm sure is a health and safety risk. Oh and how could I forget? Every minute or so a 'Welcome' message is played as well! A nausiating voice, in French and English will annoy you hugely while you enter. You'll probably be able to recite the lines upon entry, and not just in English!About the park, I feel over the years it has been slowly let to become just a generally tacky place, and what I find interesting is that this year it's the 'Twenty year celebrations', and part of me wonders if some of the places haven't been seen to since 1992! The rides, however are actually quite good and still cater for all of the age groups, for example children can still live out dreams in 'Fantasyland', whether they are male or female, or the boys can pretend they're still a cowboy in the 'Wild Wild West', in 'Frontierland', yee haw. These are just to name a few of the fantasies that can be lived out by your children, but it comes at a price..Example, take the image that I have just shown you, go on imagine it, you have my permission. Okay, now add lots of people. No no, more than that. Nope, still more than that! Okay if you need an idea, just add everyone who visits Oxford Street, Westfield London West and Westfield Stratford, on a Saturday, in the school holidays. Bingo! You've got enough people now in this vision. Make sure you've got enough crying babies, toddlers, screaming parents and arguments galore, add a hot Summer's day if you wish and your image is complete. Serve with a garnish of stress. This, dear reader is how crowded the place gets. I can understand why though, but there are limits, and I fear that this is the limit. The sheer volume of people on the site at one time can be bordering among the dangerous, an example of this being every five seconds, you are bound to hit another family and be saying 'Sorry' in about seven different languages. If you have small children also, well this can be made even worse, as some people I saw in the park completely disregard anyone, and your child, or children for that matter stand a high risk of ending up in the back of an ambulance after 'Mr. I don't care about anyone within a 100m radius of me' knocks into you, or your child, causing distress and injury. Getting onto any ride, even past ten 'o' clock is misery served on ice. What is even worse is the fact that some people have the cheek to push past you in the queues! This happened to me, as first hand experience and so I was in a battle for one space against four other people, in a queue. How sad it is. The average queue time for any ride after about an hour after opening is 60 minutes plus, sometimes even up to 90. So if you like queuing, by all means get down to Disneyland now! However, if you don't like most people..I want to move on now to the prices of some things once you're inside the park. To sum it up in a sentence, once you're in the park, you are essentially prisoner, at mercy to the owners of Disneyland. Bring half the contents of your bank account, because 98% of the time you'll be using it all up. Food there is a joke, to say the least. Unless you want to have a small bite and dare to venture into some of the 'themed' places Disneyland offer internally, you're going to be stung. Badly. A main meal? I know some places in London where you can get a good quality meal for   15 a head, sometimes more sometimes less dependent what you get, but all with plenty of food so you don't go home hungry. At Disneyland? Ahem. Just for a main meal, 20 euros minimum. Or if you look around and not eat as much, 10 and 14 euros as a bracket. You would expect the quality to be great wouldn't you considering the price? Think again. I forked out 14 euros for a pizza meal, of which promised me a four cheese pizza, a side salad, tiramisu and a drink. Anyone with the least of distingushed pallets could tell you that the pizza was probably made out of only two cheeses. And the quality of the rest of the food is just, to be frank dire for what one expects for the money. At least the tiramisu cheered me up a bit. 'Own some of the magic!' I hear Disney cry, now. What they don't mention is that to own 'some of the magic', you need to fork out pathetic amounts of money to actually obtain it. Items of clothing, if you expect to go there to buy some new clothes and bring not much else, you're going to be strutting around in your birthday suit, unless you have a golden credit card. A themed T Shirt, for example costed 35 euros. Excuse me? I could eat out with 'Mon amour' for cheaper! If I had one. Even a balloon with Mickey or Minnie Mouse on it costs 7.50 euros. How disgusting is that when you as an adult will fully know that the balloons probably get made for about seven cents! It's just sad though, I feel personally that Disney need to charge so much for everything once you're inside the park and it is a true disgrace.Lastly the parades, of which run nightly. Most nights, or even every night there is one parade at 7pm, of which features the main characters that Mr. Disney created many years ago, and also the masterminds of today. Be severely warned. I arranged to meet my mum and little sister near to the entrance of the park about ten minutes before the parade begun, as they had gone home for the afternoon and I wanted to sieze the opportunity to, hopefully be impressed by Disneyland that afternoon. I had to get back from one side of the park to the other to do so and as one expects, the journey shouldn't be too bad, right? Wrong. The time came around when I was to meet with my mum and sister, only to be met by a brick wall of, what felt like two thousand people, sealing off any exit point to attempt to get to my parents. I was lucky though, I got through in the end and this was for two reasons;1. I live near London, and I often spend a lot of time on the tube, meaning I'm used to the general commute and running through places at speed.2. I was on my own at that point.If I wasn't on my own, I wouldn't have made it back to my mum, purely because it would have been impossible circumnavigating a tide of stressed parents with small children, simple. Once I got back to my loving family, I was greeted with a sight where people had been sitting, or standing right against the kerb to get the best view of the men and women in funny costumes, of which was just amazing to see. Amazing for Disney, obviously as they are rolling in the money, amazing for me and my sister as she couldn't see anything, just a sea of legs and shorts. In theory this idea could work though of having so many people, and work quite well, but the staff just got it all wrong, encouraging people to stand up, and actually arguing with them if they didn't stand. It doesn't take a genius to work out that when you have that volume of people you can't have the first two rows of people standing! Pathetic. I felt the need to lift my sister onto my shoulders as I love her very much, like a brother should so that she could see everything, and she got the enjoyment out of it that she deserved. The sad fact is though is that they only had one parade on a day, at 7pm. I find this a bit sad as you should 'give something for the fans that paid to get in', and do more parades a day, please? For what you get, however if you do decide to fork out the money to come here it just doesn't step up to the mark. My sister was just overwhelmed by the amount of people that were in the park at one time, and in fact it was too much for her, and I just suspect some other young children would find the whole attraction too much. If you want to own some of the cheaply made magic that'll cost you 25 euros and last about a week, then go on. If you want to overpay for some cheap and nasty food where you're NOT allowed to have a picnic once inside the park, then go on. If you want a day where you'll be constantly bumped into, knocked out of the way or even onto the ground, where you're surrounded by children having tantrums because they can't have the candy floss which costs 4 euros, and then wait in a queue for a ride for 90 minutes that lasts 90 seconds, then go on! UK attractions such as 'Thorpe Park' and 'Alton Towers' have really overtaken Disneyland over the last five years, and unfortunately Disneyland has been left in the dust, coughing and spluttering. Be warned.",-1
"I find this review very hard to write. I am 50 years old and have, my entire life, visited Disneyland a minimum of twice a year. Growing up we weren't very wealthy but my father loved this place and what Walt Disney stood for SO MUCH that he brought us to the park all the time. It has been such a magical place for me and ultimately for my children (now aged 21   26). We have been pass holders before passes were so affordable and easy to acquire. I know that  once upon a time  Disneyland didn't have competition, but now people have so many attractions to choose from that Disneyland may no longer be first choice.In the past year, I have noticed a great change in Disneyland. The first thing is how busy it is on almost any day of the year. Due to the annual passes, many can come everyday if they choose to. I have been at the park during a school week and the park is filled with Mom's and their toddlers. They use the park as a place to entertain their kids and then around 3:30 all heck breaks lose when parents of tweens and teenagers drop their kids off at the main entrance and drive off to have a peaceful evening. Translation for the adult Disneyland enthusiast is a crowded park with long lines 90% of the time. It has become impossible to ride a substantial amount of rides in one day. We have averaged 5 6 rides PERIOD.I feel that this enslaught of unattended teenagers has caused the  cast members  of Disneyland to also lose their cool. With each subsequent visit I find more and more not friendly cast members (Disneyland employees are referred to as Cast Members, not employees). Our last visit was my breaking point, when we were accosted by a front gate cast member and then her Lead Cast Member (supervisor) was just as nasty as her. Very unprofessional behavior for any park, absolutely unheard of from Disneyland, or is it? When a supervisor supports the nasty behavior from their employee I then know that this issue goes straight to the top. There is a managing employee that has told them whether directly or indirectly that this behavior is allowable. VERY unacceptable for my family and I. At this point my husband was demanding I have his annual pass cancelled and my 21year old son wanted to do the same with his own pass. This is how bad the situation was.The last major complaint I have is their food quality and service. I used to be excited that I would get to graze all day in the park. This is no longer the case. The food is horrific, badly made, badly kept fresh and absolutely horrible temperatures. I find that the food in not only tasteless but I am sure can be dangerous to our health. I know you are asking where are the health inspectors, think about this. A health inspector will have to come in through a secured entrance where they will announce their intent. A quick radio call to lead supervisors gets the park on alert immediately and things are put in place prior to the inspector having a chance to come to one of the food vendors. This last trip we ate at the Taste Pilot's Grill, which is located in the California Adventure Park near the Soaring over California ride. You can read my review of that restaurant next. : ) Let's keep it short the food was horrendous. Cold cheaply made and they charged an arm and a leg. The service was nothing to get excited about either. No wonder we found seats in the patio area, people already knew to avoid this place.So what to do? Disney will eventually realize that the peoplel who actually spend money at Disneyland are no longer visiting, or when we do visit we keep it short and sweet. We do our shopping and eating away from the park. I know that my family of 10 (whose passes I pay for) will not be rushing to visit anytime soon. I am really hoping that Disneyland comes to it's senses and realizes just because the park is busting at the seams everyday may not be the wisest business decision when it comes to money. And that if they do not pick up their employee training and create happy cast members again, that the customers coming to the park will also start behaving in an angry nasty manner. I know we left for the first time ever before closing because of our experience with the nasty gate agent. We left because we could no longer be nice, the agent set our tone for us.I really hope changes are affected, I miss the enchancted kingdom as it once was.",-1
"If you have small children who never been to theme park and you accidentally found 500 EUR and you want to spent it in old fashioned park, then enjoy! Otherwise go to any water park or theme park close to your house, buy a few Mickey and Elsa clothes from ebay and you will have better experience.Most of the attractions were built 15 years ago and nothing changed since. One third of attractions was out of order because of wind, rain or just broken. For other smaller attractions (such simple carousel or car driving range) you will wait  just  20 minutes. For the bigger ones you have to wait 60 80 minutes in a queue. That is terrible and even waiting 20 minutes with 3 years kid for 1 minute ride ... not worth the 200 EUR entrance fee for the family.It was a huge disappointment for us. Even the simple fun like Disney characters in costumes which you would expect to be on every corner are rare to meet. They appear few times a day and there is another 30 minutes queue to get a hug from Mickey! How expensive could be to buy ten costumes of Mickey and hire ten people to walk among visitors?The prices of Disney merchandising and refreshments are enormous. Make yourself a baguette with ham and you will safe tens of euro.",-1
"Too much money, too many people at all times of the year. Having a day where you can get on the rides quickly is like spotting a unicorn; never happens. I get that they do what Disney does better than anybody else, and yes, your kids should experience it at least once ( over a two day period, because you will NEVER get on everything in one day, due to the long lines). My gripe is the every increasing entrance fee, exorbitant prices for mediocre food and the fact that I can't get to my car if I want to. Not easily, not on my own. I have to wait for a tram to take me to the hinterlands, whether it's in the structure or an outlying lot. My Disney days are done, my kids are over it too, they prefer Knotts and their next step will be Magic Mountain. ",-1
"OBJECTIVE REVIEW FROM ANNUAL PASS HOLDER   TOP TIPS: PLEASE READWe were annual pass holders for this park for a few consecutive years because we live close by, so my review is based on many visits. We are no longer frequent visitors mainly because of the following three reasons:1) the park is relatively small compared to the USA with fewer attractions, yet the park welcomes many visitors daily and wait times can be very long during school holidays (most summer, December) and weekends with average waits 25 90 minutes for most attractions. The worst rides are always Thunder Mountain and the Nemo coaster. It's difficult to find days that are quiet (usually limited to some wintry week days in Jan Feb)2) often the waiting lines are poorly managed and it is not unusual for parallel lines to move at significantly different speeds. Picking the right one requires some luck. This in combination with sometimes rude visitors cutting lines, pushing etc, has often caused us much frustration. 3) the worst thing is many many people smoking in the park, everywhere, all the time. There are constantly clouds of tobacco smoke drifting across your walking path. Smoking is not allowed in lines, but it's not really enforced. Just recently, I had a big argument with a visitor who flatly refused to put out their cigarette in a line, among children. On another occasion, I had to alert management of a group of teenage girls smoking marihuana in a line. I blame management for this as there should be a blanket ban that is continuously enforced, with widespread signs. Based on that, I feel the park deserves no more than one star, but my review has to stay objective and there are certainly also some good points about the park (beautifully landscaped, beautiful Cinderella castle, Nemo coaster)TOP TIPS:1) bear in mind the above points, so you are prepared. If possible, best to avoid visiting around any school holidays, the summer and weekends2) regardless, arrive either very early or arrive late to leave late during extended opening hours (weekends, summers). Waiting times drop off significantly a few hours before late closing hours as people get tired. Even better to split the day in two or visit 1 2 days several days. It's not an endurance race. Kids (and adults) get tired and cranky3) Walt Disney Studio's are fairly small but have some good attractions (Tower of Terror, Lilo & Stitch show, Nemo Coaster, Playhouse Disney show, Toystory land)4) get a fast pass as soon as you arrive (Thundermountain is a good bet). You can only get a fast pass for another attraction after the time has lapsed on the first one. No fast passes at Studio's.5) waiting time for the Nemo coaster at Walt Disney's studio's are usually long all day long, there is little point in postponing the wait. It's a very nice ride, worth the wait. Probably best for first thing in the morning6) quality of the food is not great and expensive. Best bets are the Hakuma Matata (fast food) or Blue Lagoon (table service, expensive). 7) if you are tired of the lines, try the slow train ride around the park, the steam boat, Adventure Island. Also, Phantom Manor's waiting times are also usually reasonable.",-1
"The park is dated and in need of a thorough overhaul. It is more French than I expected, in a weird way   things like Star Wars C3PO speaking French! Armageddon is useless unless you speak French. If you get the choice go to Florida. If you must go to Paris I hope his helps :Buy your tickets in the UK before you leave from www.seetickets.com   we paid   50 per person (gate price is    90).Studio park is better than the main park however do the shows early   despite the park being open until 11pm the last stunt show is at 4pm for example. Restaurants also close early   by 7pm we struggled to find somewhere to eat.Use the Fast Pass system   allows you to book a time slot on rides then come back at the specified time so you can go off and do other things instead of queuing.Avoid the All You Can Eat buffet restaurants   full of screaming kids running around and their parents exercising no control (in fact most of them look like they avoid exercise entirely).Get a map (they are free at the entrance)   the signs in the park are hopeless.If you are staying in Paris you can get on the Metro (their version of the London Underground) at any station and get a train right into Disneyland Park. About    30 each way.",-1
"In LA for a few days and thought what could be better than a visit to Disneyland? As it turned out, ANYTHING. We went on a Thursday and we couldn't believe the crowds. This wasn't helped when there were so many strollers in the park. I guess Disney must have shares in a stroller manufacturer. The queues everywhere were horrific. We were in the queue for splash mountain and it broke down. We did get on it later and it broke down while we were on the ride. We went back later and it was broken again. The Pinocchio ride broke down so we couldn't go in. The Alien boasters broke down as we queues. Surprised we didn't have a breakdown. We've been to Orlando a few times and it was great. We didn't think the French would pull it off in Paris, but they did. This is the worst park we've been to. If you can't get to any of the other parks then visit here. But you have been warned. Waste of money.",-1
"It's no secret that a visit here doesn't come cheap but Disney take the term rip off to a whole new level. You get some idea of what is to come when you book the tickets online and discover that the Disney definition of an adult is a 12 year old. However, having paid    229 for tickets for 3 adults (my 13 year old being an adult according to Disney) and 1 child (   300 at the gate so if you have to go then definitely book in advance) it came as an unpleasant surprise to be charged an additional    15 for parking. Once inside, the overcharging continues   e.g. almost    3 for a small bottle of coke or water.However, none of this is that unexpected but what we didn't expect were the length of the queues for most of the rides. We queued for 50 minutes to an hour for 2 pretty average rides which once you are on them lasted less than a minute. Some of the queues for the popular rides were 70 minutes. There is a fast pass option but it is of very limited use and we only managed to use it once. We then queued for over 30 minutes for Phantom Manor and then spent another 20 minutes stuck in the lift which traumatised my daughter and ruined the rest of the day as she was reluctant to go on any of the other rides. The operator seemed to have no idea of what was going on and when questioned merely responded with  technical problem . The apology when we were eventually released was very token.I have honestly had much better days out at Thorpe Park and Chessington World of Adventures at a fraction of the cost. We emailed Disney with our complaint when we returned home and received an automated response promising that thay would contact us  very soon . More than 2 weeks later we have still not heard from them.",-1
"It was always magical and enchanting but waiting for longer than 2  hours for some rides with NO protection for the sun is not. There is no protection from the sun anywhere, no shaded places, no where to sit under an umbrella or similar. In fact, no were to sit and rest, period. Food and drinks (very little of it) is awfully expensive (and not good) and you are not permitted to bring your own. Disneyland is behind times; there are NO places to recharge your phone or devices anywhere even though the map shows a single location but when you get there you are not allowed to enter or charge. If you find an outlet somewhere to plug in by a miracle, staff barks at you and kicks you out! Totally behind times and NOT an  entertainment  park anymore. Just a money sucking, wasted time in line, no were to sit park! So different from before and so behind times and comfort for the public! We are truly disappointed! This will be our last visit !!",-1
"Disneyland should be  Welcoming ,  HAPPY ,  CHEERFUL , etc...  well, unfortunately not for Paris!!  The staff where rude and hardly speak the international language   ENGLISH!!  Rides were awesome but as usual long queues..",-1
"Disney afficiadios   worse Disney in the world by far. Shabby and grotty. Most Staff indifferent and poorly kitted out, some tried to bring the Disney Magic but they were fighting a battle. Food choice poor. Disney 'stuff' choice poor. I was prepared to spend serious cash but they didn't seem to want my money. Lots of rides and attractions closed. Most other rides (even cinderellas castle) were shut while we were in line due to 'technical difficulties)   my son was quite happy on buzz because we were stopped for so long he maxed out. Another ride had us waiting for over a hour before the line was dispersed with fast passes. It has been our mission for the past 10 years to visit ever Disney and I am so glad this was the last one because I would never have gone to another. Disney needs to throw some serious cash at his place. Spruce it up. And Disney really need to spend considerable effort in staff training. Truly un magical experience ",-1
"We took my 2 small grandkids (ages 6 and 3) to the Happiest Place on Earth for New Year's to enjoy the rides. Got there early and got our 2 strollers, so everyone would make it to fireworks. The first few hours were great hopping on and off rides. By afternoon the place was crowded    okay that's normal. Never could get a place to see the parades    too many people. Late afternoon, you could barely move because they roped off and shut the streets while installing bands. (Hum, I thought this place was about the rides but we stood patiently waiting trying to get across the streets and down sidewalks like the other 85,000  people.) Early evening, people are now body to body against the ropes, rails, and walls. People were trying to push through the crowds and were falling over our strollers against my grandkids. People were angry at being stopped and just being forced to stand in one spot while thousands of others crowded in behind them. Adults were vying on the streets for the best spot to see the NO NAME bands. By 8 p.m. they had closed down the rides because no one could tell where the normally long lines ended or began because every available area had people standing and waiting ... waiting for what? They closed the rides so there was nothing to do but listen to bands    excuse me Disneyland    we didn't go there so we could take our toddlers to a Night Club atmosphere!!! We paid almost $600 for one day, so we could ride the rides, see the parades, and watch fireworks. My grandchildren only saw the backs of the legs of the people standing in the crowd in front of them who were at a dead halt hoping to see the bands. It took us 2 hours to make it from the Castle down Main Street to the gate. If there had been any kind of emergency, we would all have been crushed by people trying to get out. You expect crowds at Disneyland if you've ever gone there before. I've worked in security and crowd control for years, and believe Disneyland did not have adequate crowd control plans or people to handle such an event. If they repeat this next year, they can advertise Disney's new event and call it a  Frightmare on Main Street !!!!",-1
Steer clear of this overpriced overated dump.Just returned (31 08 2010)from our 3 day trip.Stayed at the Santa fe and aquired an upset stomach from there food and insomnia from there very pokey rooms that offer the comfort of a world war 2 bunker.The place itself is an absolute dump in need of an upgrade.There is nothing for the kids to do what so ever unless you count the over priced games room.The one tv channel they had in english never worked.Tried to get on the shuttle only to be crushed in the mad stampede when it eventually stops so decided to walk.The park itself has no idea what time it is meant to stay open so they make it up as the go along........one day its 11pm and the next its 7pm.Shows are cancelled without notice and if you can get on an attraction its an absolute miracle.Rides constantly break down and the queues just get longer and longer and you just get so frustrated you decide to leave the park.OH AND THE REALLY GOOD BIT YOU NEED TO KNOW IS THAT IF YOU HAVE CHILDREN UNDER 7 YEARS OF AGE THERE IS NOTHING THEY CAN GO ON SO DONT BRING THEM......P.s. if you want to eat there then expect to pay 20 euros (about   17)per person minimum at any restaurant and also the same for a soft toy.,-1
"We had organized the visit quite well. Parking was easy. Getting to the Park was very easy as well. The rest of the day was unfortunately disappointing. There were thousands of people everywhere. Waiting times for rides and things to do was in excess of 45 minutes. With young kids that is a long time to wait around for 2 minutes of fun.Walking around the park was very trying to say the least. We went to both parks and the Movie Park was pointless. Still more people and I waited 20 minutes to purchase two drinks at a vendor. Sorry to say, I just do not get it. There were no Disney character's to see or meet, limited spots for lunch, ques everywhere and really nothing to see.My three boys agree with me. It was a waste of money. I understand that we went at peak season but really the visit was our low point in our 2 month Europe visit.",-1
"Visited July 2013 with my 25 year old daughter, and two grand daughters. 5 and 2. For a 2 day park hopper was $206 each. The 2 year old was free, To charge that much for 2 days and then have to wait in lines to do anything for hours is not good. To top it off anything you buiy there is so over priced. $10 for a beer, Water $5, anything to eat at one of the cafes was appox. $15 per plate. They charge you $18 for a stroller rental, WOW, you would think that since the tickets cost so m,uch and you reallty don't go on many rides because the wait is just to long that they would give the strollers a much cheaper rental. Was not impressed with anything there, the kids like it but for the parents its almost unaffordable. We visited Knotts Berry Farm one day and it was on $66 per son, 2 year old free however the things for the kids to do was way better and the line wait for maybe 15 minutes, If you think about it by the time you pay to get to get there, the hotel charge, food and getting into the parks cost more than if we booked a vacation in a resort somewhere like Mexico just about anywhere else. Never would I do that again",-1
"We stayed at the Disneyland hotel. Very convenient to get to the parks from there. The parks were underwhelming. Once you have been to disneyworld and Disneyland Paris is a letdown. The rides are different, and not as exciting. Price for the tickets is excessive as are the fast passes. Unless this is a Disney bucket list thing for you, don   t bother. ",-1
"I went here twice.Once I went at late August, the weather was perfect. I don't mind trying all the rides and queuing for them.Then I went in March, the weather was biting cold. Walking to and from attractions is a painful chore.In any weather, I can say that there's only 6 attractions that is worthwhile for adults. And in 8 hour streak, the lines can be so bad that I get only one ride in each of those attractions.I've dine inside and can say that I regret that decision. With the same money I've paid per person, I could've added another 5 star restaurant in the city to enjoy.",-1
"Disneyland has become a money mongral. You get searched on your way in and are not allowed to bring in food or drinks. Then they charge you $3.00 for a Dasani water (the kind you pay a dollar for in the store. Plan on spending at least $10.00 per meal per person if you eat in the park, and losing at least an hour going to your car or out of the park each time you eat. Lines were at least an hour for the good rides so all in all you pay $75 to get in and get to ride maybe 6 rides if you utlize the fast passes.Money Money Money  and souvaniers...Please do yourself a favor and go to Wal Mart for the clothing.Basically, you are paying for the  privilage  of seeing a  must see before you die  place. I will never go there again. Also, too see the whole park, you need more than 3 days.",-1
"It is August holidays after all, so we were expecting the worst, but were still surprised at how poor the whole experience was.    200 for 2 adults and 1 child for 1 day pass to 1 park.    50 for the return journey by train. We managed 8 rides in 12 hours. A total of approx 25? mins actually on rides. Should we have to pay more for fast passes who also had to queue? This wasn't on the adverts.. Ok, a couple of rides were good, but so short. Food, drink, treats   everything very overpriced for a captive audience. If you have young children of a certain age, they will like the scenery, but how can queuing for hours on every ride be enjoyable? Some restaurants closed at 6... Er, tea time? Fireworks at 11pm? Judging by how packed the train was with glum and tired faces, they couldn't wait that long either. We remarked that we saw many more tired and bored or frustrated looking faces than happy ones. Clearly all about the money, to the point that we felt mocked and rather stupid for going. Luckily several fantastic days in Paris meant this was the only bad day of our holiday. Take my advice and think of all the other wonderful things to do before you go and don't learn the hard way like we did.",-1
"Had a 5 day holiday here and personally I would have given it 1 star but rest of family said two. Stayed in a Disney hotel which was clean and basically a place to sleep. The park itself had quite a few rides not on from space mountain, nautilas, merry go round, flying carpets, etc. However this alone was not the only problem. The queuing system at this park is atrocious. All systems which involve queuing will have issues but the method at this park is very bad. Some rides have fast pass but a lot of the time you couldn't get them because the machines were off. And of those rides that didn't have fast pass people still managed to queue jump as they used what is meant to be a disabled facility to do so. Disney has also issued passes to  cast  which was a big gripe, from the guy and his daughter riding autoptia 4 times alone while we were in the queue, to the 2 women who thought that because they had such a pass to queue jump at the ice cream counter where not only had everyone queued for over half an hour but that they found it acceptable to do so to a child of about 7 in front of us with no feeling of embarrassment. I first became aware of these cards when a family of 4 jumped the queue at the best hot dog place if you know how long you have to wait there to get to the front to be usurped by someone saying they have a disabled card when its a cast card and that they are as healthy as anything it's frustrating to say the least, I don't disagree with the disabled part of it,because I think that's great that they accommodate this,it's the misuse of this system which is extremely prevelant at this park that I object to because this causes the queuing of everyone else to be longer than necessary, and having to view it so blatantly is what upsets the paying customer. Furthermore we didn't use it but feel for those wishing to visit princess pavilion as you have to queue for reservations to see them, as hotel guests we were in the park early but if you are visiting for the day the chances of getting one are unlikely as by 11 there always seemed to be none left. There were other things that let this park down but the queuing was the main problem. The parade and fireworks display were about the best thing and most staff were pleasantpleasant, however when they speak not only in French but in other languages many seem to think that they have to do it in as little time as possible that you have no idea what they have said. All in all family agreed that they wouldn't go back",-1
"Having been to Disney elsewhere I knew what to expect but was disappointed nonetheless. There are only four good rides at the park and on the day we went two of them were closed for reconstruction. That really isn't fair, only one should be done at a time considering the costs involved for tickets and travel. It also had the knock on effect that the lines were extra long.The food choices are truly awful. An embarrassment for France. Again, big lines, slow service and the prices just ridiculous.    3.69 for a small bottle of water   and that's the cheapest thing you can buy. At their steak restaurant (which we did not go to but I looked at the menu and read reviews of) the prices were similar to a fine restaurant in Paris. And yet you would get the  thrill  of bad service and overpriced mundane food. Overall the day was OK, the sun was shining and youngest child enjoyed it. I would suggest that people try the Asterix park instead.",-1
"To be fair, my children loved the park as we tended two go early morning and late afternoon while during the midday we stayed at the Disneyland hotel.Everything is totally overcrowded and queuing just goes on and on everywhere.Food and drinks are totally over the limit. Not only is the entrance for a day 300     for two adults and two children but it is very easy to spend an additional 200      on food if you want at least a descent meal. Being to Disneyworld Orlando I felt this was a totally different experience. I found that Paris can not sell you the american dream.",-1
"Spent the best part of Saturday at Disneyland and left feeling very disappointed. It seems for every ride, there are at least five restaurants or shops. It's hard not to feel you're walking through a massive money racquet.An awful lot of the attractions were closed for refurbishment, which meant the queues for the remaining ones were ridiculous. A forty minute queue just for the teacups is not fun.After 40 minutes waiting in line for Thunder Mountain, the queue started moving rapidly. We were being shepherded to the exit with a member of staff saying  You all have to leave . We assumed a technical fault was to blame, but staff were not forthcoming with any sort of explanation.We only got to go on four rides all day due to the extreme waiting times and they were largely not worth the wait.Food mediocre and overpriced, but this was expected. The park was annoying to navigate, with little signage and several blocked paths due to refurbishment.Characters were at specific photo points and again, queues were ridiculously long. We couldn't understand why some of the staff standing round chatting to each other couldn't have thrown on another costume and just stayed away from their counterpart to let children and big kids have more of an opportunity to meet and greet.A frustrating day all in all, lacking in any of the Disney Magic we had hoped for. I would recommend Portaventura over Disneyland a thousand times over.",-1
"We went on a Monday. There are a lot of people, even tough it   s not June yet. The wait on most rides was about 30 minutes. We did get 2 fast pass. Everything is expensive! You will need to come with a lot of money, or big credit card! A bag of cotton candy is $4.75, if you get pink. It is $5.25 otherwise. A turkey leg is over $12. The merchandise is expensive also! A sweet shirt is $50 to $65, depending on if it has a zipper or not. The magnets are about $10. The rides are fun, and you do have somewhat of a good time; however, you won   t want to go back! The park in Orlando is much bigger. They had fireworks here at 9:30, but it only lasted about 7 minutes. It lasted about 30 minuets in Orlando. They were taking your bench away, so they could make reserved seating for special guests that paid them more money! This was to view the fireworks. This is a horrible thing to do! They should have moved these benches before the park opened, rather than pull them out from under us! It would be better yet if they did not reserve seats for groups paying extra! They did this for the parade also. Shame on Disney for doing this! We have a 2 day ticket, so I guess we have to go back. I have not heard much good about the California Park, too many rides broke down. This will be our last time to Disneyland, as Disney World is much better, except for the lack of benches in Florida. We can   t recommend Disneyland!",-1
"Embarrassed for Mr. Walt Disney. The park was created in 2005. Disney had a blank slate to create a world class park. Instead they created an embarrassing tourist trap, that offered an uninspiring place to capture your money only. If Walt was alive he would have fired the person in charge of new park development.... Don't waste your time and don't waste your money at this park. No wonder The Hong Kong park is losing millions of $$ each year..now they have finally decided to invest big money staring in 2019 to rehab this place.. we live in Los Angeles and have been to Disneyland many many times..and are very proud of the park..but HK big joke",-1
Some sort of accurate indication of wait time is needed. 45 to 60 minutes is too long for what turns out to be a 3 to 5 minute ride. It needs more stuff you can see from the outside and staff need a better attitude,-1
"It's okay, it's small, are the rides shorter cause they feel shorter ?  I wunder if Shanghai Disney is a better day out .",-1
"I was extremely disappointed in the Disney experience which is NOTHING like the US. After waiting in line for over an hour, the cashier experienced 'technical difficulties' and we were made to queue in another line. I was accused of cutting the line and a man got physical with my 14 year old son. I then encountered more 'technical difficulties' when the restaurant I waited in line for also experienced technical difficulties and we were turned away. I then had to go to another park for lunch. At Hiperion i was told that out of 3 hamburger choices, none of them could be ordered with no cheese. My son is lactose intolerant and they finally agreed to give me a chicken sandwich with no cheese...it had cheese!We then tried getting onto Armageddon, Tower of Terror and two other rides, which all experienced  technical experiences !! We were only able to go on one ride during the entire day. NEVER AGAIN.And there were no friendly faces, no explanations and no apologies. We will never return and I truly do not recommend you invest in this experience.",-1
"Not enough activities for adults and children and too much people with important waiting lines (sometimes more than 1h30..)Finally you do maybe 15 minutes of pure attraction for 6 full hours of waiting time...That's a poor ratio for fun and you finish the day more tired and stressed and happy to go home.It's maybe better out of summer, i don't know, but in summer, don't go !",-1
"Top attractions Matterhorn, Railroad, Riverboat and several others are closed for refurbishment. They need it, as they keep stopping. Evacuation procedures are awful, needing more than a half hour to get people off a stopped ride. They don't advise about the closed rides before you buy a ticket, but that is part of the Disney culture: grab as much money as they can. There are lots of other people who will keep the lineups full. You need lots of patience and ways to entertain kids in hour long lineups.",-1
"this was our 3rd Disney park. First in LA second in Hong Kong and this one. Sorry but it stats at the beginning to be a rip off. I think Disney should use some case study which have been done of the Hong Kong Disney park, to learn how to look after customers. Long waiting line to pay entrance so understaffed or Planed to make all Waite 2 hrs. or more to get in. I think its Organized this way to streamline customers and make more money as its all about money and not about service in Paris Disney. Once you are in and like to look at The princesses to get some pictures for your children you line up to get Ticket at 1 pm and they give your ticket for 8.20 PM to go in to the Princess pavilion so 7 hrs. later. HA HA and its a surprise of the only 1 princes you will see! so to you think children age 4 to 10 will wait 7 hrs. ??? overall associates and customized artist should get some training in US and Hong Kong on genuine personal interaction with children as it was completely missing. many people smoke everywhere and this in a children them park? I am smoker but .......I can only recommend anybody if you like to see Disneyland go to other countries as Paris Disney is waist of money.",-1
"First, this is the only review I have ever written  I have noticed that Disneyland has felt less and less personal the past few times we have gone (we are southern Cal. residents). It seems that what was once a well oiled machine, has become very robotic and cold (not to mention $$$$$). Number one: Beware of the guy at the nearby Marriott (an employee of Disney) who sells the tickets to Disneyland. We had three families all staying there to avoid morning traffic as we were to meet an entire kindergarten class the next morning. We all bought our tickets at different times, however when we met up for dinner, we had all been sold three day tickets, and we were all baffled at how masterful the guy was at talking us up before we knew it. Had it only happened to one of us, you could say it was just one of us being gullible, but all three of us? Number two: Part of the scam was that we (each) asked if it was reasonable to go to the California Adventure for the light show (since we had a night to fill). Without any mention of anything extra needed, we were sold these three day things so we could view the show. He told us the time of the show, but neglected to tell us that a fast pass is required (and those are gone by mid morning usually)  So, we all have our $$$ 3Day passes, and keep our 10 very young children up late by going to a very loud restaurant on Disney Way (all restaurants had long waits). Then, we go into the Disney Adventure to see the light show, and we just keep getting ushered down a street by  cast members  with flashlights...We think we are being ushered to the show, but after tremendous amounts of walking with now very tired children, we figure out (by asking one of the wavers on) that we can't see the show without a Fast Pass (we did not know what that was). Even though there was PLENTY of room behind a rope surrounding the edges of the street, we were not allowed to either go inside the rope to watch or even stop where we were standing. I don't know if you can imagine, but three Moms and ten tiny children at 9:30PM walking endlessly, and being told they cannot stand for a moment. One Mom stood for a minute with her child to get a glimpse, and security was called. When we promised not to stand, the followed us from behind a little, making sure we kept moving. Needless to say, we were all furious that were sold 3 Day passes only to miss the whole reason we bough them  A pure scam. Number three: Disney Customer Relations: After all this, I at least wanted my money back for the night we just walked and were not allowed to do anything in the Park. The customer service was the worst I have ever encountered. Instead of acting sympathetic, they were cynical and argumentative. The person I spoke with loved to talk, and would give long explanations for why they actually did nothing wrong. After two separate conversation, and then asking for a supervisor, I again found the same defensive and unhelpful, unaccommodating attitude. It was as though they had memorized scripts. It was a very big disappointment to us all.",-1
"The way they run this is a joke! I took my kids here to get pictures with the princess so we stood in line for our turn. As we where waiting patiently for our turn about 20 little girls dressed like there favorite princess cut in the front of the line. I asked the employee, AKA Cast Member why was they aloud to cut in the line like that, and he said girls dressed like princesses get to go threw the line to have there pictures with the princesses first. How is that fare??? Is this what Disneyland has came to, is letting people cut in line and it's ok, they promote that! Wow!!! So They dress like the theme of the attraction and it's ok to take cuts, so I guess if I want to cut in line for the Haunted Mansion all I have to do is dress like a ghost, or Space Mountain dress like an Astronaut, or a cowboy for Big Thunder Mountain ect., and that's totally ok??? We will never stand in the line for Princess Fantasy Faire again!!!",-1
"We have been to DisneyWorld in Florida and Disneyland in Paris. We knew that the Anaheim park is the oldest and one of the smaller ones, but we still expected it to have Disney magic but we were disappointed. There were no parades and very few Disney characters around   one of the highlights of Disney with small children. The queues to see the characters were huge   1 and a half hours for Rapunzel and similar for the other Disney princesses (you were guaranteed to see 3 but not which 3 they would be). I guess the queues were so long because there was no opportunity to see the characters in a parade.The tickets were also the most expensive of the 3 parks we've visited. If you have small children and are thinking of travelling to California specifically to go to Disneyland, don't   go to Florida instead! We will be going back to California but we won't bother with Anaheim again.",-1
"we had a eurodisney holiday booked for me, my husband and 3 year old. it was cancelled due to weather. we were booked with this so called company. when we called they said we would get a refund within 5   10 days... never got it, called again and once again told the same and suprise suprise they still have not refunded us and are now not answering their phones or replying to emails, we are now out of pocket of 110 euros. Please do not use this pathetic so called company.",-1
Honestly maybe i'm just not a Disney fan. The small world ride low key creeped me out. The food was a tad bit over priced and tasted like microwave food.,-1
"I  want   to say that I love Disneyland. That it was the best place to go. That my kids loved it. We saw everything. Got on the rides and truly enjoyed ourselves. But I cannot say any of that.We went 5 years ago when our kids were babies 1 and 3. We waited almost 5 years and were told that we have to go during Christmas.  You have to see the fireworks and snow!  Well....$1,400.00 later with alot of planning and budgeting....the fireworks were cancelled. So was the snow. If you can actually get to an employee...they told us very different stories about why. We still do not know why. We were so dissapointed. Sadly, I believe our days are up: ( It was INSANE! Some people said on here to get there early, get Fastpasses, get in line early, have a  plan! . I Sooooo hear you. We did this ONLY because we booked it already and paid, and then were told last minute that we were in for pure chaos and crowds. I tell you, we did lots of rides, did the Fast passes, got there early, but our kids hated it! So did we! I never plan to have to  plan  my vacation like that again. I only did it because of the money we spent, but it was crazy, long lines, crazy people, you couldn't see anything....just exhausting and tiring : (We could not wait to get back to our hotel and THAT is sad. We were there to see Disneyland and ALL we wanted to do was get the heck out of there!!",-1
"This is an overall impression of the two parks and one hotel.We went to the park with our 8 years old daughter on last weekend (March, 10 12th, thinking it's low season) and we came to the conclusion: never again. Europapark is a much better experience.We took the hotel Cheyenne with park tickets formula at 782     for the two nights (  flight).You get a time slot for having breakfast (for us 9:30), nobody answer the reservation phone for the dinner, and buffet food quality is very low (breakfast and dinner).The room was ok (good).Back to the park: the easy pass (entrance at 8h, before official one at 10h) is a joke. Only three activities are open, of which one is under maintenance.Our daughter wanted to do the big thunder mountain. So we waited with hundreds of peoples at the entrance of Frontierland until it opened at 10h, we waited again almost an hour in raw, and just before we could take it, it had a technical problem and they sent every body out! We got a fast pass but valid only for this activity. Since we wanted to go to the Disney Studios after, we couldn't use it.Fast passes are also a joke. We couldn't get any, since there's a limited number.You basically spend the day waiting in line. For the haunted house we waited 50 min, and it's definitely not worth even 15 min of waiting time. They could renew it, expand it, ...Most of all they could add interesting stuff along the line, so that you don't get bored. This is sometimes the case, but only at the last part of the line.We liked the Rock'n'Roller Coaster, but again, 1h 20 min of waiting for two min of emotions...Given the amount of people, the only viable thing they should propose are shows like the stunt one (Moteurs, Action!). It's very well done and 4000 people can watch it at the same time.Considering what we spent and the time we waited we really don't feel it's worth it.",-1
"Let's start by saying: you're better of avoiding a trip to this park in August. The queus are just too long (minimum 1 hour, up to 2 hours), the attractions break down regularly, the  fastpass  is a farce, because you can only use it twice on a day (given the times between the printing and use f the pass).The staff is friendly, but they have to obey so many bureaucratic rules, the organisation as a whole is very unfriendly. The Disneyland park scores  terrible  for me. It was the worst day for me of 2009 so far as I'm concerned. It's just a rip off.The second park (Disney Studios) is much better organised and has acceptable waiting times. This is mainly due to the high capacity of most shows   attractions. In this park you will enjoy your stay much better. You actually see a lot of things. The rollercoasters here are also much too crowded. The Nemo rollercoaster for instance had a 2 hour queue. Just skip it!This park scores  average .The combination of both parks scores poor for me. The management of Disney should work to improve this, this is not worthy of the Disney brand.",-1
"We (2 adults 2 kids) went Fri Sun in August, stayed in the Newport Bay Hotel. Hotel was OK family room a bit cramped. Basicaly a large  box  hotel with a fancy facade. The Park itself, well disappointing. Up to an hour and a half wair for some rides, fortunately hotel guests get in 2 hours early otherwise we wouldn't have bothered with most of them. Everything is very expensive to the point of rip off. You can't bring food drink in so you have to buy theirs. Example lunch   4 sandwiches, 4 bottles water 40 Euro.Two days is enough, during the last day the kids just wanted to go back to the hotel, boorish rude people pushing their way around the place I'd had enough too.My kids have been to Parc Asterix twice and would love to go back   they don't want to go back to Disney and that sort of says it all.",-1
"Went with my sisier and her 3 children, stayed at explorer hotel, found that disney park and studios park, that when there was queing for rides our children being pushed by other nationalities behind who seem to think that they did not have to que for their turn on the rides. Also during charcter walk a bouts, as soon as they knew English children were waiting, would turn to other euopean Children to have photos taken.My biggest complaint was at the 5pm parade i was asked by Disney park staff while waiting for aprade to start, if i was German on saying no english, i was told to move and take my children with me, which i refused as i felt my sister children had a much right to watch the parade from the front as other children, low and behold i was told to move my children again so a french family could see the parade, we did not move.I have been to disney in Florida 3 times and never experienced anything like i did in Paris, this 3 night break cost   1300, i suggest people save up a bit more and have a far better experience in florida. Also food so expensive in Disney Village, 5 pizza just over 100 euros, no drinks included.",-1
"It was crowded. The only reason we went in was to see the Frozen Queen and Princess. It happened to be the most popular attraction. In the morning, they said they had 4 hour wait times   we went in the afternoon and the lady at the line acted like she was doing us a favor telling us it was just over 2 hours. I didn't mind waiting the 2 hours while my husband and toddler played, but some of the guest service folks were irritable and terse. In defense of Disney, we are not Disney fanatics. It's just not our dream vacation. We could have taken our entire family to hike the rainforest in Costa Rica for less money and wouldn't have to wait in line. We gave it a try and it was about as expected. We enjoyed the Character Breakfasts much more. ",-1
"I am really disappointed with Disneyland.Old, tired, over crowded and prices are simply a money grab.The fast pass is a rip off and only allows you to reserve a ride every 2 hours.Fast pass again is a money grab that allows people to pay extra money to jump the queue in front of other customers. This is so wrong on many levels. Honest paying customers having to wait in line longer while others jump the queue. I absolutely hate what the fast pass allows. It makes my blood boil as these rich people jump the queue ahead of me. From listening to others in the lines, others agree. Poor form!The characters are hardly seen, forget a photo, there are so many people.Admission price, really.. very over priced. 2 put of 10 stars",-1
I book Disney for   200 for the day for our family of four and there was absolutely no value for money at all. During the day we saw absolutely no Disney characters and felt we could have been in any theme park. The shops and restaurants were stupidly overpriced and the only 'ride' the kids enjoyed was the play area! It's a shame Disney are more concerned about making money than entertaining kids. We won't be going back..,-1
"This is one of the most horrendous experience i have ever had. What a waste of time and money. We were looking forward to a magical disney experience but just ended up feeling drained and stressed. It took us two hrs to get on one thrill ride, which really was pathetic. Really young Kids were allowed on the ride and no staff member seemed to care about the height restriction. The so called fast tracking was was pointless as you ended up queuing anyway and most were closed by midday, which was a complete joke. People were queuing for up to two hrs to get on a ride. The over crowding was plain to see and was a complete fire and safety issue. Also adults were smoking constantly in the park whether it was in toliets, restaurants and through the park itself, aswell as standing in the queues. Never mind being bad for kids, i ended up coughing and my clothes were stinking of smoke. The non smoking policy is ignored by staff and customers. Many rides aswell had techincal faults which made the queues even longer. Not once did we see staff dressed up as disney characters, no show, nothing. Everyone seemed miserable and stressed. We didnt see one smiling face unless it was a relief to get on a ride and even then it was forced as all the enjoyment had been taking out of it. We had enough and went and complained at the city hall building. We asked for a refund but were told we had to write an email. To make it up to us they give us five rides, and they promised if we went and showed the ' special' ticket to the guy at the exit of each ride then he would get us through without waiting in line. Three out of three rides i guess wasnt bad. The other two we still queued for about twenty mins. We couldnt wait to leave as we were hungry to but restaurants to had long queues and alot were closed. Never again. Avoid avoid avoid!!!",-1
"It pains me to write this, but if you have been to the orignal Disneyland in Anaheim, skip Disneyland Paris. It looks like Disneyland, smells like Disneyland but isn't what Walt dreamed of. The suits have taken this place over and although the buildings are beautiful, there are little nuances that those like me will notice. Such as no trees in the hub. Attractions such as Pirates with some figures that should be in a dark ride or have been purchased from a broke amusement park! Queues for some attractions look like they are left over from the original 1950s Disneyland and there were no cast members even on a heavy day with guests to guide the guests when there were long lines. People do smoke in Europe much more than in the US but in Disneyland Paris, it made me think it was a health aid and it did not add to my enjoyment of the Park by having people blow smoke on me. Not a little but a lot. But I know this isn't DLPs fault as they have to let everyone enjoy themselves or they won't come.Overall, I will pass next time in Paris on visiting and confine my visits to the original Disneyland.",-1
"This was our 3rd visit to the park as our son is now 3 and would have enjoyed the magic of Disney, especially in its 20th year anniversary. We paid around   700 for a 4 day pass for 5 of us and were desperately disappointed that despite visiting some of these rides 3 times, they remained out of service.It was a very enoyable experience for our 3 year old but our teen daughters were left with no choice but to stand in the overextended queues for second rate rides as the primary attractions were not running.We felt cheated and when we broached the subject with the park management office we were dismissed out of hand and quite rudely to boot.Wont be coming back in a hurry as attitudes were poor.....Florida holds far more appeal and much better value for money.",-1
"All in all, the park and studios are good fun if you and your kids don   t mind the constant walking and queuing. Positives: some really good rides and shows (when they   re not being cancelled), including the end of day illuminations. See below for my faves.Negatives: the drinking fountains aren   t shown on the app, most food choices from the various stalls a fast food style rubbish, you can   t get a decent coffee anywhere (McDonalds was the best    I can   t believe I just wrote that but it   s true); Magic Time (for Disney Hotel guests) is helpful but not all rides are available at that time. And, as you might expect, everything is massively overpriced. Feel that Disney Magic in your wallet!Really negatives: disgusting blocked toilets in more than one location; very poor experience with the Disney hotel (Cheyenne) which put a downer on the holiday.HINTS: the app, while being very far from perfect, is worthwhile having as the queue times are broadly correct (most of the time) and use the Fast Pass system to help skip past the worst of the queues.Best rides for adults and older kids: Tower of terror (scary!), hyperspace mountain, rock and roller coaster and big thunder mountain.Best riders for younger kids (6 ish in our cases, although we all enjoyed these): Ratatouille, Star Wars Tour, the Circus train thing at the top of the park, it   s a small world, Pirates of the CaribbeanBest shows: Mickey and the Magician, end of day illuminations, Moteurs Action and the Studio Tram tour. Pirates and Princesses parade was pretty good too, wasn   t impressed by the Pirate show.",-1
Any Disney afficianados will understand the title line which is probably as much as needs saying. Whilst well intentioned it lack sthe atmosphere some may be looking for.,-1
I took my 12 year old for his 2nd visit to DP. I was disappointed to learn they had changed their policy for guests with disabilies. Upon checking our doctor's letter we were given a disabled pass. This allowed us to go to some rides and be given a time to return for more popular rides it was just a way to keep us in a separate queue incase children with autism do not attack normal people. We had to wait 20 mins in Thunder Mountain my son had a meltdown he started attacking myself and my daughter and on of the cast members. They still would not let us ride. We called the manager. A unfriendly person with no knowledge of Autism who explained policy had changed everyone had to wait we could leave if we want. Huh over   2000 had been spent on this and that's what a manager says. How do you tell a Autistic child they cannot get on a ride he pushed my daughter and she hurt her head on the gate and started bleeding. My son hurt his leg but still refused to leave. After the ride we had to take him to first aid and left the park. The next day I complained to Guest Servicea the pig headed manager refused to come down and speak to me I made a official complaint and left. My advice to parents of kids with Autusm is contact Disneyland Paris and ask about their facilities for the disabled before you waste your money here. As a regular visitor I have been 8 times unless there is a policy change.,-1
"No animatronics.. no nothing. The mini castle is a joke. When will Disney stop making money with this nonsense? They don t use the technology available today to create magic, as Walt used to do in the past. A forever gone era it seems. They can go on opening gift shops... they don t have the creative gift Walt Disney have.And in Hong Kong it s most noticeable. It s a shame.Take your children to the Science Museum in Hong Kong it s wonderful.",-1
"Its a shame this park carry the name Disney... They build the place years back and they are now just collecting cash without any effort, it does not compare in anything with the American parks which are truly amazing. The whole park now is designed to get money from their guests on every step without offering any services. The staff are truly miserable and seems like they hate their job. In the whole park there were no characters walking around at all so a kid can take a picture. There were 3 characters who a kid could meet in the whole park but you had to wait forever just to take a picture. Many rides where closed and the wait time for anything was 60 minutes or more, who in the world can make a a kid stand still in a waiting line for 60 Minutes or more? Avoid at all costs especially if you have young children. PS. Parking is    30 to park 30 minutes walk from the entrance after spending    75 person for your ticket...just ridiculous ",-1
"Be prepared to wait up to 60 120 min for a ride, that lasts only 60seconds. your feet will ache and your children will drive you crazy when your in the queue. I thought I was the only parent trying to keep a straight face for the kids, but when I looked at the others all of them were biting their lips or holding their heads in their hands! My children started to get sore noses and throats at the amount of smokers around them. There was a place in Disneyland where someone was puffing their toxic fumes at children. Think twice before you go, I wish I did.",-1
Wow. How the mighty have fallen. I have not been for about 12 years and was totally horrified to find out how much the place has deteriorated. Quite a few of the rides were not open.    15 for a burger. The main cafe was filthy. 90 minutes queuing for a ride. The whole place is in need of refurbishment. Comparing it to Florida there is no comparison. Rip off. ,-1
"We visited Disneyland Paris in July 2014 with our two children aged 2y o and 5y o. I can honestly say, that our boys would have more fun at a good swing park, we arrived at 11am and by 3pm had seen everything, we had an Access Pass to get on rides quicker, but our boys were either too young or too small, but apart from that it just didn't excite them. The only time they got excited was when we visited the Disney store on site and they could pick some toys we hadn't seen before, but even these broke within 24hrs and we are currently waiting for Disney to reply to our email of complaint (which by the way has taken us over 3 days just to get the correct email address from them). Honestly, if you want to experience Disney, go to the states, we didn't even see any characters, I spotted one of the Disney Princess characters about 60ft away, but she was desperate to get out of the way, she wasn't even stopping for photos with young girls eager to meet her, parents were running ahead of her to try and get a photo of her as she walked towards them, I could see the disappointment on so many faces...just shocking. We decided to dine at one of the onsite restaurants, which only served fast food, similar to McDonalds really, I bought two chicken sandwich meals and two children's chicken nugget meals, I also bought two Mickey Mouse straws for the boys...it cost 56 euros, we then had to sit and watch some budget dance show which was like watching dancers that weren't quite good enough for BGT. I will never return to this place, just an overrated Disney world copy and like any copy, it's just not as good!",-1
"Have been to Disneyland Paris in mid August, and the park is simply not worth the effort, for 3 main reasons:1) Crowd: although I am aware that August attracts the most people, the crowd and   even more important   the lines to ride the various attractions were just crazy. We basically rode on not more than 5 6 attractions in an entire day, with lines up to 1.5 hours, especially for the most thrilling ones, like Big Thunder Mountain (though more or less that's the same even for other activities   the wait time for children to meet and have a photo with Disney princesses was indicated as 75 mins!2) Overpriced: everything, from the entrance (more than 60    ) to food and souvenirs has just too high a price   again, of course all parks have more or less the same attitude, but spending more than 6 euros for an hot dog (scarse quality bread and a wurstel) is just as crazy3) For 2 (two!) times in a day, rides failed while we were in line (Pirates and Big Thunder Mountain). The result? After spending 30 mins waiting, we had to come back later, of course with double the people in queue   and more hours thrown away. Maybe it was an unlucky day, but I wouldn't be so sure..Conclusion: probably kids will love the setting (I admit it was truly beautiful, pure Disney universe) but the rides for adults are very very limited in number (their  ghost house  wouldn't scare a first grader I'd say), let alone the time spent in line, from tickets to rides to have lunch.Not worth it.",-1
"Like the studios in need of a large cash injection. Too many attractions with brokendown displays. Unhelpful staff who have little commonsense or initiative when dealing with visitors. Impossible to get a basic ice cream for a young child!! Ben and Jerrys closed till mid evening? Queue times very very optimistic and food prices high for poor quality. Not the park it was 5 years ago, having visited many times since 1998.",-1
"Sad to say, this is the last time I   ll ever visit Disney. It   s an over crowded, worn out park that has nothing to offer than 2.5 hour wait times with smelly Americans who fart because of the amount of junk food they consume. Nothing worked as it should, and all our photos from the small amount of rides we actually got to go on we   re in accessible due to the payment system failing. Don   t waste your time and money to line up.",-1
"I would like to share my very disappointing experience at Disneyland Paris .From a young child I had always wanted to go to Disney ,to experience the magic , to meet the characters etc .So I saved to take my youngest daughter for her 10th birthday as you can imagine she was so excited .Early Saturday morning we set off from home with expectations of a truly wonderous experience ahead of us .Sadly that is not what we experienced ,as a mother whose child   s only birthday present was to go to Disneyland Paris I felt so very disappointed and sad for my little girl who was left absolutely heart broken .My parents who live in Cyprus travelled to the UK to be able to share this experience with their Granddaughter ,so this was not a cheap undertaking on our behalf and we did at least expect some value for money .So we all bought fast passes to allow us to get on the rides with a minimum wait time as my father has trouble standing for long periods and we had a Drs letter to back this up . However when we tried to use the fastpass there was no rides available until 17.00hrs which meant we were unable to go on any rides for over a 4 hour wait . There was a whole variety of rides closed which meant the ones that were working had over 1.5hr queues as all the people were concentrated on the rides that did work if you queued as there was no Fastpass available . Things closed even ran to basics like restaurants and toilets , trying to get lunch took over an hour queuing and the chose of places to eat limited in the park .All the adverts advertising Disney show the characters wandering around and interacting with the children , there was none of this which I feel is a misrepresentation of what you are actually purchasing, after all you are purchasing the Disney experience not just a theme park with rides. I do not need to travel to France to go to one of those .I did see two meet and greets with Donald and Pluto however we went to see Mickey mouse but he was not too be found . We did see Cinderella however, she rushed past not speaking to any one , was clearly in a hurry and it was not even midnight .We ended up leaving the park with an absolutely sobbing young girl whose magical dreams had been so badly broken . My Daughter Charlotte did not get to go on any rides , she didn   t get to see any of the characters other that what I have explained above ,and her dreams of Disneyland are shattered .My husband has been to Disneyland Florida and although there are queues , which are to be expected we realise that .His experience was so much better , parades 3 x a day ,characters available to meet and pictures that can be taken , rides working and so on .This new fastpass system of being able to book your rides in advance needs addressing as it clearly isn   t working for everyone or people with a day ticket .I feel that I should share this absolutely terrible experience as I would hate for other children to go through what my little girl did . This experience happened on Saturday 12 1 2019 . It also appears to me that you ONLY get the Disney experience if you stay in the Disney hotels ,otherwise no one appears to care that you are not getting what you pay for , this is something I also think should be made very clear from the start .Disney is a brand after all that is only as good as the people who are buying in to the magical dream , buying the merchandise ,going to the films. We the people who do that, should at least get the experience that we have paid for .Its like if you went to a Jeweller and paid for a diamond and was given coal .This is all such a great shame as so many people hold Disney on such a pedestal .I also have sent my complaint to Disneyland Paris guest relations on the 14 1 2019 ,i am yet to recieve a reply or acknowlegedement of my email .I would not recommend this park .",-1
"We have just come back from Disney Paris after a week stay in the Hotel Santa Fe .This has been our eighth time to Disney Paris .WE WERE VERY DISAPPOINTED this time .There used to be lots of shows ,like Lion King ,Christmas winter wonderland show ,both these are sadly no more .The hole park is starting to look shabby, broken paths dirty walls and some smelly WC S.The staff are not as cheerful and friendly as years past ,when we first started visiting Disney the staff had the Disney spark ,sadly this seems to be missing .A lot of the parks rides are very dated now and are in need of refurbishment .Studio tram tour ,boring ,the canyon is still good but the props as you drive around are a joke and the reign of fire would be better if a Dragon actually came out of the pipe .Time they had more of Disney Cars better photo ops ,no Disney Cars even in the Parades . The Lighting Mcqueen in the stunt show also very boring .Also rides breaking down ,the Buzz broke down ,Casey Jones broke down ,Crush coaster broke down ,Pinochio broke down and the rear of the Tanker in the canyon tram tour did not even ignite ,we must be the most unlucky family as these were all in one day .Also there needs to be more thrilling rides built,take a tip out of Universal studios ,or Thorpe park UK.The new Ratatouie ride is good but nothing to write home about ,once you have been on it once ,once is enough .Go In the single rider line not worth a 40 minute wait in normal line . .The parades very very small now .The parades were a delight to watch years ago .Even the tree lighting ceremony just a light show now ,no characters dancing around.Stars in there cars this is an understatement one car in front handful of characters walking behind then another car ,they then go in to the circle of which is roped of so trying to get pics with characters a joke .There used to be lots of characters around the parks, years past, now its spot the character .Why cant they get more characters and have people line up and move along each character like Disney Florida .Also people smoking all over the park where ever you go ,people smoking while we were queuing ,My Wife complained to staff on many occasion and the staff did nothing .While my wife was waiting for my son and I to come of the parachutes ,it was raining and people were sheltering under the photo point under the parachute with other people ,a woman decided to start smoking ,my wife moved over to the large umbrella a female staff member was stood and told my wife to move as she was causing a Health and Safety obstruction for disabled access to the ride, my wife told the staff member that the woman was smoking ,so the staff member told my wife to tell her to put it out, my wife replied to the staff member   you should be telling the smoking woman to put it out . Too many people smoking around the parks .The park is more bothered about opening more over priced merchandise shops and restaurants .We were also awoken by booming really like music around midnight ,I thought there was a show going on at the Santa Fe,it was so loud even the windows were shaking .I did phone the reception and there response was it was coming from the Disney Village so I felt sorry for people in the Hotels closer to the Village .Who ever the Director is, of Disney Paris, needs to get a grip and get the Parks back to the DISNEY MAGIC FROM YEARS PAST .If he cant then give the job to someone who can .Save your money go to Florida you will never look back .For short breaks go to Places in uk Like Thorpe Park ,Alton Towers Etc I will not be going back to Disney Paris for a long time there needs to be a drastic change for me and my family to go back now and I will be telling my friends and family about our latest experience .",-1
"disney land paris should be renamed disney shopping centre paris. i was there 18th to 22nd of may 2014 and the rides had massive cues and if you wanted to see a character the cue was at least an hour i cued for 11 2 hours to see rapunzel if you want to see princesses it more than 2 hours just to get the booking to see them. the food is awful and the merchandise was shoddy and very expensive. a lot of the rides were closed due to refurbishing and others broke down whilst in the cue. the only thing that was magical was the light show but that started at 10.30pm so it was difficult keeping kids awake. this was my second visit and i will not be going for a third as it is far too commercialised its all about spending the fun has been taken out of it, i was very disappointed.",-1
"Far too many people, rude service, uncomfortable, parades always impeded on foot traffic, not fun and I dont advise bringing family",-1
"Over priced, long queues (I got on 3 rides) the rides were no different from Thorpe Park, no seating area to eat your lunch.....I could go on. Advice? Stay at home or save your money and go to DL USA",-1
"My granddaughter (age 10) and I spent over a week in London and Paris. On the last day of our trip we decided to go to the Paris Disneyland. As it was the end of June, it was very crowded. The Disney staff was no where near as pleasant or accommadating as in the Florida Disney, in fact, most were neutral to downright rude. We did both parks in one day   very small compared to Disney World. The food venues were crowded and overpriced, but the same can be said with Florida. We waited in line for both food and rides, as expected. But what was not expected was that whole families of people would push ahead and cut the line. This happened 4 times while we were there. When others complained, it did no good. As for characters, we only saw 2  princesses  hurrying off toward their break. If you are an American and have access to Disney World, don't bother with this. Even my granddaughter was a bit dissappointed.",-1
"I paid how much to stand in a line for hours?!? It took me an hour just to get to the bag inspection. It is wall to wall people, quite literally. I recall decades ago we could check off all the rides in a day and have a blast doing it. Now, we will be lucky to ride 4 or 5 after standing for 75   135 minutes in the hot sun for each ride. I would much rather they tell me tickets are sold out than keep packing people in and making things miserable. Plus, I get the privilege of overpaying for food and drink. $5 for a coke? $4 for a small bag of chips? I will NOT return to this park.",-1
"Visited Disney with 100000 of my friends. Couldn't move, only got to go on a few rides, couldn't see the parade. Even had a restricted view of the fireworks. Would be a great place off peak, but shuffling around the park not being able go move is not that much fun. Especially paying a fortune for it . ",-1
"The wait attending the attractions really ruins the experience for me. I have not been for many years because of this, and I hope they have improved it. It is also a very costly proposition for a family, admission, parking, food, no freebies to be found. They never cut the customers any slack. Nearby Knotts have a special for Veterans in November, but service for the country does not count at the Magic Kingdom.",-1
"I'm a huge Disney fan! I love all things Disney...... except Disneyland Paris. It is an embarrassment to the Disney name. * Lack of maintenance, the park looks tired to say the least* poor hygiene, toilets are dirty * Lack of staff in every respect in every area and every department there is a vast lack of cast members.* hardly any characters! Forget the adverts with the Disney Character's around the park, no chance!!! Try queing for hours if your lucky, all the marvel characters are usually fully booked prior. * poor mannered, miserable, rude, slow cast members. * poor management, try asking for a manager, no chance! They have tens of thousands of people turn up a day, you don't matter. It's a take it or leave it scenario. In conclusion, save up for a bit longer, bite the bullet and go for a once in a life time trip to one of the American Disney's, they are truly magical and the Americans know how to do customer service.As the American Cast Members say 'have a magical day!!'",-1
We have visited Disney World numerous times but always wanted to visit Disneyland. We should have saved our money and gone back to Florida. Our park tickets from Florida weren't good for California so we had to buy new tickets. Many many attractions were closed for refurbishment or some other reason. They were late letting us into park on early admission days. Many rides then didn't open until well after the public was let in. I love Disney but California was way more expensive than Florida and nowhere near the quality of Disney World. Disneyland is not as friendly or as organized as Disney World. We were very disappointed.,-1
"It was cold and a bit rainy so that didn't help especially since I usually go to Orlando to see Mickey. My biggest complaint by far is that most of my favorite rides were closed. I feel so ripped off. They should be selling the tickets at half priced since you get half the rides. It's crazy. Big Thunder Mountain and The Haunted House were closed   you should just shut down Frontier land...nothing else left there. Dumbo was closed, Tea cups were dry! It was just a big waste of money. I am glad I got to see it but it was disappointing to say the least. I hope it improves.",-1
"It was very disappointing the treatment of staff though is a place for children. Very rude and not polite. The day before that we went to Universal Studios and the staff was really nice, polite and helpfull.   The food is very expensive and small portions",-1
"I travelled with my daughter and 8 year old grandson, staying 3 nights. We arrived early evening and decided to keep going and stay for the night show at the castle, starts at 11pm but get there early to bag a good spot. The show was remarkable and the highlight of our trip. My grandson loved everything about the Park, despite the searing 30 degree heat! Queues are long, especially to see the characters, mostly without any shelter, difficult for people with very young children. The Park was small, compared to Florida, but enough for my grandson, ( and me!)The parade at 5pm lasted 12 minutes! Again, get your spot early, especially with young children.Two days was more than enough, to visit all the different parts of the Park, plus the studios. Lots of rides for little ones, but I think teenagers would be bored, as there are not many big rides. The toilets were filthy, take wipes with you. I only saw one water fountain, but plenty of stalls where you could buy drinks. Neither the toilets or water fountain are signposted.You may want to consider buying priority passes, to avoid hour long queues. I'm glad we took my grandson, he loved it, but I wouldn't return. I'd rather go to Florida next time.",-1
I didn't have high expectations for Euro Disney but did expect that the park would have the same standards as the US Disney destinations. I was shocked at how filthy the bathrooms were and how rude the 'cast members' were to the visitors. One of the cast members actually yelled at a visitor who didn't get on the ride quickly or efficiently enough for her. I would have let that go but it happened on 2 other rides with other cast members. There isn't a lot to do at the park but there were a lot of restaurants that weren't open. The ones that were open the food was not good at all. The train ride out was nice but I wouldn't waste a day in Paris by going there again.,-1
"The only positive I have to say about Disneyland California is that the night show and fireworks show are absolutely amazing. Staff are rude and unorganised. Found our place for the night show and sat for 3 hours behind the rope, 15 minutes before show starts a rude female staff member tells us that this is a area for wheelchairs only, would have been nice to be told hours before the start of the show as there was other staff walking around who had not even approached up prior to this point. Perhaps organise the wheelchair area prior to 15 minutes before show time and perhaps don't demand people to move but explain in a nice manner. Maybe staff need to do some training in customer relations. Very disappointed considering this was the diamond anniversary and our family was so excited travelling half way across the world to be here only to have our experience ruined by rude staff. Meant to be the happiest place on earth, not in my opinion and we certainly will not be back.",-1
"Full of Mainland tourists, spitting and pushing and shoving. IS NOT THE HAPPIEST PLACE ON EARTH!!! Expensive!!",-1
"Our family of 4, including one free child, paid $250 to get in to do what? we got to see 5 features rides since we spent all the time in line ups and this is February!! To the see Tinkerbell was over an hour wait, waited 45 minutesbut never got to see Mickey as we were told we had to wait at least another 45 minutes to see it. For a place so busy, it was hard to find food, we had to walk over 20 minutes to find something, as compared to San Diego Zoo or Seaworld. $250 is a lot of money to spend to be in line ups all day and obviously Disney does not have to give a damn as the place was crowded and we were told even more crowded in the summer months. So bottom line is if people are willing to thro wgood money at bad, then Disnet will continue to rape you!",-1
It is ridiculus to wait 30 minutes on the queu and ride for just 1 minute. Would not prefer to come again. Tivoli is much better and nicer place to be. Recommended for people enjoying waiting. Utku,-1
The park is small and some great rides closed in the limited number of rides that they have. The biggest thing missing in the park is the not so friendly staff missing the expected Disney smile and courtesy be it the ride operators or folks in the restaurants. Not recommended if you are a big fan of the  Happiest place on Earth  way of functioning of US Disney parks which they take literally ,-1
"I wouldn't recommend visiting Disneyland during summer. This was my 4th visit to Disney & probably my last.We arrived when the park opened & had a great first 2 hours, but by 12 the park was so crowded we could barely move. The average wait time for a ride was 1.5 hours.The park continued to get more & more crowded as the day went on.We wanted to give our kids the full Disney experience so we battled the crowds until 8.30 & decided to then try to leave. However, leaving the park & this time was almost impossible, as the light parade & fireworks were about to begin. As we tried walking out of the park we were yelled at by almost every Disney employee we passed because according to them you can't go anywhere near the parade unless you have sat and reserved a spot(which means sitting for 5 hours). Everything stops in the park at this time so you have no choice but to leave however this is impossible. We all left the park feeling horrible ( not the happiest place on earth after all).",-1
"We came to Disney Land with high hopes and excitement after been to the one in Japan 4 months ago. However from the minute we first entered the gates we were already let down by the attention of detail compared to Japan! However we continued on with a open mind. A positive were the lines were definitely shorter than Japans as there is alot less people visiting the park. Once we had been on a couple of rides we noticed a huge difference between the parks! its actually disappointing to see that there is a massive difference, wether this is due to the park being older im assuming. The Park is well over due for a major refurb. The food definitely needs attention to as there is limited food options that are at the reasonable price. 60 euros for a steak is beyond a joke! This park is missing the Disney feel we got from Japans park. I think management needs to go check out the difference of quality between these two as we were not the only ones to say this. Two other couples we spoke to said the same thing but with Florida and California being better. Ino people made read this and think this is harsh however its reality. If this is your first disney experience you can only go upwards from here.Likes:All roller coaster ridesoption of two parkschuros stand at the entrance before entering the parkDislikes:Smoking throughout the park especially in lines, when there is dedicated smoking areas. (know one polices this!)Poor food! (Steer clear of there hot dogs) if you want a decent meal you will pay 60 euros for a steak!Fast pass booths close early.Park opening at 10am for people who are not staying in the resort. While resort guests were able to enter at 8:30am! Male staff entering female toilets to clean while females are present making them feel very un easy! More then one lady complained out loud about this! This would have to be the biggest concern we seen! ",-1
"Went there to check the place out on my own. Walked around the whole place (strolling   not hurrying) it took only 15 minutes   YES, I am not making a mistake   15 minutes. Obviously if you take your kids and queue for the rides etc... you will spend longer but the place is so small it can only be described as pathetic.",-1
Just back from euro disney and was warned by friends and family of what a complete rip off this place is! Have been to florida some years back and it is a different class to this dump. I will not go on about the price and quality of the food but the prices are just utterly ridiculous. The hotel (explorers) had the smallest room myself and family have ever stayed in!! The best tip I can give is to save your money and go to florida or get yourself a merlin annual pass for the uk parks which I have and works out very good value.,-1
"Filthy park, rude employees. To many visitors made the stay unbarable. The non smoking areas was not overheld and the staff did not take action towards those who broke the law. I have been to Disney World in Florida and Disneyland Park did not meget my expectations.",-1
"Went here with better anticipation. Probably my own fault for coming during tue summer holidays. All my daughters wanted to do was meet a princess. Could not happen unless we stood for over an hour and half. For 3 4 yr olds that is not practical. I advise for the princess pavilion they do a tickets service like toon house in Disney Studios. Rides were very poor for the time waited, example 45 mins for peter pan and then having my 4 year old quoting that it was too short and boring, Having visited DisneyWorld Florida I will not waste my money on this establishment ever again. I would rather fly to the USA for the weekend then come back to France. Standard rude French staff but not all. Food Drinks price to be expected, people smoking everywhere and security just allowing it. This was more like two days of hell then two days of Fun. Save your money snd fly to USA.",-1
"A total disappointment... waste of money. We were in the Ist batch to enter the park, I have toddler so height restriction made us to visit the rides that suites him.. but after one hour,.. its queue of minimum 45 minutes wait, moving ahead we saw, 75minutes wait for other rides, 90 minutes is too long to wait and take a picture with Mr. Mickey,.. Too much crowed and we didn't enjoy much,..we returned to our hotel in Paris by 1:30pm,.. our excitement didn't last long :(Be prepared for a long wait for lunch or breakfast if you didn't reserve one.",-1
"The crowds between Christmas and New Year's make for a bad experience. Took an hour just to get into the park. I would love to know max capacity vs. Universal Studios, because we did more in one hour at Universal than we did in 10 hours at Disney.Cast members are always running somewhere and spend little to no time with their fans. At Universal, we got pictures with numerous cast members and spent only seconds to a few minutes in line for each of those pics.",-1
"We visited Disneyland on a wet day and what was really noticeable was how long we spent standing in lines waiting for things. It wasn't hugely busy and yet one of the rides had a 60 minute wait in the rain. The time on the rides was often just a few minutes long after 10 30 minutes of waiting to get on them and once everyone was on the ride they seemed to take quite a while to get going. The signage in the parks is bad, the management of the flow of people, how they find information, where people walk was poor. Once you were in a queue it was hard to get out and it felt like there was a lack of investment in the structure of the park. A lot of the rides had a part that wasn't operational. I was generally disappointed. In spite of this we enjoyed a number of the rides and our day wasn't a complete wash out. It's a Small World, Dumbo the elephant, Pirates of the Caribbean were good fun but it was expensive for something that just generally felt like it could have been done better.",-1
"Having seen the universal studios in LA, we went with great expectations to the Disney Studios and Disneyland Park in Paris. We went on a Monday to avoid crowds but it was not only overcrowded, some of their rides failed after our waiting in line for more than 90 minutes. The staff are overwhelmed and under pressure, no one was polite. Came back disappointed, having wasted a prescious day in Paris.The park is mismanaged. It is evident from the fact that they don't restrict entry when excessive tickets are sold out. We could only take one ride between 10:30am and 5:30pm, due to the long lines and failures in between. We wanted to give feedback and demand a refund (something we haven't done in years) but the line at the city hall way stop long and the lady at the gate rudely refused to hear us.I would recommend no one should ever go there.",-1
Having visited Disneyland Paris some 25 years ago we decided to spend the last day of our holiday at Disneyland Hong Kong. The rides were outdated and given HK love of all things electronic we expected more. There was a greater variety of rides in Paris. The parades started late   so we missed the last few minutes of the evening parade as we had a coach pick up to meet. The parades were not a patch on Paris some 25 years agoThe majority of the staff were rude and unhelpful   unlike the Paris staff. Given that English is widely spoken in HK a lot of the staff barely understood English. Putting it mildly it was an utter disappointment from start to finish.,-1
"This was a long awaited day trip that missed the mark for us. It came at the end of a 5 day trip to Paris and sadly it was a very expensive and disappointing day. Very lengthy queues for all attractions, many at well over an hour and the parks were extremely crowded. There was little accurate information at the start of the rides as to waiting times. We only managed 6 rides across the two parks in 9 hours although what we went on were very good   Rock n rollercoaster was the best. Few visible disney characters around the park.The park in places is looking a bit shabby and needs a facelift. Food was tasty but at 45 Euros for in effect a Mcdonalds meal, this was not good value. Take drinks and snacks.We had visited disney before here and in the States but we wont be visiting again. Our Disney dream is over.",-1
"We are returning visitors to Disneyland, every time we go to California we visit the park. This was our 5th visit. It was, however, almost to the day 6 years since our previous visit to the park, and since then someone in the managment must have given priority to profits over maintenance of the rides. Prices was higher than ever, but I have never experienced so many breakdowns and problems with the rides. We experienced several cancellations due to technical problems, which is really annoying when you already have spent half and hour in the line. In the haunted house it was even worse, it broke down while we were inside the ride, with an unexpected half hour wait in the basement as a result. During our stay in California we have visited Disneyland, Universal Studios and Six Flags, two of the three gave value for money, Disneyland did not. Don't go there. We have been there for the last time.",-1
"First the positives   parade, light show and 2 lots of fireworks to welcome in 2014. All were executed with typical Disney aplomb.The negatives   this event was unsafe, uncomfortable and the D organisation cared little for the basic comforts of the  guests  who paid around $100 a pop to experience the night. I had to argue with one of the  cast  to access a restroom so my daughter could wait in a line for 25 minutes to use the facilities.This was because they were trying to enforce a one way system on the crowd in an apparent effort to avoid crushing.Not my idea of enjoyment   only an illustration of corporate greed.",-1
"Did you know selfie sticks are dangerous?It seems the folks at Disneyland think so. So much so that they will take them from you and destroy them with no form of compensation to the affected party. Oh they give you the option of doing a 40 minute round trip back to your car or hour round trip back to your hotel, but why would a  guest  want to do that? So they took my stick, my complaints to the bag checker and his supervisor went unheard EVEN THOUGH the day before the same security guard didn't notice it was in my bag and I was allowed in with this weapon of mass destruction. My next recourse was to wait 30 minutes at  Guest Relations  to discuss my unhappiness at the happiest place on Earth. My customer service rep gasped when I told him I was not happy. Nicely done. Once the reason was discovered however he lost compassion and explained to me that company policy prohibited such items in the park and it clearly stated this on the website. Fine. I discussed my desire to be placated...compensated...somehow made happy after being treated like a criminal. To which said representative informed me that he had no ability or authorization to do so. I promptly asked for a supervisor who came minutes later. Once again I recounted my story and received the same reply...policy...prohibited...website...sorrySo I asked again what can YOU do to ease my irritation. Her reply was to pull out a blue form so that I could register my complaint. Needless to say I was not amused and left the area with a loud retort of  useless  as I left. As I stand in line for Nemo and write this I notice children playing roughly with onsite purchased light saber toys which in my estimation are more of a nuisance then a rotund 50 year old with a selfie stick. But hey what do I know....I didn't come up with the policyNow I have been visiting Disney parks since 1977....before the Internet (yes there was a time before smart phones and snippity snappity chat). And I have had overwhelmingly positive experiences in both Orlando and Cali. Not today howeverTo this I say Boo....boo to Blue Form Letters, boo to no one caring at all in Guest Relations, and BOO to the fact that two days admission to the park, food and souvenirs cost me close to 1000.00 and one of the richest businesses on Earth couldn't be bothered to offer me a free lunch or discount coupon for something to say  sorry I don't expect this review to influence any guests. It is fun to come here... Just remember leave your WMDs in your car or hotel before you come",-1
"I understand cost are going up but now it cost an average family of 5 more for one day at Disneyland then it cost for them to eat for 6 weeks. Hotels have gone up, gas to get there . They are better off going to the beach.",-1
I have been going to Disney for 40 years. This was the worst visit ever. I have never ever seen so many people packed in. I realize it was summertime but I seriously wonder if they were beyond a safe capacity. It was impossible to move. The lines were ridiculously long for everything   even with fast pass. I will never go there again   EVER! I felt the situation was not safe and I am not exaggerating!,-1
"I had lowered my expectations so I wouldn't be disappointed, but having half the rides closed, with some closing while my two nieces 10 and 12 were inline was unacceptable. If the closed rides were listed we would not have excited headed to them in anticipation. I really feel the entrance fee should have been reduced because of this. No major roller coaster. The only thing different than Anaheim and Orlando according to my nieces was that was a little different, but it didn't seem as high to me. It was a very cold experience almost  Stepford  like. No loud laughing running kids and smiling families. No characters roaming the park. Even the British families who had been to Orlando were just as disappointed. .No smells of cotton candy, tempting pastries or hot chocolate as we walked through. Maybe its just the French blas  ?",-1
"We went in the school summer holidays with my 5yr old and 3yr old and found the park way to expensive for what you get; the queues were, for the most part all over an hour long and that's just no fun for anyone whatever their age.When we did get on some rides there were not that great, the most memorable for me being the Peter Pan ride, a jerky ride in rooms so dark you could hardly see; where is the Disney magic?All in all I think we managed to get on about 7 rides in total   if you are going you really do need more than 1 day. But is it worth the money? I certainly don't think it was, not for the rides we managed to get on. I have a season ticket for Paulton Parks and the rides here are similar and the queues much, much shorter. Ok it does not have the Disney magic but its much cheaper!We may go back one day but it certainly will not be in a major holiday period as the park simply cannot cope with the volume of people.",-1
"Don't think of trying to come here if you don't have an experienced Disney local to help you find your way to get tickets and enter the park. We were shocked with the lack of information online beforehand, and the absence of people to help us find our way to the entrance and to explain how the park works. There are no helpful signs at the park entrance. When you ask people standing around chatting to each other in uniforms they get annoyed that you've interrupted their chats and tell you to go to the ticket booth. Where is the ticket booth???There are so many varieties of tickets available and strange systems of fast past etc. No information is available from Disney about how this all works. We had to spend hours beforehand reading reviews and blogs from Disney enthusiasts. Once we finally made it inside, paying a very tidy sum to do so, the place is jam packed with shops, shops and more shops! There are a few rides, but you'll spend hours and hours queuing for them. We really got the sense that Disneyland took our enthusiasm and efforts to come to Anaheim for granted. They didn't need to lift a finger to do anything to make it a happy place, as long as we were spending money ",-1
"Maybe it's a blast for very young children, but for adults it's a burden. The park is very poor maintained, food level is like Mcdonalds but 5x more expensive, waiting time should be calculated in hours and what amazed me the most is that there are hardly any Disney figures walking around in the park. So if you want to go to a Disneypark, choose Florida, USA; more fun, friendly employees and it's sunny : ) Oh, before people should think what a sour comment... I have year passes!",-1
"We came all the way from Europe to Disneyland , cause my 4 year old sons wante to see Mickey Mouse so so much and me myself have read several Disney books, where they explain their usiness concept, customer service etc ...  We saw Mickey , that was good , son was happy . But to be be honest, the whole park seems to be out of date , we really excpected so much more, and most of all, customer service s totally avarage , I even heard one of the employee talking bad language , good that my son doesnt undestand english :) .Day before we went to universal studios , and folks in Disney , tehy are really 10 year ahead of you , in everypossible way.....",-1
"This was the first visit to Disneyland for myself, my husband and two of our grandsons. We were so disappointed by how dirty the park was especially the bathrooms. Didn't find a clean one the whole 4 days there. The prices at the nicer restaurants are outrageous averaging $250 per dinner for the four of us. 90% of the staff i.e. Cast Members were unfriendly and some down right rude. Fast passes for the more popular rides were sold out by 10:00 AM every day. We were told we would get early admission one day with a multiple day pass but when we tried to use it we were told it is only good on specific days of the week. It was our last day, a Thursday and not valid on that day so we were turned away. We found the same scenario at California Adventure. We would never return to this place and wouldn't recommend it either. We go frequently to Disney World and will be going again in August this year. We have NEVER EVER been disappointed there. ",-1
My family and friends went to LA Disney today and to say we were disappointed is an understatement. Don   t waste your money. They say they allow 60000 to 70000 people before they shut the park. Try 200000. Could not move. Only half the Park was open due to power problems. We were there from 8am till late afternoon and only managed 2 rides. The lines were 2 to 3 hours wait on some rides. The rest were and hour. Didn   t see any characters and the lines for food were ridiculous. We traveled from Australia and this was our must do in LA. Forget it. Waste of time. Hated it. 1 Star is too many,-1
We had tickets for 4 days and only spent a total of 2 days in both parcs as it really was a miserable experience. Got stuck on Thunder mountain for an hour after queueing for an hour had to be rescued out only to be given a fast track ticket which I still have. Queued for Michael Jackson X0 only to be told it had broken down. Watched tourists jump barriers whilst staff just watched one family even lifted their buggy over a fence and climbed over to secure a place on the parc train. Moving travelators to get in and out of the park were broken. The best part about the whole holiday was Disney Village which is free to enter had a nice evening watching entertainment in the sunshine. ,-1
"Went there today in near 40 degree heat. The place was completely packed, and in certain areas, like New Orleans, it was almost impossible to move for people and prams. My initial euphoria at being there quickly wore off with average queue times an hour or more and almost no shade. It was like torture. Fast pass means the main queues move much more slowly. In the end I managed two rides. A third broke as I neared the front of the queue. It really didn't feel special or magical at all, and I have to say when I read other recent reviews I wonder if we were at the same place and how many are paid for. I don't consider a hundred dollars and hours of queuing to be value for money or special. I couldn't be bothered to queue for food so can't comment on that as I gave up after less than four hours. I will say Disney need to limit the number of people in the park and put up canopies on queue lines for their rides. I'm surprised no one has been seriously hurt by heat stroke or worse. I've seen it, so it's something off my wish list, but I couldn't help but feeling I was being royally shafted by Disney, who could do way more to make it a better place. And they ain't exactly short of cash and looking for change down the back of the sofa are they.",-1
"Having been to Disneyworld Orlando four time with my children many years ago that experience gave me a lifetime of memories. This year in May 2015 I decided with my wife to take my granddaughter to Disneyland Paris. I went for six days, five nights and paid for the premium food package on full board basis. I stayed at the New York hotel within the resort. The hotel was Ok but expected more for a four star hotel. I had an early flight unfortunately and arrived at the resort at 1020 am . I was told on check in that the room was not ready till 3 pm. Not good when you have a four year old who has been up and travelling since 4am. In most hotels in Europe rooms are usually available at mid day. I noticed that the tiles in the bathroom were cracked along the bottom by the floor and the beds were like sleeping on wooden pallets. The Disney parks were a let down, seven of the rides in both parks were broken (this you are not told before you book or arrive at location) The park was somewhat dirty and even though you saw cleaning staff around they were more interested in walking in three's and fours,talking,smoking and basically not doing what they were paid to do. The plants and shrubs and supposedly manicured areas were un kept. The buildings of the rides looked tired with worn out paint. The majority of staff were polite but I found that on some of the rides for children like the Rocket, Dumbo, mad hatters rides the more the queue's the less time you had to ride . It appeared that because of the queues one or two of the rides lasted only 1min 10sec.This park is very different to the USA parks, This park is very small and you can get round comfortably in about 2 and a half days. We queued for some 2hours forty minutes to get a picture and signature from one of the princesses. It was almost that for the other characters.You had to queue at 1030 in the morn to get a ticket for the princess pavilion but were then told your child could only see one and not any of the the others. The queues for other rides were deceptive it would say 5 mins when it fact it was 40 minutes when you passed the gate. How do you tell a child they cant go on it. Thank god she was an angel throughout the whole trip and we queued where necessary. People may say I'm just complaining but when you go to the US parks you kind of expect DISNEY to provide at least the same or similar don't you?. I must mention the meal plans. These are cruelly deceptive. I went for a full board premium plan and was told I could eat what I wanted from the menu and in any restaurant within the Disney resort I wanted. Not if you don't have a reservation!!!!!!! How can you reserve for a four year old. The premium plan allows you to choose from the al acarte menu but in some of the restaurants they have the premium plan menu, two starters, three main and three deserts to choose from wow!! All this for 125 euro ( $160) per meal for three. A meal for three could cost you as much as $200 plus If you don't buy the meal plans. There are other lower plans but the food is just as bad. Didn't know my child would be restricted to froi gras or smoked salmon. I expected far more choice for what I paid. This they don't tell you when you book your holiday!!!! I was told that the premier restaurants was the California grill in the Disneyland hotel . Two things to say about that, bad, cold food, very poor service. The character meals they sell, you expect to see a lot of them there we saw four character at one meal and three princesses at another and we had to wait over an hour to see the first princess and drank water waiting for the others as we had already eaten our meal. When I got fed up with the rubbish food I went to a deli who stated that she would not take my voucher for a cheese and ham sandwich. Eventually a manage from Walts restaurant kindly helped us out an the voucher was accepted. We ate at the Lucky nugget, they took our vouchers and explained that we would lose money by eating there we understood but had a great burger. I will say go the the Buffalo Bill dinner show that was the best!!!The trip overall was disappointing considering the cost we paid. In hindsight I would have taken her to the USA for that little extra. Don't get the premium plans there not worth it.!!!!! All in all my grand daughter had a great time and we made it as best we could but I will not go back there and would advise others to think about it before going to DISNEYLAND PARIS. I think finally that the CEO's of Disney need to get out there and sort this out. I'd have sacked a few of those bosses by now!!! Rant over",-1
"I used to love Disneyland however this place has gone downhill. I must know because we go here every year for the past 5 years and this was the worse of them all. Garbage not picked up which is so not like Disneyland. The food and service at their vendors have all gone downhill. Even the people frequenting this place are questionable. Not worth the time, money and agravation. Manh rides are always closed for mmaintenance so you do not get your money's worth.No more Disneyland for us!!!",-1
"We are visiting Paris from the US. We decided to take our 4 and 6 year old to Disneyland Paris for the day. Short feedback: This was the WORST experience we have ever had bar none at a park and it was 10X the price of some of the regional parks we visit all the time in the DC area. For starters there are really on 7 8 rides in the WHOLE place. The rides are super short   the merry go round went for 2 minutes!!!!!!!! We timed it. Took 1 hour to get on, 5 minutes for them to load us and in 2 minutes we were off! Second everything has a LONG line ... at least 90 minutes. The rides also suck! They are not that interesting... On top of all this the staff is rude and the place is dirty!Honestly this was a complete waste of time and money. Will never go again .. much better to go to the children's museum in Paris or go cart riding or sticking a fork in your eye!",-1
"THE HAPPIEST PLACE ON EARTH DON'T MAKE ME SO HAPPY ANYMORE!I have been coming to Disneyland every year for nearly 40 years now and never seen it this bad before!The family and I was at Disneyland June 24th threw the 29th the parade was going on, and we was riding the train to Main Street at around 9pm, the train let us off, and sense the Main Street Train Station don't have a wheelchair accessible ramp and the wife and I had to wait to set the stroller up at the bottom of the stairs.When we got to the bottom of the stairs we had to set up the stroller and was told we couldn't stand there in the walkway that we would have to keep moving. We told the employee, aka cast member, that we just got off the train and was setting up the stroller quickly and then we would be moving, and was told stroller or not, we would still have to move because the parade was going on and we was in the no parade watching walkway. We then told the cast member we wasn't watching the parade we was quickly setting up the stroller. She said sorry but you still have to move! We wasn't even blocking others people from walking by.Disneyland needs to train there employees, aka cast members, how to treat there guests. In the matter of 10 seconds it took to set up our stroller we had 3 cast members tell us there was no standing there. Unecceptable!!!We went to city hall to make a complaint about the parade usher cast members, we told them if they don't want people getting off the train during the parade that they should just shut the train station, and trains down during the parade. And that this was unecceptable!!! The cast member at City Hall said she agrees with us and what we are saying, but that there was nothing she could do about the parade ushering cast members. A complaint will be filed with Disneyland corporate office HR Department! ",-1
"We went to Disneyland the first week of December to celebrate my neice's birthday and to try to dull the pain of my best friend's family after the suicide of her husband. My neice Meagan was turning 21 during this trip and she wanted to do The Princess Dinner at Ariel's Grotto. We had reservations set and she decided to make it extra special, we should all dress up. We had our faces painted in the park and went back to our hotel to dress up for our reservation. We were stopped at security for almost three hours because, well they had several diferent reasons depending on which manager was talking to us. First we were told that we couldn't go on rides in our gowns. When we told them we weren't going on any rides, we had reservations at Ariel's Grotto. Then we were told that we couldn't wear formal wear in Disneyland California Adventureland. Then we were told that they only allow anyone under 10 years of age to dress up like princesses. Then we were told that there was a possible trademark infraction because we could be mistaken for their Princesses. When we reminded them that their Princesses did not have face paint and tattoos, they changed back to the no one over the age of 10 was allowed to dress up. When we reminded them that they had a shop in Disneyland that sold adult sizes of their Princess dresses. That is when we realized that Disneyland is basically a money grubbing organization that will take your money for the dresses but you will not be allowed to wear them in the same place that you bought it. This was evident when I had sent an e mail previously to inquire how the grand marshalls of the parade were chosen. I was hoping that during our 5 day visit, My 10 year old neice could possibly get to be in the parade as a way to lessen the pain of the first holidays without her father after the aforementioned suicide. I was basically accused of using the situation to get special treatment when they choose people at random. After I found out that you can get a  special  tour for $150 an hour, I finally realized that it is probably the people that spend the extra money get the  special  treatment. You would think that they make enough money charging $194 for a 5 day park hopper pass. When we reminded the management that everyone was supposed to be a child again at The Happiest Place on Earth, they finally said that they would escort us to our dinner, I am assuming so that they could keep an eye on us and make sure we didn't do other stuff while we were dressed up. That is when we had to tell them that our reservation was expired since we had to wait at security for almost 3 hours before they finally came up with this brilliant idea and that California Adventureland (where Ariel's Grotto is) was now closed. We were allowed to go to Downtown Disney to find a place to have dinner and I couldn't help but think that no one has never dressed up to go to the fancy restaurants in Downtown Disney or that we were the first people to try to dress up like princesses for the Princess Dinner? After this incident, we saw adults dressed as Alice in Wonderland, Peter Pan and Pirates and we asked them if they had been stopped at security because they were a trademark infraction or because they were over the age of 10. The answer was no, they sailed through security. Either they don't enforce there rules for other characters as much as they do for their Princesses or we must have looked better then these other people did and we were just too hot for Disney. This was the third trip in as many years that we had taken to Disneyland and needless to say our trip and her birthday were sullied by this incident and I doubt that any of us will ever go back to The Happiest Place On Earth.",-1
"Our experience began on a day that the park should have been empty.With so many rides down (piriats of the Caribbean, its a small world, finding nemo, Indiana Jones just to name a few), crowds every where, long waits, and the smell of dirty diapers, we will never go agian. At $368 $16 for parking for the family, I should have a guided tour by mickey himself. We payed $208 for 6 flags, and $178 for Knotts, a lot better deal as we got most of our rides, without crowds.",-1
"As the frequent customers of Disney Parks and admirers of the brand, we were so disappointed with Disneyland Paris. Whilst the facilities were kept clean and in good condition, we were annoyed by so many people smoking. This is probably the only Disney park in the world that allows smokers to freely smoke anywhere inside the park! (I guess they probably lose more money if they don't allow people to smoke?!?) That has spoiled our experience    we simply didn't want to queue up for anything, including the meeting with the characters.The Parks is not big but has most of the usual attractions one would see at other Disney parks. Although it was still during the 20th anniversary celebration, the shows, parades & fireworks were not that extravagant. There were so few shows when we were there.We didn't understand the crowd either    nobody seemed to be considerate of others at all. The people in front didn't bother to sit down to let others in the back see the parades or evening shows fireworks in front of the Castle. No cast members seem to be doing anything. One French guy asked his countrymen politely to sit down but they didn't bother.The only surprise we had was there was no queue for Space Mountain in the evening!Overall, we would rate it only better than Disneyland Hong Kong, which continues to be the bottom of our list of Disney Parks.",-1
"Would never go back! I am a senior and went with my six year old grandson and 34 year old daughter. We were all disappointed! Highly overrated. There was not a single ride, store, washroom that we didn't have to line up for! I expected this but did not expect the pushing and shoving and the excess number of strollers for a Thursday between 9:30 until 3:00 pm. All of us including my grandson were so glad to see the exit. I have been to Tokyo and can tell you honestly that Tokyo during rush hour has nothing on Disneyland. Truly a waste of money! Sorry but that's my opinion! I did see lots of grumpy people that looked like they were experiencing the same type of day!",-1
"Would definitely give 5 star to this magnificent park that takes you back to the time and reminds you the heroes of your childhood. Would definitely give 5 star to this magnificent park for its huge area and the big number of attractions and rides. However ..... we arrived excited at the park but left with a bittersweet taste in our lips. The reason is that most of the top rides (and not only) were under refurbishment, such as the Thunder Mesa Riverboat, Big Thunder Mountain, Pirate's Beach, Buzz Laser Blast, Space Mountain, La Cabane des Robinson, Peter Pan's flight and others. It is obvious that with so many rides being shut, resulted to huuuuuge lines for the rest attractions!!!! For example we spent around 45 minutes to one hour waiting at the queue for a 3 4 minutes ride at the Dumbo the elephant or the Autopia. Same situation at the restaurants (which we visited after 15:00 hrs to avoid the crowds) where we spent around 45 minutes to order burger and chips. From the other hand, most of the rides suitable for small kids in the Fantasyland were open (with big queues of course). Highly recommend the Tea Cups, The Petit Train de Cirque and the cruises  Le Pays des contes de fees  the  it's a small world  and of course the Pirates of the Caribbean !!! The staff was a bit disorganised with lack of common sense at some rides   at the restaurant where we had our lunch. Security is very heavy at the entrance with scanners for both visitors and their bags that makes your visit safe. Not necessary to recommend spending the whole day at the park and close the visit watching the magnificent  Disney Dreams  (around 23:00 hrs). The show contains fireworks, water fountains, laser, music and other special effects!!",-1
I think i had been ripped off... went to HK Disneyland and found that the train ride was not available and the Cinderella Castle was made up of Cardboards (upperhalf) but they still charged full price on the tickets...,-1
"I will agree that Disneyworld is the happiest place on earth. Disneyland is definately the unhappiest place on earth after fighting crowds for only a few hours. Disneyland is in dire need of customer service and reconstruction to accomodate the crowds. Each theme park in Disneyworld seems to cater to specific age groups. My son being three years old doesn't need rides that rip his teeth out of his mouth. The MGM Theme Park in Disneyworld catered to smaller rides, puppet shows and low key entertainment. The park has much more room to walk around and lots of stands to buy small items like hot dogs, pretzels, popcorn, ect. Disneyland you will find only snacks that do not contain any other item but sugar...candybars, ice cream bars, soda pop, slushes, etc. If you want real food in Disneyland expect to stand in line at the only 1 or 2 walk up grills, and expect it to be spendy for a sandwich and soda. Oh, there are other restaurants that you can sit down and enjoy a lunch, but for a family of four it will really get spendy. The nice people at Disneyworld never hassle you about your backpacks with one or two bottles of water and a few snacks for your toddler. At Disneyland it is worse that going through airport security. They will confiscate anything edible they can dig out of your bags. My advise....save up the money for flight tickets and spend your money at Disneyworld. It is worth it to visit Mickey and Friends in Florida. You will have a really good time and be treated like royalty.",-1
"We took our 2 year old and admittedly we did think she might have been too young. She was.The park was really busy, we got barged around a lot by very rude people. The wait times were crazy...even for the toddler rides. And people are allowed TO SMOKE. In the queues and generally about the place. It's absolutely revolting and frankly I don't think it's acceptable.The Disney characters were few and far between....Mickey Mouse was commanding a 45 minute wait and you couldn't take the buggy in....so that was out.The food is blistering expensive and mediocre...the staff are nice enough but have absolutely no sense of urgency to get people fed and the queues down. So you wait some more...and some more. Maybe my expectations were too high but I just found it very stressful dealing with the crowds and not being able to find anything to do that didn't require queuing....or buying Disney merchandise.Oh and if you come in December do bring a hat. It's a good few degrees colder out in the park compared to Central Paris and you'll end up paying 22 euros for a Disney one if you forget.So disappointed :0(",-1
"Today I was severely mistreated while entering Disneyland. With an e cigarette that security threatened to confiscate and not let me return into the park. Forcing me to surrender legal Juul pods and device you can buy at 7 11. The first cast member asked me if it's medically necessary. As a registered nurse, I said automatically said yes. She proceeded to tell me they will confiscate my device so I walked away.Came back and the second cast member asked what'd I do with it. I said I threw it out. He then SCREAMED at me, pointing at me, following me, threatening for me to get it out of the garbage. OUT OF THE GARBAGE!! I ran away telling him to back off.Went back and the sheriff proceeded to me and said I had to surrender my LEGAL Juul e cigarette and they will throw it away. They will not return it. He threatened me saying I will not be allowed to return into the park. Took the device and pods. I explained it was just nicotine, sold at 7 11, showed the website, and that they let people with cigarettes and lighters in the park. He took a picture of my driver's license and park ticket. He eventually gave me back the device and later realized the pods were legally just nicotine. Gave those back too.I'm very very disappointed in the mistreatment, multiple threats and harassment at Disney security. As if this was a vape with CBD oil. It's not. There are smoking areas in the park for crying out loud. This is my 4th day out of 5 days. If it weren't for my 4 year old son in a stroller, I'd never come back to this place again. A waste of an hour of my time.",-1
"If you are thinking of visiting Disneyland Paris, my advice would be: Don't!Either put away a bit more and head to Disney World in Florida, where, as well as far better weather, you get the whole Disney magic with more characters, better service and friendly staff.Or, if you're just looking for a theme park, head to one in the UK and save yourself a lot of money, time and disappointment.Unlike Disney World, Disneyland Paris is just a theme park which happens to have rides themed around Disney films. The majority of the staff are at best unhelpful and at worst downright rude and arrogant. Many of the rides were out of order or running but with many of the carriages out of service, thereby increasing the waiting time.At Disney World, my family and I were impressed with the high standards of the rides, how clean and smart they all looked, the attention to detail all around the parks. Disneyland Paris does not have this polish: many of the rides had seen better days, with chipped paint, parts not working, murky water etc. We visited Caf   Mickey, one of only 3 places you can get character meals and had a terrible experience. The characters were generally far less visible on the whole around the parks than at Disney world.In short, if you want that Disney magic, head to Disney World. If you want a great theme park with exciting rides (that are actually running), head to Alton Towers or similar. But if you want poor service, frustrating breakdowns and arrogant staff, head for Disneyland Paris.",-1
Our large party (8x adults & 6x children) travelled to Disneyland Paris on 26th December 2015 and spent two days in both of the theme parks.  We purchased our tickets ahead of time in the UK at a cost of   95 per person which is...More,-1
"After spending over $500 to get into the place we then had the pleasure of lining up in lines for a minimum of 45 mins in 35 degrees Celsius heat.  Don't waste your time, horrific day.",-1
"I was in Anaheim for a day (10am   7pm) and thought I would check it out since I love Disney so much. The food, drinks and souvenirs are definitely not worth the price they are charging. Most of the attractions i found were for young kids and the wait times for the rides were an hour or more.",-1
Yesterday my wife & I visited Disneyland   our 2nd trip in 3 months. Last Nov. 2011 we paid over $600 for 2 annual passes. Our Nov. trip was cut short because the Park closed at 6pm for a Company party. Last night in 5 hrs we were able to go on 2 rides (over 2 hours of waiting) and 1 show (World of Color: 1 1 2 hrs waiting). The lines we horrible as rides & staff were reduced. I don't know how families can afford Disney's high prices for admission and food. I read recently that Disney Parks continue to be very profitable (year after year) and their executives are getting 10's of Millions of dollars in salary and bonuses. The entry fees increase every year (gotta keep paying those HUGE bonuses). I wonder if this is what Walt envisioned for his Park????,-1
Very expensive!  Very old!  Too many people everywhere!!  Expect over 2 hour waiting everywhere and for nothing special at the end!  Very disappointed!!  Enjoy Paris instead and go to Disneyland in USA!!!,-1
"Disneyland has proven to be all about getting your money and NOT caring if you have a good time.It is no cheaper in the off season, but more rides are closed due to refurbishment. More rides were closed than what they listed on their website, and when we got there, more rides were closed than listed at the front gate.We went at 10am and were done with Disneyland by 4pm   we'd even ridden our favorite rides a couple of times.So, you can go in the off season and  maybe  have less people, but also less rides (your favorites may be closed). Or go in season and wait hours to ride the rides.We contacted Disneyland after we returned home because we had such a horrible time, and they did not care one bit. We wanted some of our money back because so many rides were closed, and Disneyland said  no . They said we could have enjoyed the rides that were actually open, so no discount. Our disappointment did not matter to them.We might go back, maybe once every ten years?",-1
"I do have an annual pass, but Disneyland is not the Disneyland of my youth, not even of my own kids youth. It is way too commercialized and I witnessed a case of racial profiling while I was in one of the stores. No apologies from ANY Disney  cast member  for their error in judgement AND then they were told they were  trespassing . Not sure, but if you accept my money to  trespass  on your property, that is more like an  invite  with a welcome because...you took my money",-1
"We had an easy journey from Kings Cross to Marne la Valee. The security was thorough and made us feel very safe. We stayed at the Newport Bay Hotel, thus allowing us to take advantage of 'magic hours' from 8am   10am. During this period, only Disneyland hotel guests may use the park. In one day, we enjoyed 6 rides (4 during magic hours and 2 with a fast pass). The Peter Pan ride was charming and imaginative   traditional Disney. So too was Small World. Buzz Lightyear was fun and I highly recommend the Mickey and the Magician show in the Walt Disney Studios   it was a lavish West End standard show which the whole family would love.This was the 25th anniversary year but large sections were closed off and there were long queues everywhere. Our express breakfast vouchers (offering a croissant, pain au chocolat, omelette burger, orange juice or hot drink) stated they were valid in 3 restaurants, but we were informed that only one restaurant (next to the Buzz Lightyear ride) was opened. We had to walk 10 minutes to the other side of the park. 6 tills were opened, all doing fast food and the same range of drinks, but we were restricted to the last 3 tills. It took half an hour to get our breakfast. The omelette burger (with egg and bacon) was ok but there were no veggie options till after 11am. Food options all over the resort are greasy and toxic. Fortunately the Star Wars themed seating area was spacious and imaginatively laid out like a lunar landscape   this cheered me up a bit.Several rides were functional, charmless and unimaginative e.g. Teacups and carousel. The atmosphere that I'd found on visits to US theme parks was lacking. I got the sense that the Disney charm found in US theme parks was being downplayed to cater to more 'sophisticated' French tastes. It gave the park a drab atmosphere   functional and mundane.During these summer holidays my family have visited Drayton Manor (inc Thomas Land and amazing zoo) theme park and CBeebies land at Alton Towers. We stayed at the child friendly resort hotels in both cases and had a wonderful experience at both. Both places had manageable queues for small children, an excellent variety of food, plenty of staff to help you and short distances between rides.I'd strongly recommend visiting the UK resorts. I can't understand why Disney didn't choose Spain (better weather and food and more child friendly).The Disney magic has been subdued in 'stylish' Paris.",-1
"We were at the Santa Fe Hotel for 2 nights which were the worst experiance that we ever had. It felt like you were living in the Geto ! There was no heat , 1 2 roll of toilet paper in the bathroom every day. Furniture looked like is was bought at a 2nd hand shop. There is no Air condition which they do advertise in there adds, but no heat either . It also looked like it was old and shot. The key system did not work right and whenI went to get another key ,that did not work at all. When I took it back and was discusted the manager went back to my room with a master key and gave me 2 more new ones and said that they must update the hotel . The parks are very clean and fun , up to Disney standards. The hotel was lousey and dirty . Whe you pay about $ 200.00 a night to stay in a hotel you don't expect this kind of treatment . I have stayed at Disney in the states about 10 times and was always satisfied above my expectation. On a scale of 1 to 10 our experiance is 1. Stayed there 10 20 and 10 21 name is James Clements",-1
"Arriving with 26 14 15 year old pupils, we were amazed that they would shut two of the feature rollercoaster rides at the same time in the height of summer. Then we found the third rollercoaster was also shut, opening only half of the day in the end. Other headline rides like Peter Pan and the train and the steamboat were all shut and Fronteirland was a building site. We teachers then tried to book a restaurant at 11 a.m. for a table for the evening. Full? We understood why when we spent 90 minutes walking round from 5 p.m. to find the first 6 or 7 restuarants closed. Every one of thise had info boards about where was open, info that was nonsense, with different restaurants on each sign, many we'd been to and found shut. The person on the end of the phone number on the signs ( ring and book a table ) told us the names of  open  restaurants, that we'd been to and were shut and seemed to think it was our fault that ones that she had listed as open were shut!! She suggested a hot dog restaurant when we were looking for a meal. We finally were forced to have a  formule . My Lasagne and Garlic bread looked and tasted like they had been reheated numerous times, foul. I took pictures, they were so bad. My collegaue had been to the park on Christmas Day when there were (understandably) significantly less visitors but every restaurant had been open apparently. I have been going to Disneyland in Florida and Paris for many years and this was so unDisney like. I saw numerous people waliking round smoking, unchallenged and there were cigarette tabs on the floor...never seen in Florida. Back to the rides, most of our pupils, seemed to enjoy some rides but ended up going back and forth between a couple because so much was shut. 2 stars, not one? The light show is still magical and those kids who had never been before did get some magic even though most of us who had been before felt sorely short changed. Not sure how many of the 26 kids will be rushing back with families in the future. I'm afraid I won't be even though I am now entering the grandkids phase of vists now",-1
"I should preface this review by confessing that I don't like rides and I'm not a Disney fan... but we were in Paris and my daughter really wanted to go to Disneyland. We booked tickets online in advance (an absolute necessity to prevent queuing) and arrived on a Saturday by RER. Honestly I wanted to like the experience but from the moment we arrived it was very clear that this was a retail experienced we had paid 55 euros each to enjoy! Upon clearing the gates you arrive in a town square which is really code for shopping centre. There was many stores, but most sold the same low quality, over priced goods. We found the prices very similar to Canadian prices but in Euros. For example we bought a mug that would have been $12 in the Disney store for 12 euros. We asked for a box and protective packaging which could not be provided. Based on reviews of friends and family who have visited other Disney sites I was expecting to be wowed by the cleanliness and efficiency of the operation. This was not the case. The park seemed rundown and dirty. The bathrooms were filthy and stank.I was also looking forward to some of Disney's famous guest experience provided by Crew Members. This was not in evidence. In fact, there were very few staff members that were not working retail or operating the rides. There really was not much on offer unless you were interested in rides. We did see a parade which was very manufactured, not very well choreographed and frankly uninspired. Food selections were not appealing and overpriced. We went on two rides (one line moved quickly the other one was slow) and did a lot of walking around. No one was wowed.My daughter had a nice day but she won't be bothering me to take her to Florida anymore. I had expected more from Disney. I can't understand why the brand is famous for customer service based on this experience.",-1
"Paris Disney staff seem to have forgotten it's the happiest place on earth. Few ever cracked a smile or said hello in the three days we (me, husband and 3 kids aged 9,7 and 7) where there  they need to pick up their game. The park is lovely to look at and the rides are much the same as the other Disney parks of course, but the magic is definitely missing. Almost every ride we went on broke down at some point and the queues were crazy, much longer than they ought to be mainly due to staff not loading boats cars properly and letting some go a quarter full   ridiculous and frustrating. Meeting the characters at the park is almost impossible, unless you organise yourself with military precision   which I suggest you do. Find out where the characters are going to be and map put your day accordingly. The biggest disappointment was meeting a Princess at the Princess pavilion. You must start queuing at around 10am to reserve a spot to see one. After waiting in line for an hour, you'll be given a window of time to go back. That's when they tell you you can't choose a princess and you get who you get which is fine, I guess. When you return for your window   expect to wait in line again for another hour and a half. And what do you get at the end of all that? Two minutes with CInderella (or whoever). She says hello, poses for a photo and that's it! 2 minutes!! You get longer with the characters at dinner in the Disneyland Hotel. Also NO FROZEN PRINCESSES! The biggest grossing Disney movie of all time that has every little girl I know wanting to be Elsa or Anna  but neither of them is in sight. There's a Frozen float in the parade   so they have the actors and the costumes  how hard could it be to wheel them out??!! This is a major stuff up on Disneyland's part. Frozen merchandise was also hard to find, with desperate mums seen searching high and low in vain for an Elsa costume or an Olaf or Sven plush toy The saving graces  the parade (always a winner) and the light show fireworks   but expect to stay up late, it doesn't start until 11pm. The food is extremely average, like most theme park food, and the queues for even a coffee or water or outrageous. Staff are slow and inefficient. I recommend eating at Hakuna Matata in Adventure Land before 1pm. It has decent kids meals. Overall, I would take any US Disneyland over this one any day. At least the queues come with a smile.",-1
The park was really nice with lots to offer. Unfortunately visiting the park during peak summer season is really insane. The lines are really long averaging a one hour wait. Even though all of the amenities and service provided are top notch you will will not get to enjoy it because of the huge masses of people in the park. Visiting the park during off season is a whole different kind of story.,-1
"Came with 6 year old nephew. Presently staying in the NY hotel which is dated and warn, which is pretty much the same as the park. Warmth of staff and interest in guests is minimal. Compared to the states or Asia for that matter not really a Disney experience.",-1
"I totally agree with Charlie1uk. We know the value of the pound is bad at the moment, but I object to have to pay at least DOUBLE just to be in Disney. What a complete RIP OFF! They have you there and they know it!POSITIVES: The kids enjoyed it   they would would'nt they! The charachters on the whole were very good. The pre booked dinners with the Characters were good especially Cafe Mickey, and the Prince Princesses at lunchtime (both pre booked as a package). Hotel OK  The Sequoia  rooms OK fairly comfortable, descent beds. Warm and air con good!NEGATIVES: Disneyland is a Massive Rip off! Everything you buy is over double the cost of in England and I thought that was bad enough!   70 to park at Ashford for 4nights 5days! Train station at Disneyland freezing and some staff are ignorant! Don't go in March as its just an icy cold concrete metal jungle! Freezing freezing cold! Have to pay for some public toilets! Fast food which we had to wait for for ages was cold, basic crap and double or more the cost of back home! Rather starve during the day than eat some of the cold nasty stuff they serve you up at the fast food outlets! We were late checking in and some staff seemed please they could  tell us off for being late ! and when you look around smiling at each other looking totally smug! Ignorant some of them! especially when your rushing with 3 kids and suitcases!! Sequoia Pool is terrible, freezing (thats the indoor pool) dangerous steps, dirty Jacuzzi with too many people and kids in   one unhygienic mess! and the staff just ignore you in general. Safety aspect terrible! The changing rooms are very small compared to the size of the place   just terrible. Looks good in the brochure : dont be fooled! Probably more negative stuff if I had the time. Hopefully my kids and grand kids won't temp me into going again just to see their smily happy faces when they meet the Characters! Hopefully someone might read this who will look into the rip off side of most things!",-1
"While the long lines at the park are famous, apparently horrible and rude service is a standard at the hotel too.",-1
"All the usual issues   45 min queues for 3 min rides   but the real issues today were the huge number of closed rides and terrible restaurant service. Lunch: a queue of about 6 people in front of me took 45 minutes to get served (hot dogs, nuggets and chips and a pre made boxed salad  nothing in any way complicated on the menu). Ice cream kiosk had 8 people queuing. 3 staff inside doing waffles, whipped ice cream and drinks. 30 minutes to get served. No effort to interest in serving people fast and efficiently. Restaurants closed before 7pm even though the park is open until 11, but that wasn't included in the information leaflet . All in all a very disappointing day which was mostly spent queuing.",-1
"This review is about Disneyland Park Paris, not Disneyland Studio Paris which is marginally better.We were very disappointed with our visit. The park had our expectations high yet we have had much better experiences at theme parks that cost 1 6th as much as this did, literally. The entrance alone was 400 Euros. The food is overpriced so much that it is outrageous.The park is outdated, dirty, and old. As one other post wrote, it is past its use by date. The motor car ride had mechanics on duty repairing card constantly, on the fly, and there were traffic jams caused by several broken down cars. For goodness sakes buy new motors after 20 years and fix it. The Buzz Lightyear ride broke down 4 times while we were on it! 4 times, I kid you not! The only new stands are the 4001 souvenir shops that are everywhere. The rides are few and far between. None of them are of the quality we expect after visiting parks such as Legoland (Germany), Warner Bros World (Aust), Wet   N   Wild, Seaworld or even Luna Park in Sydney which must be older than Disneyland. The wait is intolerable, not just for rides but also food and tickets. The staff are on the whole where rude and only there for their own social life with other staff. The exception were the grounds staff who diligently picked up the litter dropped by thoughtless people. Many of the rides were broken. We were there for a full day. We rode for about 10 minutes. We queued for about 6 hours. The toilets were disgusting; old and dirty.Although there is a policy in small writing not to smoke in the main areas this is not followed through and the cigarette smoke is outrageous, especially that the main customers there are very young children.This park should be boycotted by the general public. It is a disgrace and outrageously overpriced.Save your money and go to Surfers Paradise in Queensland.",-1
Our visit to the Euro Disney was not as expected.It were too many people in the park. The wait for the attractions were 1 to 2 hours. Fast pass is simply unfair. Long distances make it quite impossible to calculate the time ... The children of 7 and 11 was DISAPPOINTED and day 2 we went around and just looked at the queues in the Walt Disney Studio. Finally we went back to the hotel. It was not what we had paid lot of money for.It was very disappointing. There should be something done to improve conditions for visitors! Regards 4 disappointed people from Norway on a visit to Euro Disney,-1
Too crowded. Just getting around the park was difficult. Popular rides were booked out by 1 2pm and all other rides had huge queues. Couldn't find many characters either.  Very expensive day and so sad to say....not enjoyable.,-1
"We booked Disneyland Paris in January 2014 and were really looking forward to taking our 6 and 2 year old children. We had built it up to them for the last 4 months about how great it would be but it has been a big disappointment of a holiday. We stayed at explorers hotel which is a partner hotel. We enjoyed it more here playing in the pool! After our first day at the park none of us wished to go back there. You have to queue for everything, at 1 point the waiting time for 1 of the rides was 2 hours! We imagined the characters would be walking around the parks for picture opportunities etc but they only came out at certain times and points in the parks for a limited time leading to queues for pictures. As previous reviews have stated there are a lot of smokers in the parks which did bother me. We had a 4 day park pass but only spent around 10 hours in the parks as it was just a waste of energy. There are lots of toy shops in and around the parks selling the same gear and it is nothing special and is expensive. Food: if you love junk food this place is fantastic! As that's all you will get. In the end we took a train to Paris and visited all the major tourist attractions via the metro and all in all this was the best part of the holiday. The kids said they loved seeing the Eiffel Tower and walking around Paris. The funniest part for me was watching people turn to wild stone age people when queuing for a shuttle bus like they had never seen one. You could be stood at the bus stop for 10minutes waiting patiently with no one else around then 30 or 40 people turn up and just barge and push past one another to make sure they get on the bus and then when on the bus run to ensure they get seated for the massive 5 minute bus journey. Also people with prams not folding them up to make space for other passengers. We had a pram and folded it up no problem. 1 evening after watching people fight their way onto the bus we decided to walk back to the hotel which was around a 40 minute walk (with kids and pram). All in all Paris was fantastic, explorers hotel was average but the pool was great and kids enjoyed going in there everyday. Disneyland Paris was rubbish as were the majority of people who turn into morons. This has put me off ever going to Florida.",-1
"We paid full price while 16 !! attractions were closed for renovation. Also restaurants were closed, so it took us 1,5 hours to wait for our food... It was sunny and warm, one would expect all icecream shops would be open, h  las! Waiting hours were sometimes 220 minutes, which is expected when 1 3 of all attractions is closed! Fast pass check in for the same day had to be arranged before 11am, no possibilities to use your fast pass for the next day. To know about the renovated attractions, you have to dig deep on their website. Expensive, crowded and dissapointing, those were the main impressions of all our family.",-1
"Visited Easter 2015, 7 rides were closed, Technical issues was the saying of the holiday.  If you eat at the Blue Lagoon make sure they cook your Chicken properly.",-1
If you have older children they will be very disappointed as all but 2 rides were closed. Waste of money. Expected so much more. They should not be allowed to charge full price. Total rip off!!!,-1
"having been to california and florida many times we kind of thought we knew what to expect.....how wrong we were! the staff where appauling, rude and innatentive, a very laissez faire attitude to the paying customers and boy did we pay! i cant remember being anywhere this expensive over 3 euros for a coke and about the same for water. on the plus side the weather was good! The worst point about the park and i cant blame disney for this was just how rude the french guests were, they have never heard of queuing and the fight to get to the front was beyond belief and the the fact they do not care makes it even worse. I'm an ex rugby player but viewing parades was akin to some of the toughest scrums ive ever been in. the park staff just stood and watched like it was a sport of some kindon a number of occaisions we heard the park staff muttering under there breath, and in general it was the older park staff, not the younger ones. luckily i do speak some french which proved invaluable as there was a real reticence to engage with customers. My top tip is dont go, save up a bit and go to florida or california where the experience is so much better and will leave happy lasting memories whereas disneyland paris left a bad taste and an empty bank account!",-1
"We have been to Paris Disneyland before, our last being a few years ago. We have enjoyed each visit, would not hesitate to return and we were looking forward to our first visit with grandchildren.We were there for 4 nights from 10th 14th April and experienced same disappointments each day, rides continously breaking down, long queues for everything with people pushing in and not enough staff (especially weekends), many have no interest and bad attitude.The children loved the characters when you could find them but there was no organisation for photos and signatures with everyone pushing their children to get in first and then they would leave with no warning.If you plan to go with small children then 2 nights is enough and keep them to weekdays, keep patient and keep smiling although this will be a challenge at times. If you can spend some time beforehand to be familiar with the parks with what you would like to do then this will help save some time but unless you want to pay for all day fastpass then you can only have one fastpass at time and depending on demand the time between getting the pass and using it could be up to 3 to 4 hours. We planned our last ride on Thunder Mountain with fastpass before returning home and when we got there it had broken down!! The brochures and adverts make it to be a magical place but this Disneyland has lost it's magic. I have written to Disneyland customer care (?) but not holding my breath for a reply.",-1
"The park was extremely crowded. Adding to the frustration was that Disney was operating some rides at half capacity, resulting in epic long lines. Food was mediocre and incredibly overpriced. 30 minute minimum wait for a sit down dining experience. Very trashy guests (locals?) were on their smartphones during dark rides, ruining the experience. Had a 3 day park hopper ticket. After 4 hours left and flew home 2 days early because Disneyland was such a bust.",-1
"We took our children to Euro Disney about 24 years ago and had a good time. We returned on 20th February with our grandson after a long drive from London. A total waste of time and money. It is now a complete rip off and should be avoided. One hour, 20 minute queue for a 3 minute ride on the flying Dumbos (3 of the 16 pods out of commission). Best attractions such as Pirates of the Caribbean   Madhatter   s teacups closed (   for your future enjoyment   ). Most refreshment outlets closed. Only place to get warm was in the shops     all of them open! People were sitting on the ground outside the shops eating chips in the freezing cold. Despite advance tickets on a Times promotion you had to queue for an hour even to get into the park (only one window in three open). Attitude of staff:    We know it   s rubbish. We don   t care. We only work here. it   s not our fault   . On top of everything, no sign of Donald Duck or the others in the gang . . . the one thing our grandson had been promised. In the UK we probably would have a case for suing them for misrepresentation.",-1
"Dear all,Let me make the process clear. If u r in receipt of PIP DLA or have an access card Disability rail card you CAN get a carer ticket in for free BUT.1. Buy your full price ticket online first about    392. Take that ticket to the disabled ticket stall on left hand side with yr disabled railcard or PIP letter etc amd THEN you will get a free carer pass.DO NOT follow the rubbish guidance on disney site as yesterday we got stung for    72 euro entry for 1 plus a free carer as we bought at the gate.NOW   take your tickets to CITY HALL and ask for a special disabled.pass. This allows you fast access to all.the rides via the exit, with hardly any standing or waiting. This is a family ticket so you can all get quick entry. This is a SPECIAL pass NOT a fast pass which u have to pay for. The SPECIAL pass is free.Note: the carpark is    20. Yes I said it correctly. Head to Disneyland Hotel. Show your disability parking permit when u purchase your car.park ticket, they will give u a ticket with a code on for disability parking which is a stones throw from the park.Extra note: if it is raining the disney.characters dont come out and light parades cancelled and rides shut. They don't care at all and it does not feel very disney at all. Don't go in the rain.Cheeseburger was    22!! Yep. But found pizza place that does a Royale Pizza, side salad big coke and fruit salad. This is    15 for the deal but we thought it would feed to adults. As if u stay.in park until close u r gonna have to eat twice really.Money saving tip:  when u go and see Mickey for a formal.pic, they will take a picture using yr.mobile if u ask or alternatively like any photo taken on a ride you can take a picture of it with yr phone for FREE and is just as good.Its a money grabbing pit. The toilets were diagusting and I mean disgusting. Can not believe this was such an expensive park. I have visited eurodisney when it.opened 25 years ago, on 15th anni.amd yesterday. It has NOT.changed at.all from 25 years ago. There r hardly any signposts which annoyed me. There is another park which you.can pay an additional    5 for. If u have been before to original park I would recommend the new one. Will i go again? Im 45 now so probably not. The rides etc r so much better at Alton Towers or Chessington. With no disney.characters around and rain we should have stayed at home.",-1
It took 30 minutes in line and there were only 5 groups of people ahead of us ticket sellers make no effort whatsoever to get people thru...really aggravating startOk I come here every 5 years or so. Every time I visit it seems too many of the big rides are closed.Matterhorn and Indiana Jones were both closed this tripI would have thought that the food would have improved but Oh no ...its just as bad as ever   really horribleIts something that you should see but really the shine has worn off for me Oh and the tickets are $100,-1
"Paid a tidy sum for one day park hopper tickets. So glad that was all the money I wasted.How can it be claimed that this is the happiest place on earth?From the minute you enter the park   staff who search your bags. Well, they open them, cast a cursory glance inside and then wave you through. Do they have a clue what they're looking for or, like other Disney cast members, are they just playing the part?Wait to get in. Wait to get out. Waiting times well in excess of an hour for most of the rides. Fast pass tickets exhausted for most rides. Broken down rides. Rip off food and drink prices. Screaming, fractious kids   who are NOT having a happy time. Parents who haven't a clue how to control them. Disney staff who herd the crowds like animals. Actually, many behave worse than animals and I lost count how many times I ripped into cheats who jumped the lines. Yep, spend sixteen hours in Disneyland and for your efforts get to experience half a dozen or so rides and a couple of stage shows. Come out feeling seriously swindled of your money, stiff and sore from standing in lines and with the mother of all headaches from the never ending noise.Do yourselves a favour. Experience Disney in Florida where the parks are bigger and better equipped to deal with the massive number of visitors. For health and safety reasons alone, there should be a maximum limit on the number of guests admitted to the parks. Never again.",-1
"My husband had a small soft bouncy ball my son had and was playing with prior to our departure from our resort before we boarded the shuttle to pass time. We took this into the park 3 times before the last time security took it out of my husbands backpack and said we had to    surrender it or take it to the car.    Because we took the shuttle, the car wasn   t an option. The security officer then went on to say that if we were caught in the park with a ball, we could be escorted out of the park. My son was so upset over this. He had just gotten that ball when we arrived in California. Keep in mind Disney sells balls very similar to the one my son brought in, it just didn   t have a mickey face on it. I was told that the reason they allow sales and possession of these same types of balls in the park was because    they   ve been checked over.    My son had not once taken that ball out of my husbands bag. He just had it to play with prior to us arriving to Disneyland. The chamber of commerce cast member did absolutely nothing with my complaint. The only person who truly cared was a cast member named Nina who was working in the guardians area on the night we were there. Thank god she was working, because she gave us a voucher for my son to use to replace the ball that was taken from him. She was kind and sweet and let me vent my frustrations about our experience with Disney. She was wonderful. She was the positive light in our day. When we were leaving the park we were told by the security officers that the    bin    (this is where they put all of the items they confiscate from their guests) is essentially off limits and will not be available for guests nor will they hold the item they take to be picked up at the end of the day. When I asked where they take all of the toys they take from these kids, I was told the trash compactor. Can you believe this??? A billion dollar company not even willing to donate the items they   ve wrongly taken. What is a small bouncy ball going to do Disney? I can see if it was out and being played with or causing disruption. But to take it because it   s considered sporting equipment (they have listed on their prohibited items online things like    helmets, baseball bats, hockey sticks) no where does it say bouncy balls. Come on Disney. Unbelievable. You won   t have to worry about escorting my family out of your park. We won   t be back. Also, half of their rides at California adventure park are being repaired or maintenanced so just be aware of that when you go as well. If a ride breaks down and guests had a fast pass to that ride, they   ll allow them to choose another ride (which is nice but not necessarily fair to the other guests who had a FASTPASS to the line with a ride working) so we waited 35 minutes to get on our fast pass ride. This situation went far beyond the $5 ball. We got my son another one. It   s the principle. We were treated as though we brought in a weapon.. and then told this    weapon    we brought was going in the    bin    and then to the trash with all of the other innocent not harmful items taken from kids. I appreciate security and what they do to keep everyone safe. I truly do. I respect their efforts, however, this was asinine and uncalled for. This was the item security found to be a threat and dangerous enough to get you escorted out of their park. Be on the lookout for these balls when you go and by all means DO NOT bring them to the park unless you want a heartbroken child and it put in the    bin   . They are hazardous and prohibited. Terrifying little thing isn   t it? ",-1
"The happiest place on earth? Really?They allow TOO MANY people into the park, so many that you can't even walk. 3 hour waits for rides seems like very poor management.The thing that really made this particular trip a BAD experience was the bathrooms. A person should not have to clean a toilet so that they can use it, especially after paying TONS of money for the privilege.I found the staff to be particularly brusque. Once again, I paid TONS of money to be there, staff should be polite and professional.If I ever return to Disneyland, it will be against my will.",-1
This place is beautiful. Everybody knows. Kids love it. We love it. All the attractions are engeniered up to the smallest detail. But what if than you are swept away by a crazy crowd that throws garbage eveywhere and screems and push an you have to line up for ages before you can access to anything? Where is the magic going than??? ,-1
"Have just come back and have to say will NEVER be visiting again!!!! This is my 6th time over Christmas, the last being 3 years ago and you are totalling ripping off your customers and guests!!! 6 euro for a hotdog that is extortionate!! Unfortunately you have the monopoly and people have to pay. Not everyone has the ability to pay these prices. Disneyland is a magical place but not at these prices. There are not enough staff to manage the rides nor at the restaurants in Disney Village, you cannot accommodate the volume of people visiting it's about time you think of your guests and not your profits!!!",-1
"I worked in South Florida for eight years and the work required me to visit Disney and other theme parks in Orlando on several occasions...so I knew they weren't my cup of tea! We took our grandchildren to LA last week and felt obliged to shell out $400 for Disney Park tickets. What a shambles. The park is clean, the personnel are professional and pleasant and the rides work if you can get on them...but you can't. Standing in giant line ups we were surrounded by piped music, exposed to broiling sun and the less than charming aroma of fast food.I accept that millions of people seem to enjoy this although I am at a loss to understand why, so I will buy shares in Disney but I will never go back!",-1
We went to euro Disney while on a family holiday from Australia. All my daughter wanted to do for her birthday was to go to Disney. We went all 9 of us and were shocked at how terrible it was. Long delays many rides not even working ( which we weren't told as we paid) Smoking parents everywhere. Hands down the worst day of our European holiday. My sad little girl left after being on 2 dud rides quoting   Never go to Disney it ruins childhood dreams ,-1
"Really disappointed to have to give such a low rating, but the severe overcrowding that takes place completly spoils the visit. Everybody expects long queues at Disney, but the huge crowds even make it difficult to walk around the park and it felt unsafe at times. Have waited for this trip for so long, but left feeling very deflated.",-1
My family went here on early May and nearly half of the rides were closed for routine maintenance getting ready for the summer season. Not only was this disappointing for the kids and adults alike but there was no discount in the entry fee. As so many rides were closed the ones that were open were overcrowded with huge waiting times.,-1
"I have never written a review before so I don't really know where to start......... This was our annual holiday this year. We did come over three years ago in February and we had a nice time this week was a completely different story...We stayed at the Davy Crockett Ranch which was actually nice, very dark but clean and local to the park. I guess it went downhill from there.We have a disabled son so knew that we could get a pass in 'City Hall' which would enable us to access the rides easier. After a 35 minute queue a lady took our details and before handing over the pass decided to ask and tick off a range of boxes that applied to our sons needs; 'is he mentally deficient?' She asked. I'm sure there are more sensitive and more appropriate ways to address this. You would think the pass would make our life easier... We were wrong. After fighting the crowds to get to The pirate ride we were told that we needed to book a time slot   we did this for four hours later (the earliest slot they had) and fought our way back through the crowds to Thunder mountain for my eldest daughter   that wasn't working so then to Space Mountain   we collected the fast pass and went to the buzz lightyear ride   we waited 40 minutes at the disabled gate, a Disney Customer Service Rep walked by and asked us if she could help   I explained what we were waiting for and she replied with ' I'm not on this section so I can't help you!' I could go on about the fact that Space Mountain then broke down, the fact that a Disney Rep pushed our wheelchair out the way to make space for another family so we couldn't see the parade, the disgusting toilets, the rude staff and the fact that even when you ask people not to blow spoke in your sons face they then do it again on purpose, the way we were told to make our way to the disabled seats through a crowd of people sitting on the floor in Playhouse Disney without any help, the way we were told to hurry up off the slinky dog ride as we were holding up the queue (not easy with a 7 years old who can't walk), I could go on, but you get the picture.Having been to both Florida and California I find it hard to believe that they are in the same company as euro disney   it needs a whole new fresh management system and someone who is customer service orientated driving it forward.We won't be going back ever again.",-1
"So, we were foolish enough to try this park again, I guess we love the punishment. The staff were RUDE when we asked why all the rides were broken and were offered a free fastpass with way outrageous as we were leaving the park. We were to be contacted by management, never were and I believe that is the real issue here, poor management. Walt Disney would be screaming if he found out how the family runs this park today. 80% of the rides were broken and we were told, this doesn't happen often and is not acceptable, but then offer nothing after you have paid 100 dollars per person. Funny thing is in 2014 we were here and all the rides were also broken, I doubt we picked lucked out both times,this is an ongoing problem. Now compare this to Disneyworld in Florida and it's night and day, we were there 3 times now and no issues with rides or other problems. This park needs to get it together and get things operating correctly, it costs too much to be constantly disappointed. As for us this is absolutely the last time, Universal Studios was SO much better and nothing was broken. WAKE UP MANAGEMENT !",-1
"Visited Disney 2 days 2 parks and very disappointed with Disney experience. I had read up before hand that some attractions were closed for refurbishment but to be there and find things that were supposed to be open cancelled and temporarily closed was unacceptable. Staff were extremely rude and not feeling the Disney magic at all, in fact they all looked miserable. All in all it was a very unforgettable trip (but in a bad way) and a very expensive one at that too! I have emailed Disney itself with no reply it   s very unprofessional. Disneyland Paris does not live up to the Disney trademark it sells.",-1
"My wife, I and 8 year daughter visited on a Wednesday in June from 8 AM   10 PM. It was Grad Night, so there were a lot of high school kids in the park. I'm sure there were more across the way at California Adventure since there are more thrill rides there. I strategically picked this day because it was a black out date for annual pass holders and the magic morning (one hour early arrival for Disneyland resort guests) was at California Adventure that day. Still, the crowds were ridiculous. Everyone sidewalk was packed, every line for each ride was long, and even the lines to eat very mediocre and over priced food were long. If you want a good view of one of the free parades or shows, you have to arrive an hour early and sit. We had fast passes to Fantasmic (wonderful show by the way), but the view was not that great and arriving earlier and getting one of the expensive dinner packages would have provided better views. After the 9 PM Fantasmic show, we tried to see the 9:30 PM fireworks, but they basically roped off the better viewing areas on Main Street (because it is packed and they let tons of people into the park in the evening just to view the fireworks), so there was nowhere for us to stand to watch the fireworks because they kept saying  you can't stand there  and we basically got ushered out of the park because there was nowhere else to go. On top of the that, there was a glitch in the fireworks show, and it stopped shortly after it began and never finished. And then the number of rides that were not available was annoying as well. In the morning, Space Mountain, Splash Mountain, and the Haunted Mansion were all not available. Peter Pan's flight and Innoventions were both out the entire day and the Storybook Land Canal boats were out most of the afternoon. We were able to get Fastpass to ride Space Mountain and the Haunted Mansion. We obtained the Space Mountain Fastpass at noon and had to return at 4:25 pm to go on the ride. Splash Mountain only opened up later in the afternoon and by the time I came by, the wait was 120 minutes and there were out of Fastpasses. We did enjoy a handful of the rides, most notably the Jungle Cruise, Pirates of the Caribbean, It's a Small World, and the Disneyland Railroad. The park is very clean for the number of people that go through it and we still had some memorable moments. That being said, for $100 ticket, I don't feel I got my money's worth. I do recommend you arrive at the time they open because you can at least go on a few rides without long waits. The Matterhorn is probably a good ride to start with since they do not offer Fastpasses and the lines were very long. Here is a great site for planning: http:  www.disneytouristblog.com ",-1
"Disneyland paris is an utter rip off.Last night we were charged 5 euros for 2 small glasses of milk for our granchildren.Meal at Sequioia lodge 137 eurosMeal at disneyland hotel 138 eurosYes there were characters but we had to pay ectra for drinks egpint of lager and galss of chardnnay 12.90eurosGift for my five year old grand daughter   little doll set   16,90 euros (same in pound shop in Scarborough   1)Lunchtime meal for 4 of us rather like a macdonalds 38 eurosthey charge for everything   towels for pool 2 eurosVery disappointedEven at this time of year massive queueswaiting time in park for rides and meals normally 20 mins   sometimes longerBe prepared Two baileys whiskies 20 euros",-1
"Excellent day out marred only by the park's non observance of its own No Smoking Policy. This clearly states that smoking is only permitted in a few designated areas, yet people were openly smoking in the caf  s as well as elsewhere. When I asked a lady on the table next to me at an ice cream parlour to extinguish her cigarette, as we had children with us (as did others), she briefly agreed before taking it up with a member of staff who told her it was fine to smoke there. I raised this with the member of staff who claimed ignorance of the park's stated policy.I have tried to raise this with the park management via the feedback form on their website, but this does not work as it will not accept UK postcodes for some reason.I have emailed the Disneyland Paris webmaster twice to ask them to fix the website and pass my complaint on to the appropriate department, and nobody has yet responded or acknowledged my message.Up till now my many experiences of Disney (in Paris, Florida and LA), its efficiency and customer service have been excellent. I am very sad to have to revise my opinion.Stephen Maddock",-1
"Oh dear, where do I start ?Stayed at Hotel New York for 3 nights between Xmas and New Year and found the hotel ok   our room was on the ground floor facing the ice rink and although there was music played for the skaters to skate too, we could hardly hear it from our room. The room itself was tatty with wallpaper peeling away everywhere and with a few areas of graffiti which seemed to be the work of an over excited child   the bathroom was again ok, but the sealant around the bath seemed to be mouldy, the grout in need a good scrub and the wallpaper needing replacing. We only had one evening meal, in the Parkside restaurant, which was a disappointing all you can eat buffet   the only half decent component was the lamb   the 'beef' meatballs did not taste like beef and there were too many fish dishes. The only hot vegetables were french beans and small potatoes ! At 32 euros for an adult and 17 for a child, this seemed expensive but then that's typical throughout Disney Parks . . . oh and 5 euros for a can of coke   fanta is ridiculously overpriced (the adult meals do not include drinks !)Onto the parks . . . the days we visited it seemed the 'extra magic hours' were pointless   Space Mountain didn't open until 9, Big Thunder Mountain was shut so there was little value in the extra hour whatsoever ! MGM Studios faired even worse   we spent 1.5 hours queuing for Crush's coaster to then be told that there was a fault on the ride . . . off we trudged to the Studio Tour where we waited for 60 minutes to be told that there was a fault with the main attraction and therefore the ride had to close. To experience one disappointment after waiting for so long is bad, but to experience 2 is unacceptable, especially when you have 2 young children who have waited patiently   it's these little people who remember most, and we left the park at 11am as crowds were ridiculously busy and ride wait times were a minimum of 100 minutes . . . so, having spent the best part of 350 Euros for the days tickets, all we had was 2.5 hours of waiting in queues to show for it   not great value for money !!!!We left Paris vowing to never return and the children left deeply disappointed and upset that they could not enjoy what should have been a fun vacation   their lasting memory will be that they could never achieve the fun which they had set out to experience . . . as adults, our lasting memory will be that brand Disney is falling way short of the expectations it should be setting itself, and we saw a side which is glaringly apparent that the company is reaping huge amounts of profits, on overpriced goods without the necessary re investment.We will NEVER return",-1
"I've been to Disneyland Paris 3 times before and both California and Florida. Unfortunately Paris is now a very poor relation to the American Parks. The parks claim to be non smoking but people smoke everywhere and the staff just ignore them. We had to move twice while waiting for the parade because people started smoking next to our children. The customer service is mediocre at best. As an example of this my daughter had a birthday badge at California last year and all the staff said happy birthday and the entertainers sang to her (magical). This year we only got 2 happy birthdays all day and very few of the staff break into a smile for anything. There is a severe lack of characters. When I first went about 10 years ago there were Disney characters everywhere including the restaurants. I counted 3 in the whole of Hollywood studios, which doesn't even have a parade any more and the Frozen parade in the main park consisted of a single horse and carriage. The shows are nowhere near as good as the American counterparts. While the kids enjoyed the Frozen sing along the production values are basic (bring back Tarzan) and nothing like Aladdin (California) or Lion King or Belle (Florida). In short if you want a great Disney experience save the extra money and go to the USA. I can't say the kids didn't have fun it's just that it could be so much better with a little effort and the odd smile. ",-1
"This place was such a rip off. I completely understand they need to make a buck or two, but this was beyond the pale. We went with 2x 8 year old boys and they were quite bored. The only decent rides that were there were a 40 minute wait. You have to be so patient as all the rides require a lengthy wait. They were too short for the main ride they wanted to go on. If you have deep pockets, this place is totally up your alley. Be totally prepared to keep putting your hand in your pocket all day long. The U.S. Disney theme parks are much better.",-1
"We were just in Disneyland Paris on a Monday in August. The whole experience was a disappointment from beginning to end. To get into the park took at least 45 minutes, in three very disorganized queues first to go through security, then to get tickets, then to get into the park. The main problem with Disney is that it's far too crowded, at least in the summer. The park is much smaller that its Florida counterpart, so with so many people milling about it's hard just to maneuver the walkways. Obscenely long lines. And nearly every line had a line jumper! Park not as clean as in Florida, and the staff certainly not as friendly. Just before 6:00 p.m. my husband waited in line for fish and chips at Toad Hall restaurant. When he arrived at the counter, at 5:58, the manager literally closed the door in his face and said,  We're closed.  He was the last one in line and they could have easily closed the door after serving him. We had a crappy sandwich for dinner someplace else instead. Now the the good: the rides were all fun, especially It's a small World, the Fairy Tale boat ride, Pirates of the Caribbean. And the parade at 7:15 was great. But nearly all lines were 30 minutes or more; we averaged only one ride per hour. However, although I did not enjoy the day, my kids definitely did. They have good memories, so it wasn't a complete waste. I'll never go back to DPL. Stick to Disney in Florida or other locales.",-1
"if you are disabled, or with a disabled person, this is nothing like Disney USA, in Paris they don't care. You have to get a pass from City Hall to show you are  special  which we were told you show and will be escorted to the appropriate entrance for each ride, there are no bookings. Ride 1' Buzz Lightyear, standing next to the disabled access sign, we were told there was no entry for disabled, I pointed at the sign, only to be told,  we are too busy...  Ride 2, Pirates of the Caribbean, you can can in if you have booked a reservation, not what we were told at City Hall,  they are wrong... You have to book.  So no ride here either. Finally, Ride 3, It's a small world,  do you have a reservation?   No, where do I book?   here at 8 am tomorrow.   But the park doesn't open until 9!  Glum look from unhelpful staff.For the Wild West Show, we checked what the arrangements were for disabled guests, we were advised to be there promptly at the 5:30 pm opening and we would be assisted. At the appointed time we arrived, to be told to wait next to a open door in a windy passage until 6:20 pm when everyone else was in, then we had to find a different person to finally take use to a dir rent place to get our seats. Again, terrible customer service and support. By the way a great show and great food, terrible event staff, even after checking and following their advice.So no help, no support, no friendliness, no caring attitude and customers who obviously just get in the way. We never intend to come back as these are the most uncaring staff ever.By way of a footnote, our hotel staff at the Sequoia Lodge were excellent model Disney staff, as they should be.",-1
"Oh where to start, I will admit I am not a theme park enthusiast, but I am a team player and the husband and small boys love them, so I play along. But to say I loathe this place after our latest visit would be an understatement.This is our fourth visit in three years....I have never been a fan but my distaste is strong.Our biggest change and disappointment was the discontinuation of the former DAS program while there are still minor accommodations for those wanting to enjoy the park with disabilities it is a far reach one size fits all pass, that only applies to rides with current fast pass availability. Many of those rides are not the ones young children would seek out. We end up riding Astro Blasters all day because it's the most accommodating. This program could be better suited as a tiered program where the adjustments are made based on need. Physical disabilities require different accommodations than mental disabilities.The overall line durations were in the 45 90 minute range this is unacceptable in my opinion when paying over $100 per ticket per person per day. If at the park for 10 hours and you stop to eat overpriced, close to expired food twice in that day you might luck out and hit 7 rides that last less than 2 minutes each.The food is lousy, (excluding the fried chicken) they have no refillable drink cups despite the fact other theme parks in California do (they cite health regulations when I asked), so your spending $3 $4 minimum per drink. Food line ups are long and you can bank on $60 to feed a family of 4.Then there is my biggest peeve of all, rude staff and that damned parade! I take huge issue with Disney encouraging people to line up 2.5 hours Before the Parade. They rope off huge areas and drive the masses through 6' pathways that include wheelchairs, strollers, excited kids and grumpy grown ups. I think this dangerous, annoying and catering to the minority. Trying to move around once these ropes (barricades) are in place is like threading needles. It's painful!I'm not a fan, it's not the happiest place on earth and to say I despise their business model would be an understatement.Hope to say I'm never coming back!",-1
"we visited disneyland the back end of august 2013, we booked for 2 days to ensure we had enough time to get around both parks. we stayed at a hotel not far from the park, but a bus ride, after sandwiching us onto a bus like sardines and having to fight to squeeze onto the bus, we eventually arrived at the park. we went through bag checks, got our tickets and entered the park... the amount of visitors is overwhelming and the park is not big enough to deal with them all. grown adults pushing their way around the park, knocking over your children, the queuing is terrible, the shortest ride we queued for was 30 minutes, there were 5 of us (me, my wife and our 3 boys of 4,9 and 10yrs) this particular ride was the cars with 4 to a ride. we had 3 sat in one car with the eldest of our boys in another. after queuing, our boys were told to get out the cars and go sit with total strangers as they could not sit two to a car, despite 4 other cars with 2 persons of which 1 was an adult... when challenged, the attendant got very mouthy with me, had the park not been full of children that would have ended differently for him, luckily other visitors spoke out to him too. the rides we did get on without TOO much hassle we waited around 90 minutes on average for   others longer. the shows they put on have a queuing system, but then they lead you into a large hall before seating you, at which point it becomes a stampeed of adults all forcing their way forward as though their lives depend on it. we were in the mickey mouse clubhouse show, we were sitting at the very back (there are no seats just the floor, you are told taking pictures is ok but the couple sitting next to us were told off like school children because they used a flash! they promptly left, as we were at the back my children couldnt see so stood up   nobody behind and we were TOLD to sit down   we left that day before lunch, we had had enough. never will we visit again. my kids hated it",-1
"Fresh views from today.This was the 3rd time I've been here but 1st with the kids.  1st stop   Space Mountain   closed.  Something simple then Phantom Manor   broke down FOUR times mid ride.   Food   most places shut (on 1 July) but park crowded so huge queues. Even the kiosks that were open were not fully stocked. We weren't going to wait in a 45 min line for a tiny expensive pizza so went hungry. Got the kids some fries just before we got on the RER from a place outside the park entrance.   Fantasyland overcrowded. Fast Track for Peter Pan at 12.15pm was a 7pm entry ! Seven hours ?? really ?? We skipped it. This place used to far better.It's ageing, poorly maintained and staffed (2 characters??) and there must be better alternatives. We were at Disneyland Tokyo 18 mths ago and that was FAR more enjoyable.At least we only outlaid 39E each having bought Transilien tickets from the FNAC. Oh plus the train which is a token 7.5E for an adult for a 40 min trip. Enjoy Paris for Paris. Leave Disney for the US or Asia.",-1
I think they are aiming on a single french speaking audience because of the poor language skills and lack of friendliness of the staff. Only some Belgian and Dutch student workers could meet the standards.It's a pity to see such a park in hands of the Parisian mentality.Also this is by far the worst maintained parks of the Disney group.,-1
"It was my first time in disney land with my daughter, wife and my mom, we spend 600 $ and this is our experience:WORST, HORRIBLE DAY in our life, maybe this place was cool 60 years ago but now it looks very poor, everything so expensive, staff rude, rides always breaking down, huge queues, I cant even describe how bad and poor was this park in Los Angeles, We will not go there again even if they will pay for our plane tickets from Australia.I dreamed to go to disneyland, now I hate disneyland. WORST PARK IN THE WORLD.NOT WORTH MONEY OR TIME. Really do not recommended.",-1
"3 time to visit Disneyland, and the worse. Yes there was new attraction, Toy story and Gizzly, an there were very crowed, as the is no space in there Disneyland. This time there was dirt all over in restaurant and the cleaner just stand and look at it with out doing something. I also miss some display in the park where you can see the time to the attraction",-1
"Hong Kong is hot in the summer and very humid. Queuing up 45 minutes with two young children is not fun. And that is just to get in! Queue for tickets, queue for baggage search, queue to get in. If that how it is on the outside you can imagine what is like once inside. A 45 minute queue for a 60 second ride is not my idea of fun although some people may not mind this. Also, paying $285 for a 3 year old who cannot go on quite a few rides is just a rip off. The day is also marred by overpriced rubbish food and drinks, rude people pushing in the queues, jumping over barriers etc. whilst emplyees look on. This is not the first time I have been there but will certainly be the last for sometime. An hour there and back too just compounds the whole bad experience. Save your money and go to Ocean Park!",-1
"After visiting Disneyland annually we were so disappointed this year. It was shoulder to shoulder crowds   you could barely walk through the park much less get on a ride. The rides would say 60 minute wait but ended up taking nearly 2 hours! We WAITED IN LINE to get a fastpass for Star Tours first thing in the morning and the ticket was for 11:oo pm (yes   11:00 at night) making it impossible to use fast passes the rest of day. We waited in line to board the bus to the parking lot at the end of the day too! Disney California was just as crowded. It was a zoo and the stroller people were so RUDE   using the strollers as weapons to push through the crowds. We for the first time in 25  years of going hated our day in Disneyland   how very, very sad! We went on a Wednesday!! We are hearing it's even worse on weekends   could this be possible?? It will be a long while before we return. So much for a recession   you'd never know it in Disneyland.",-1
"I've been to euro disney in August 20, 2012. at first I was full of expectations, I thought it was the most beautiful park in Europe and one of the most beautiful parks in the world, but I was really disappointed, I knew that the park was called a  flop , but not to this extent. the price of the ticket is very expensive compared to other parks, more than 65 euro, inside the view of the castle is beautiful, however the attractions are very old and date back to the 90's, there are only 4 attractions for adults and are not even too good .. I can recommend the park for families with children, they will be crazy, but for adults is 100 times better Gardaland in Italy..only for children under 13 years ..",-1
"I would like to start by stating that I have never been to prison but I imagine it would feel the same. So you get to the park entrance by car at 8.30 and only half of the pay desks for your rip off 20euro carpark ticket are open and the queue is HUGE. At least 75 cars. The walk through gates aren't too bad if you don't take a bag but get ready to empty your pockets . .Don't faff about holding people up by trying to go through a  no bag  queue with a bag!!!! Then you rush to get your first  Fast pass  ticket, the time being 9.10am okay, the park only open for just over an hour remember. The ticket time was 11.10am. So, time to go and do a couple of rides right?? WRONG. You get to your first queue to see that its 90mins long. . .How can a queue be 90mins long when the park has only been open for 60mins??? Oh, thats right, because they only run one car for an hour so the queue builds up and you have to be there for two days not one, how silly of me!!!! And that was how the day went on, even a half hour queue for a disgusting soggy cold crepe'. Next day (knowing how long the queues would be and getting two day tickets) we got to the entrance at 8.10am to find, yep, you've guessed it, TWO gates open . . .And about 50 cars queuing. NEVER AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!PS, the rides were okay.",-1
"I have annual membership of this park for past 12 years now. We go there coz my daughter and wife love it. My best moment in this park is when we in car and start to drive back home. Here is why...1. 80% time is spend in waiting for rides or walking past the crowd.2. They have terrible terrible food quality. Although in past many years they have added many new restaurant types, but the food is just atrocious in taste. It it unhealthy and tasteless.3. Everything is overpriced.4. They are probably best in mass people movement to keep crowd in control, but it is ridiculous that it takes 60 minutes from the moment you part car to get inside the park entrance.Kids love it... but it does not mean they deserve 5stars.",-1
Decided to take my little one because I think every kid deserves to go at least once but this place is a joke and so over priced. I spent 600 dollars on tickets for me and my babe which I shouldn't have spent that much it's a damn rip off. The stupid fast pass I used once and it wouldn't let me use it anymore which was another waste of money. Plus they stop fast passes around 5pm so you have to do times like right when you get to the park. It's so crowded like you can't move without getting bumped or hit. I was there for 16 hours and rode 7 rides with my baby because most of the wait was a hour and a half to three hours which is nuts it shouldn't be that way. It isn't how it used to be that's for sure. ,-1
"May 28 my lil guy turn 4 years old so we decide to take him to the happiest place on earth. but, my son fault so out of place.he wasnt able to ride most of the ride in the park because he 39  and half tall. and u need to be 40  so i was like maybe toon town u would enjoy but, it was closed for hours do to one of disneyland worker putting a dry ice boom in the trash can. how crazy is that! So i called Disneyland to let them know we had a terrible time all the said, was  sorry  and took down my phone  ,first,last, and address. The guy didnt even care i spend over $500 on just getting into the park, snacks and drinks. NEVER AGAIN!!",-1
"Firstly, to be rejected at your entrance due to an extending go pro stick that I had in my possession was very disappointing!!! We waited in long lines to get bag searched only to be told once we had got to the front that gopro sticks were not allowed!! ABSOLUTELY NO SIGNS TO GIVE PEOPLE ADVANCED NOTICE!!! It does not make for a good day having travelled half way across the world to fulfill a childhood dream.Secondly, your lines are ridiculous!! People pay a good amount of money to come here and are barely able to get on rides due to the lines! Yes you have fast track options, but seriously, the amount of money given for entrance for approximately 6 rides people can get in within a day? Doesn't add up !! You are making money off people's childhood dreams to attend a famous park yet not really giving them an experience that they deserve for the money they pay, there seriously needs to be discussion around the amount of people that should enter on any given day, this would ensure all round fairness.Pretty disappointed in this park and the lack of attention it gives to ensuring guests times here are a pleasurable experience.",-1
"Having visited Disneyland in Orlando many times this was a disappointment. We were there with our family in May, weather was not great unlike Orlando, so prepare for  British  weather, yes rain, cold and generally unpleasant. However this is only part of the problem! Staff arrive by train from Paris, if there is a delay with their transport then attractions will not open on time. Those of you who stay in Disney accommodation who have early entry to the theme park could be disappointed as the staff are still en route to the park, not great! Go to Orando, it's wonderful, oh yes.",-1
"I have been to Disneyland Paris quite a few times. The first time was in 1992 when it first opened.Back in '92 It was expensive but well organised and the staff in general were polite and helpful. They had a happy and friendly disposition which you would expect from a theme park.I am sad to say that the original park has deteriorated and in need of a make over. The restaurants and rides are generally unresourced which makes the whole experience painful.You would for example not expect there to be long queues just to get into a restaurant. We pre booked all of our restaurants but still had to queue to get in. A 1:00 pm reservation turned out to be an actual 1:35 get into the restaurant followed by slow service. This was more a staffing issue (presumably to save money)I was also disappointed by the number of rides being refurbished. When you pay   50 00 to get in to a park, you expect to see all of it, not 85%. but at least they are refurbishing the place as it does look tired. Closed rides included space mountain, the Jules Vernes experience, etc. Some rides were closed due to technical reasons including the Aerosmith ride and thunder mountain. (I thnk some serious maintenance is required)So what else can be done to improve the experience?Add a few benches for people to sit on. There are very few places to sit, especially if you are wobbly on your legs.Fit better signage. You can spend quite a while finding things. A few extra well placed signs would go a long way.(signs in English, German, Italian, Spanish etc would not go amiss)Transport.Getting from the 'charles de gaulle' airport was a nightmare. The airport is very large and poorly signed. We laned at terminal 2 and had a train journey from the terminal to our baggage carousel. A journey of 20 30 mins. None of this was explained and we found the staff ignorant and rude.The actual bus transfer from the airport to the resort was also an experience. The driver spoke no english despte the fact that all passengers were from england. I can spek some French so I could understand the instructions (to an extent). The bus assistnat made NO ATTEMPT to help passengers with there luggage. He merely watched passengers of all ages putting there own luggage on the bus. (lazy and rude)The driver yelled 'Quelle Hotel' which i could understand but many travellers could not understand his ruse questioning.The hotel staff at the Sequoia were excellent. Friendly, well spoken and very helpful.The hotel was clean and quiet.You could walk from the hotel into Disneyland (10 15 mins) or catch a shuttle bus. Again no explanation by the driver that you needed to get off at the train station and walk 500 metres into the park.FoodAs was previously, the cost of food in the park is very expensive. I would recommend buying the food vouchers before you go, but dont buy a full board option, opt for the half board. You will get too tied down watching the clock for your next meal time.A half board option lets you choose a lunch time treat (tere are lots of places to get sandwiches, burgers etc...i.e. Earl of Sandwich, McDonalds etc)The meal vouchers are poorly explained but please note that you should book your restaurants early as the restaurants get full and you may not be able to get in. Also, some restaurants are only open lunch time ot tea time (some both)Beer is not always available...we found beer available at tea time but not lunchtime in some restaurants.Restaurants were understaffed and the service slow. The odd restaurants were however excellent i.e. Walts restaurant on Main street.We booked our restaurants on the first day (of a 5 day holiday) and the best time we could get into Cafe Disney (for a character dinner) was at 10:00pm. Not good enough when you have a 1 year old and a 5 year old.Menus also need a clarification which states which level of meal voucher you are using. We had a 'plus' meal voucher which allows you to use a certain number of selected restaurants and a particular set of meals.... this is unclear and it is easy to order food that is not on your meal plan.Snack Vouchersyou also get a set of snack vouchers which we found wee useless. You can only redeem these at certain times in certain venues. WE ended up throwing ours away. They need to be available for use all day and in all venues to be of any use.SmokingSmoking is allowed in the park...Entry TimeIf you visit by car and for the day, you will only be able to get in after 10:00am. Be prepared to queue for 30mins or more to get in.For people stopping in the complex, i.e. any hotel or the camp davey crocket, then you can get in at 8:00 but note that not all rides are open at 8:00 so it is a little bit misleading.Also, you need to access the park by the right hand queue (poorly signed) and show your disney hotel pass ID card. This gets you past the longer queues (day tripper queues)Ride Waiting TimesTimes displayed on the waiting time boards ere not particularly accurate. 10 mins could mean 20mins etc.Overall scoreI will go to Florida next time as the french resort is dated and in much need of a make over. The site is understaffed and the staff morale is generaly low. (not enough smiley faces)5 10",-1
"I really felt bad for our kids since we have spent more time in waiting than playing , the queue for each game was more than 1 hour so we got tired easily and discovered the day was over without enjoying as much as we wanted . it will not make any difference if you come early or late to Disney since you will maximum play 3 games anyway for being tired from the long waiting .we just took it as a onetime experience and for sure we will not come back . don   t stay late before the closing as the train can get full and for sure you are tired and have to wait for another queue to go back home .",-1
"We visited HK Disneyland after being sold tickets by our hotel. We arrived at the park and it was just starting to rain, whilst there are covers over the Q Line for those who need to but tickets there is nothing over the Q line...More",-1
We are disappointed that Disney is not customer oriented any longer. There were so many people in the park even for early entry that it was unbelievable. Guests with strollers are rude and if I had not moved quickly I would have been run over by a motorized vehicle. It was bad enough guests with strollers ran over my right foot and ankle while I was standing in line. The guests did not even say excuse me. Not sure if we will return since this was very disappointing with the crowds.,-1
"I'll start by saying that we live in Southern California and are annual pass holders. We have been to Disneyland and California Adventure approximately 15 times this year. This was our last time to go before our annual passes expired. We started the day by riding the California Screamin roller coaster. No complaints here. It was fun and entertaining. My seven year old loved it. After a few more rides we wound up in Disneyland searching for something to eat. That's when we stumbled into the recently renovated Village Haus restaurant. We ordered our food at the counter and sat down to eat. I inspected my hamburger and noticed the patty was cold with a wierd bluish gray color. My impression was it was a frozen patty that had been thawed under a heat lamp and slapped on a hamburger bun. The lettuce was yellowish with small brown spots on it. The fries were cold and soggy, resembling wet noodles. I had serious thoughts about taking it back, but what do you say? Excuse me, can you take this hamburger back because it's looks totally disgusting? I picked the nasty lettuce off and reluctantly ate as much of the hamburger that I could stand before I left the rest on my paper covered basket. My seven year old boy got the kids hamburger meal. It was rediculously small resembling more of a biscuit than a hamburger. It was made up of a tiny bun with a small cold gray meat patty resting inside. There were no condiments or anything even on the side. His fries were cold and soggy. He actually ate the hamburger, which surprised my wife and I, but when he was done, he complained that he was still hungry. I felt bad for my son that he was still hungry. It doesn't take much to fill up a seven year old boy and he's still hungry! Are you kidding! Now to my other son. He ordered a kids pizza meal. It was the smallest excuse for a pizza I've ever seen. Come on Disney! You've spent a couple thousand dollars this year for season passes, parking, food, and enternainment. You provide the best entertainment in the world and I have to feed my family this gross crap. We left hungry and disgusted. Since this was our last day to use our season passes before they expired, my wife and I were debating on renewing our passes. This experience made us decide to let our passes expire. I left the park feeling irritated and totally ripped off.",-1
"Bad. We went during the week and encountered a sea of strollers and Walmart scooters everywhere. Long queues, fast passes are nonsensical and give no advantage as he estimated times are very inaccurate. You're better off waiting.Staff are very un enthused  overall had a very poor experience. Couldn't get a glimpse of the night show as people   surprise, surprise   sit on the roads to secure the best spots 3 hours before (!!!) the show, as the Disney staff starts roping off sections, which ruins everything. Can't stand and look as the staff rudely ushers you around. What the hell? Double thumbs down.I recommend to go to Disney world Paris, where you actually get to enjoy your visit. ",-1
"We visited this park as part of s new year breakI have to be honest, that as a Disney fan it is disappointing for me to have to write a negative reviewIt was good to see the park receiving some well overdue upgrade works, but disappointing to see the amount of attractions out of service due to thisThe rides were also suffering with a lot of breakdowns. I wonder if this was due to cut backs in the preventative maintenance regime to save money???The staff themselves were generally Way you would expect from a Disney site however the experience was somewhat lackingWe went to the New Year's Eve fireworks display in the park. The fireworks were not 'special' but a roll over of the Christmas display. This was very disappointingAll in all, I fell that the experience was a total let down and would not be in a hurry to return",-1
"Hong Kong Disneyland is horrifying. We went there for the Chinese New Year weekend and the place was full of the most disgusting, crude, rude, and pushy guests. This is true for any attraction. There is no  line , just a wave of people shoving forward. We went all the way from the US to see this place. Don't waste your time and money.Some behavior:  Dozens of people doing their laundry on Main Street USA. These were adults washing their own things in buckets, using strollers to line dry.  Open Public Urination of grown men outside.  Sexual assault and groping of other folks in line.  Grown adults pushing toddlers over to get to the carousel.  Check out the photo. It is worth a thousand words. (Man squatting on child's stroller, while picking his nose, in red bow mouse hat.)  Pushy, Shoving, and Crowding in line  A man threw up some phlegm to his mouth, spit, and hit a food cart.  Parents telling their children to crowd in line so that they could join them.  Guests in their 20's, 30's, and 40's pushing elderly people over.The positive things are that the Maxim's restaurant was delicious. The public transportation has a Mickey Mouse train, which is very cute. They have a nice parade. However with such a poor line layout and no security staff enforcing civility, I don't see how things could improve.The best way to describe this is that my kid was horrified. She cried when we said we could go to Disneyland again. I now think of Hong Kong Disneyland as a way to traumatize children.",-1
"Can't help the weather, but what is up with closing the park for some crazy Mickey Halloween Party on M, W, F during October.Busy time of year because of all the fall breaks.Don't recommend every going at this time again.But when is it a good time to go really?",-1
"We have just returned from 4 nights at Euro Disney, we took our children out of school hoping it would be quiet, be warned the Spanish school summer holidays started a week ago and it was absolutely packed to capacity, you could barely walk and the queues were ridiculously long, over an hour for most of the big rides. The fast pass was useless unless you managed to get one first thing in the morning, by lunch time the fast passes had either run out or the next available slot was after 6pm. When you have managed to get a fast pass you cannot get another one until you have used your first one so if your fast pass ticket is for later in the day you cannot get any others. At one point the queue to get a fast pass was over 20 minutes long!!Another disappointing thing was how miserable the staff are, this is Disneyland and they could barely break into a smile. So many rides  areas were closed, I have never seen to many green boarded up areas before.It's a small world ride was absolutely stinking dirty the floor under the water outside was green with fungus and during the ride we saw empty crisp packets and drink bottles floating around.Crowd wise I don't know how this park functions during it's peak times when it was at bursting point in June with just the Spanish school children on holiday. If you are yet to book I would highly recommend you check the European school holidays as it seems with even just the one country on holiday it makes a huge difference. On a positive note, the firework show in the night (11pm!) was fantastic, Crush's Coaster ride was fantastic but the waiting times were awful. Our two daughters loved it but unfortunately couldn't get on too many rides due to the queues. Buggy hire is 15 Euros a day, if you want to keep the buggy overnight you need to pay a refundable deposit of 70 Euros. Ice cream lollys were around 3.50 Euros.",-1
First trip and last. Queues as far as the eye could see and this was mid week in February. Pushy rude people everywhere skipping in front of us in queues for rides  restaurants etc. Standing in our way for the fireworks. Its a rip off. We won't be back.,-1
"We were prepared for the lines and ques, well we thought. Way too many people for the available services. It was actually a safety issue with this many people in the Park. Restaurants were closed leaving food lines just as bad as the rides. All the fast track rides had run out of tickets by 1pm   2pm leaving nothing but ques for everything. For 100 euro I'll go find something else to do. We had planned to visit the Parks in California and Florida but that won't be happening. :(",-1
"Just got back from spending four days in Euro Disney and although I do acknowledge it was during school holidays, I was left disappointed and underwhelmed with the Disney experience especially with the amount of queuing. I have been a few times before, but a number of years ago, but boy has the place gone downhill. We spent four days queuing, often in queues that are badly managed with people pushing in (sorry, but quite often they are French) for rides that had 'technical' problems and regardless of how long you have been queuing, you are just told to come back later   after queuing for two hours for the Turtle ride, we were lucky that someone translated the announcement that the ride was being closed due to technical issues   hard to explain to an 5 and 8 year old after queuing for almost 2 hours for nothing! It probably didn't help that a number of rides were closed for refurbishment or maintenance, this just added pressure on the remaining rides. There wasn't adequate food outlets and we saw a number of kiosks closed even though there was massive queues. Be prepared to queue, queue and queue, including also having pictures taken with any characters, for a table at any of the restaurants off the park and pretty much queuing for large amounts of your day! You associate Disney as providing excellent levels of service, most of their staff need to be reminder of this (not all, but quite a few), I was even barged out of the way but one member of staff who was clearly not happy and in a rush. The park is in need of money being spent on it, some areas looked tired and water features etc were not working, there was also a fair amount of rubbish in some areas. Used to be such a magical experience and you would have thought Disney would know how to manage high volumes of people or perhaps they don't care   perhaps someone from Disney should visit as a paying customer and not as a VIP, they could be quite shocked!",-1
"I came here with my family whilst they were on vacation. I knew it was going to be busy, however, it's not good value for money. You spend most of the day queuing and waiting for one or two rides that last 5 minutes. The cost of the ticket is not worth it. They hype up the experience and mostly sell you rubbish. A lot of people expect a dreamy, exciting, fairytale. It's just not the case. DON'T GO.",-1
"I came here 20 years ago and remember it being brilliant. Admittedly I was 13 then but I really thought at least 1 thing might have changed, especially as 20 year in the film world means a lot.The whole place felt really disappointing, dipressing and old. Terrible outfits for the staff which added to the outdated rides and jobsworth idiots dressed up as Disney characters running away from guests rather than embracing them.A lot of the place was being refurbished so rides like space mountain were not an option. Long queues for rides that were pretty rubbish.There was just a general need to update the whole place, use some modern effects and being some of the Disney magic back.I wouldn't come back, even with kids, unless there was a significant update",-1
"We have been to Disneyland many, many times. This last visit was the worst. For $160 per ticket, one should be able to ride more than 4 5 rides a day. The crowds were horrendous. Thinking that it may have been close to capacity. The fast pass system is a broken system. The passes are dispersed and  sold out  at the beginning of the day, and the returns allow too many people to use fast pass. This makes the wait times even longer.Hoping that this is our last Disney trip.",-1
"We came here with our 4 year old son, so it should be said he had fun   for about 3.5 hours. That's about $23 hour. The last time we saw Disneyland was in 1984 and there has been little done to improve it   the rides are the same, the place could use bright paint and new walkways. To be honest, it was deflating to see it had not changed, except that it was overcrowded.We came on the Friday (there by 9 am). The parking and entry is well organized to get people in. Once you are there, the lines are minimum 25 minutes (even with Fastpass)   and with little kids, that gets very tiring. We happened to catch Goofy early on and waited 5 minutes, but all other characters were minimum 30 minutes by 10:30 am. Not our cup of tea!It is nice that they let you take strollers, food and drink   otherwise this would have been an even more expensive venture. (Take your valuables with you when you get on a ride, and leave your stroller...)For us, Disneyland was enough for a one time visit, but never again.",-1
"I had the unfortunate experience of taking my young daughters to Disneyland Paris over the Christmas period.NEVER EVER AGAIN!Firstly, we were greeted by a huge protest after entering the ticket turnstiles. All the cleaners were complaining over pay. Now I'm all for a peaceful protest but smashing the front of the park up with metal poles and rods, whilst adorning the welcome to Disney sign with every possible item of rubbish is hardly my idea of  welcome to the magic  that is Disney. If you really think that you should continue with this moniker then I'd suggest you better handle these incidents. This left my youngest distraught and my oldest wanting to never return again, preferring to go to bloody Thorpe park!.Secondly, the park just looks dated and unclean. A good example being in Discovery land where it was absolutely filthy. It looked as though the park has been desolate and neglected. The Star Tours jet was covered in muck. You wouldn't see such a poor showing in Disney world Florida.Thirdly, Customer Service. OH MY WORD. There was a huge queue at the customer services department due to many visitors undoubtedly being just as p!$$ed off as I was. To make matters worse I witnessed a gentleman frustrating his anger just to be laughed at by the supervisor in customer services. If it were me I'd have throttled the bloke. I've always associated Disney with great customer service where they can't do enough for you (of course within reason) and where they are polite at all costs and service is with a smile. The poorer Paris counterparts are in dire need of some training. Ridiculous is all I can say. Fourthly, Character showings were poorly organized though most of the characters were incredibly pleasant. Finally, I found the restaurants to be incredibly pricy and the food lacking any real quality. I don't think I've ever experienced food so poor in what is meant to be one of the country's of choice for cuisine. I know this is a theme park so the standards shouldn't be too high, but nevertheless it was just not up to scratch. Went for a meal at planet Hollywood in downtown Disney and the service was great and food quality much improved.There were plus points like the service at cafe mickey but my advise is to go to Florida. save some extra cash and experience what Disney should actually stand for. Even when complaining the customer service team could only offer a days complimentary passes. Quite frankly I'd pay not to go there again!!! Florida yes, California yes, Paris HELL NO!!!Appalled!!!",-1
"We were horrified by the 'technical problems' at multiple rides in both parks which resulted in even longer delays at crowded rides. Added to this was people smoking all over the parks, including in crowded lines and restaurants and in front of cast members who ignore it, which makes the no smoking policy laughable.We have been to Disneyland parks in the US, Tokyo and Hong Kong, and feel that Paris could learn a lot from any of them. We have been to Paris Disney twice before, admittedly several years ago, and it has noticeably changed for the worse.Have always loved Disneyland Parks, but after this experience we are disillusioned and have no desire to return. A waste of our money.",-1
"We went there last year with our son aged 11, and he enjoyed it without reservation. However I have been to Disney Anaheim, at my wife has been to Anaheim, Florida and France, and we found it a little bit small and tame. If you have kids that are a little older or keen on really wild rides, they're going to be disappointed here. On the other hand smaller children will probably really enjoy it. Apart from the size, standard Disney experience. Ocean Park may be a better bet.",-1
"Getting there was easy as pie, being from another country. Caught the train to Disneyland station and the Park was just a few steps away.I was excited at first, but that soon changed as time went on. It didn't feel like there was magic and it was a lot smaller to what I was expecting.We lined up for a ride, as it said that it was only going to be a 20min wait. We ended up in line for almost an hour and then even before we could get on, the ride had to be closed. We gave up on trying to go on rides after that as the lines were way too long.The only good thing was that we decided to eat lunch early. So we managed to beat the lunch rush.In the end we just took a lot of photos. There were just too many people. You will need more than 1 day if you want to go on all the rides.At least I can say that I had stepped foot in Paris Disneyland.",-1
"Bought entry and parking online before we went. Thought & read it is easier & cheaper  WRONG! Could it find the parking, many others had to take a U turn to find it too. Not labeled well at all! Finally found something and parked. Disneyland was great, 1st time for the kids, came out to pay for parking & we were in the wrong lot for the pass we had, had to pay again! Ugh! They need much better signage for just getting there once on Disney property!",-1
"After spending so much time in the Disney flagship park in Anaheim, we were very surprised to see Disney Paris looking so rundown and somewhat shabby on the edges. In Anaheim, there are cast members constantly maintaining the bathrooms, the streets and every little nitch of the park. If there is chipped paint on the teacups, there is someone there at midnight to repaint. Not so in Disney Paris. Again, the bathroom smell could make you throw up, and it didn't look like maintenance had been there in a week! The painted railings for the queues were all worn off exposing the bare metal. The one bright spot was our lunch at Walt's restaurant. The food and ambience were quite good, although we had better value at a small bistro in Paris. It is just sad to me that the Disney company would take such pristine care with Anaheim and not do the same for Paris. Considering how the company prides itself on the  guest experience,  they really should apply the same level of care to each and every park that bears their name.",-1
"We go to Disneyland (Anaheim) every year and were so excited about seeing Disneyland in France. WHAT A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!I just read that Paris Disneyland wants billions of Euros to fix the park. It needs it. The grounds around It   s a Small World need maintenance   there were weeds! The rest of the park didn't improve much more. The sound tracks on the rides were set really quiet and were difficult to hear. It almost made you feel that it wasn   t about the Disney experience; it was just about the rides. (Then, remove the Disney name and let France run the park!) It was    not the happiest place on earth.    It   s hard to believe it   s even Disneyland! There was no music or entertainment; no excitement to be there! There were no MM Ears; really! Paris is too good to have MM Ears. There is very little to buy in the shops; mostly, princess costumes and accessories.Walt Disney Studios is a total waste...there's about two rides worth riding.",-1
"We were very excited to be taking our young child to Disneyland Park, Paris. We had been to many theme parks and were expecting at least the same value, quality and experience. Given the price of entry to the Park, we thought that this alone reflected the quality. Unfortunately, we got none of those. First impressions are that the line to get in moved too slow. It took us almost an hour just to get in the park???!! Our first stop   bathroom. Oh Boy ... the smell was atrocious. I doubt that the plumbing was adequate to keep up with the number of tourists that visit the park. It was so disgusting that I reported it to staff   thinking that a sewerage pipe had broken. Even the staff member told me that nothing was broken, just a lot of people visit the bathroom???? Most of the rides in the park required at least a 95 minute wait and as you can imagine, young children can't wait in line that long. We went in the middle of the week; no school holidays and apparently on a  better day  than normal. Long story short, we couldn't wait to get back to Paris city away from the dreadful smells and queues. On a positive note, the grounds themselves, were very well kept & nice and green and full of flowers. In the middle of Paris City, near La Place de la Concorde, there is a little amusement park open and our child and many children we knew had more joy at this little amusement park  free entry, just pay for rides  than they did at Disneyland. Should have stayed in Paris city. But you have to try it to know.",-1
"You will be bitterly disappointed if you have had the luxury of going to Walt Disney World Florida. Disneyland Paris lacks the sparkle, magic, good rides and excellent customer services that the Americans are so good at. In the parade the eyes of Simba (Lion King) were broken   its just something you cant imagine happening at the Florida parks. The customer services was non existent, in the USA the staff fall over themselves to help you, in Paris you cant find any staff to help you. Very disappointing, we wont be returning.",-1
I recently spent 4 days at both Disney Parks with 3 children and we also stayed in a Disney Hotel (Davy Crockett Ranch) so I feel justified in writing a review. The experience was quite simply atrocious. I mean absolutely abysmal. I build product teams for a living and if I had been involved in putting out such a sub par product I would be ashamed. Here is a brief list of the problems   1. Rides that were closed Aerosmith roller coaster closed Animagique closed Star Wars ride closed Thunder Mountain closed Big Mesa Waterboat closed Peter Pan Ride closed Pirate Island playground closed Pocahontas playground Future land train station closed Swiss Family Robinson closed Andy RC racer closed Pizza Planet closed Agrabah cafe closed Horse Drawn a arrives closed Main Street train closedFuete Restaurant Closed2. Rides that broke down Disney Juniors broke down 30 seconds before the start...literally 30 seconds with no apology and nearly 100 crying kids who had waited for upwards of an hour Ratatouille ride broke down after 40 minute wait Slinky roller coaster closed early at 4pm Magic carpets fast pass machine out of order Monsters Inc scream o meter out of order Magic Carpet ride   three of the carpets malfunctioned and refused to rise; parents had to complain 80 minute wait for Nemo roller coaster and no fast pass available 3. Issues with meals   eating Restaurant booking system broke down across the park on Tues 5th meaning could not make reservations to use meal tickets Restaurant reservations were only taken in person in the restaurant....genius idea except Davy Crockett ranch is 5 miles from the park... The team time snack for Disney Studios is redeemable in only one restaurant which had counters closed during the peak period of 3 6 with an average 20 minute wait Under 3's eat free...except at Davy Crockett Ranch where under 3's are given Apple pur  e for the duration of the holiday. Saw a customer being refused to trade his baguette for a packet of cornflakes No cornflakes available on third day 4. General criticisms There are more merchandise shops open than rides   that is unacceptable Every restaurant is used a way to sell merchandise which generates awful queues The kids area of Disney Studios (Playland) is 1 3 of the size of the adults area with tight lanes and steps whilst the adults area (Armageddon) is wide boulevards. Who thought that up?! No characters to greet people on entry or exit to the park over any of the four days. Seriously? I mean not one character to greet guests? Walked around both parks for 4 days and we saw two characters   Pluto and Marie from Aristocats. That is simply unacceptable. Summary Without doubt one of the worst experiences of a theme park I have ever had. Basically; 3 children spent four days looking for mockery mouse and the only place they saw him was on the merchandise you ram down customers throats after the rides break down. You should be ashamed.,-1
Was there with my two kids and we left after 4 hours. It was simply so overcrowded and impossible to get around. Waiting times for attractions was between 60 and 90 minutes. Shame on Disney for selling so many tickets that their guests get an experience like this. This was supposed to be the best experience of our 4 weeks vacation in the US and ended being the worst.,-1
Why did we go? We spent a small fortune and we did it on a relatively small budget. Standing for over an hour for a 60 second ride. In a small town fair you could have the same thing for   2 it would last longer and no wait!!! Dreadful food dreadful crowds. Standing in sea of stupidity. I feel ashamed that we bought into this. We do this because of the advertising and peer pressure hype. The emperor's new clothes brought bang up to date !!,-1
"Well this will be our 3 trip to California Disney park and our last , It so not worth the money , to many grown adults with NO CHILDREN wait for kids rides ! Why does grown adults of 30 plus years want to got on the tea cups or dumbo rides ... ? Or worst still que to meet Micky mouse! They make the que lengths even longer, it hard enough keeping toddles in check without having to wait for 40 mins or more for rides and to meet characters . I feel that a lot of the rides are out dated and modernisation of a lot of them is well over due ,Disney is def look old and tired, come on Disney An overhaul is well over due ",-1
"It's a little difficult to describe the experience there... A lot of good things in the park, but a lot of bad things either... the staff is great and helpful... The food court is to avoid... The toilets needs to be cleaned more often, the attractions are typically Disney... Unbelievably expensive merchandise... Great fireworks at night... ",-1
"The French think they own the place, the main goal of Disneyland Paris is to part you with your money, The whole place is just a total rip off and sub standard compared to the Florida park.",-1
"We arrived at Disney full of excitement and anticipation, however this quickly goes and then the true horror reveals it self! (Halloween on us being the joke) Queues queues queues queues queues, packed solid couldn   t even walk down Main Street without being quashed and shoved. 2hrs wait for rides, meeting characters and the horror goes on... we had to wait in line for 1.5 hour for any type of food, I felt so sorry for staff they got the direct complaints from customers. The hotel Santa Fe was badly disorganised but there was one glimmer of hope was the food in hotel was good lots of choice! I would not recommend Disney to anyone!!!",-1
"Went to Disneyland with the kids at Easter time and it was so crowded you couldn't see 2 feet in front of you. The wait to get any food in the park was as long as half an hour at the little snack stands and several hours at any of the sit down restaurants. The lines at the attractions were generally 75 minutes or so, and even when we got fast passes first thing in the morning, we couldn't do the ride til 9:30 at night. Some of the rides, like space mountain, were completely out of fast passes. We waited in line for HOURS and then when we finally got on the ride, it was...nothing. A roller coaster in complete darkness. Long lines at the Matterhorn for a sad little roller coaster with really hard seats that trundled past a shopworn  abominable snowman  and some plastic  ice crystals . Totally out of date and crummy. At California Adventure, we thought we'd get to ride the big roller coaster, but it was shut down for the day, no refunds. Same with the big ferris wheel. Not much else to do there for kids older than 9 except for the Tower of Terror (truly terrifying, a good ride if you like that kind of thing) and the Drop Zone ride, same thing as Tower of Terror only outdoors. On teh other hadn, Universal Studios was not crowded, fun, hip, and completely entertaining, with great shows, amazing stunts and fun rides.",-1
"Visited on August 22. Park attractions are mostly for young children and kind of boring for teens. The lines were short for roller coaster but long for plain carousels suitable for smaller kids. But who have the patience to stay in line for 40 60 min holding the toddler? No characters walking through the park! The dream of my oldest child was to have a photo with Mickey mouse, but we couldn't find any. We say Peter Pan running through the park, like he was chased by someone... Captain Hook maybe. Big Thunder Mountain just closed at 6 for reason unknown. Those who waited for 40 min were really disappointed... The park is opened til 11pm, but restaurants are working till 4:30 5pm. Seriously? We didn't want to wait for 2 hours in line for food, so we came to eat around 4pm. After us the restaurant closed!The 'magic' show with fireworks is at closing time: 11pm. Around 6 it started raining, there are not so much places to hide from rain, so we just left. Still, even if it was sunny, after long day, who ( and i mean kids) have energies to stay till 11pm for the show? Why not at 9 at the sunset, or 10 pm?Bottom line: after being in Legoland, Gardaland, Europa Park, Efteling over last 4 years, DisneyLand Park is the most expensive and the most outdated, overcrowded, non attractive place to visit",-1
"Having visited the Disney parks in both FL and CA in the states I have certain expectations of the Disney brand and parks and this park fell extremely short. From the initial unorganized entrance to the park to the lack of cast members available, it was a let down. Lots of areas in the park were under renovation while we were there, and there was nothing to make up for it. We were there the Monday before Easter and the crowds were terrible. And let   s add to the fact that visitors to this park will cut you in line and skip through the lines and not blink an eye, super annoying. They do this for all lines. We waited in line for Big Thunder mountain for 40 min only to be abruptly told to get out of line. Apparently the ride broke and that was it. No further explanation, no sorry, nothing. The very few cast members we encountered were unfriendly, unhelpful, and did not have any    Disney    magic. We love Disney and have been visiting the parks annually for the past 11 years. We would never go back to this park. ",-1
"My husband and I recently returned from a long weekend in Paris. Since we were ahead of schedule, we thought we would catch some Euro Disney Magic! What we caught was very long lines, Fast Pass booths closed, several attractions closed, too many restaurants cafes and too few attractions. The staff was terrible at loading attraction cars   normally, you line up and they try to fill all the seats, right? 20% of the cars that went by were empty. Also, in six hours, we did not see ONE charachter! It was unbelievable considering that it was so busy. At best, it was lousy. If you are an American, you will most likely hate it. Another poster said the entrance was beautiful, but it went downhill FAST after that. I agree. Also, be careful if you take the RER out to Disney from Paris. Be sure your fare is correct before you arrive as you insert your RER ticket for entry into the Park. If your fare is short, you are locked out and you have to buy a  violators ticket  for 25 Euro. Europa Park in Germany is 10 X better.",-1
"If you are a Disney superfan then my opinion doesn't matter. If you are a Disney hater then you already have made your decision. This is my narrow view of my first and only visit to Disneyland based on a 2 day visit after New Years 2014.You know that everything is expensive. You know that it is crowded. You really have no idea how bad it really is until you are in the middle of that mess. It would take coercion and the ability to carry a cattle prod for me to even consider it again.Ticket prices for a day or two work out to about $100 a day. If you want to go for a longer time, it makes the daily costs considerably less per day.It is always crowded (so I am told) but this was nuts. I have nothing to compare it to except maybe the crowd views in New York during New Years Eve. Simply waking place to place was time consuming. Waiting between 45 minutes to 200 minutes for a ride?!? Really??? Many of the rides broke down during the day. You would think they could maintain these things a little better. Considering the cost of everything they should be able to plate it in gold. The grounds were not as well maintained as other Disney parks around the world.There are a few good things about Disneyland. If you like the characters, they are always out to sign autographs and take pictures. They know how to make some pretty interesting rides: 3D, 4D with smells and other effects. They go all out for the holidays and even change some of their rides based on the holiday season. Haunted mansion was fitted with Jack Skellington things for Christmas and Its a Small World was also Christmas themed.The bottom line is that my visit sucked, but their rides and attractions are interesting hence the raiting of 2. I like Disneyworld, but Disneyland was not for me. Your experiences may be different.Good luck and Happy Travels!",-1
"Went during the off peak season and quite a few restaurants stalls rides were closed   too many for my liking and some restaurants even closed early (surely worthy of some sort of discount to get in?!). The food and drink is expensive although you can get cheaper snacks and drinks from the Relay shop (the larger one of the two) in the train station. The fast food is atrocious and unimaginative compared with the likes of Hong Kong Disneyland, Tokyo Disneyland and Tokyo DisneySea. Only one flavour of popcorn was available   no caramel, chocolate, curry, honey, milk tea, salt and pepper, soy sauce, strawberry, white chocolate, etc. The stalls only sold candy apples and doughnuts   no churros, cookies, frozen yoghurt, hot dogs, pizza cones, waffles, etc.We did get to see a lot of characters however and as the Halloween season was beginning, the villains were out in force, even doing their own show followed by a meet and greet. Rafiki and Timon on 1 10 15 were great, full of energy and mischief, as they perked up our spirits after a long day.There were a lot of smokers in the park. What is wrong with people? Why is smoking not banned here? The majority of the Disney staff were friendly and went out of their way to help you except for one   Stephane. Rude, grumpy, unhelpful with a bad attitude. Not what you'd expect from a Disney employee and ruined your mood.Buzz Lightyear Laser Blast is always fun but it constantly broke down while we were on it and some of the targets didn't work (tested thoroughly during the many disruptions).Bring a coat, the area is flat and gets very breezy when you're outside.",-1
"Came to have a Disney weekend. Stayed at a hotel nearby and enjoy their free shutte.As usual, minimum queue is 60mins 90mins for each attraction that last at 2mins max.Disney have to find a solution to shorten this time lost everytime you visit the park so that people who bought ticket  2park 1day  can actually visit properly these park within their day limit",-1
"Not a good time to go. Online ticket machine scanner not working, so we waited over an hour at the guest relations window to get our online ticket scanned just to gain entry into the park. Extremely inefficient if you ask me, considering there were only several people in the line before us, and three windows servicing guests. Half the rides were closed for refurbishment or were not operating due to wet weather. All the large 'thrilling' rides were basically not operating. Some of these closures were not mentioned on the website either, so we came expecting to at least be able to enjoy some rides. We were left with the more family friendly rides which can be kind of a bore one after the other. We left the park at 5pm, the earliest I have ever left Disneyland. There really wasn't much to do or see there. Extremely disappointing and not worth the money you pay to get in right now.",-1
"Combination of humidity, heat and serpentine queues of mainland tourists spoils the Disney experience. We had to wait over an hour in many of the lines. Also some of the shows are in Cantonese and the place a lot smaller, making it a far lesser experience than the US one.",-1
I haven't been to a theme park as bad as Hong Kong Disneyland. As usual long queues. Rides were poor and rough with probably only 2 rides in the whole park suitable for pre teens and myself who loves a good roller coaster ride. More suited for very young children.,-1
"Slightly disappointed during our visit to Disney, felt very over priced, and treated 2nd class for being a foreigner. Had fast passes, was told they didn't work, then the next attraction accepted it, I mentioned they should tell the co workers at the Buzz Light year ride...I was approached by the manager for more detail, which was interesting...but a true apology would mean more...my intent was not to get anyone in trouble, just...well it felt discriminatory. The line up for photo with Mickey and Minnie at 2:34 minutes, well nice but not that nice.. Photo Pass cards with no photos to add to the collection, only 3 of 6 cards worked..so for a favorite stop in my passed, it's not shining like it used too...maybe Florida next time",-1
"I went there two days ago with my daughter (16 y.o) and grandson (6 y.o), they both hated it! There were absolutely no parades or shows, and trust me, I triple checked with staff to see if any were on that day. There were very few rides, the ones that were open weren't available for the younger ones. There were many, many shops which were massively over priced, they defiantly upped the prices (  100 for a cowboy outfit!). The staff, costumed and un costumed were both rude and inactive with my grandson. The only character around was Mickey Mouse and you had to pay to take a picture with him! The food was overpriced and there was only fast food; on top of that I paid to stay at the 5* hotel on the park but they mixed up our reservation so I ended up paying for a more expensive room after waiting an hour. Seriously. Worst holiday ever!",-1
"I would recommend not going to the park at the moment if you have older children due to so many rides closed. I presume it's all being refurbished for summer. When we were there they might as well shut down Frontier Land altogether as everything was closed apart from restaurants and merchandise shops. I feel we should be informed of this before we buy the tickets or provide a discount. Also, we queued for three other rides which closed due to technical issues. Three hours of waiting wasted. There were good points; all staff were friendly and helpful, the rides we did get on were good but overall disappointed and not worth the price at the moment.",-1
"Just spent oneday at both parks. In Disney losts of the attractions were closed, yet got hammered for full price. I went 20 years ago when it opened and wanted to take my son Stood in line for over an hour to buy tickets and watch only one wicket be opened until 10:45. Apparently the French do not share the customer experience that happened in the US parks. I wouldst suggest that you save your money and fly to Orlando. Closed   space mountain, star tours, captain Nemo's sub, phantom manor , thunder Mesa riverboats landing. Way too much to be closed for full price. Heck even the bathrooms were closed and the other one didn't have a dryer that worked in the men's bathroom. I wish I read these reviews before I wasted my time and money!!!! Don't go!!!!!!!",-1
Small and dated. Poor facilities. Young children will enjoy the place. The food is very expensive...,-1
I love visiting here with my girlfriend but it was ridiculously packed this time about 3 4 hours wait times for each ride. For the price of the ticket it was not that worth it,-1
"We went for one day and I have to say, it was awful. We've been to the parks in Florida multiple times and absolutely love them. Disneyland was a stark contrast. Absurdly crowded, awful wait times, insensitive staff, and completely overpriced. You shouldn't have to pay over $100 per ticket to only get to ride 2 or 3 rides. With an average wait time of over 90 minutes the kids were ready to kill one another. We will never be back.",-1
"I went to Disneyland Paris in April 2015 and was completely unimpressed with the number of rides that were closed not working on the day. On Disney's website they do keep a list of rides that are currently closed for maintenance however on the day many of the main attractions such as Space Mountain, Rock and Rollercoaster were closed yet I was charged the full price.Secondly the lack of vegetarian food available in the park's restaurants park was disappointing.I would recommend if you have young children to go however if you are looking for a few faster rides I would give this a miss. If you are a veggie take your own food",-1
"I love Disney but was really ,really disappointed this visit when my two favourite rides were both out of action at the same time !!! When you are travelling with teenagers it meant that they were too bored with the other parts of the part too quickly and it soon list its magic on a four day stay ! Have to say this was really poor   several other main attractions out of action too   surely these maintenance operations could be timed better ! Was really excited about this holiday and have to say it fell flat   disappointing beyond belief !",-1
"Having taken our own Children to Disney World Florida , Disneyland Paris is a very poor second in both location, Staff & actual co ordination of many of the events. Took our 7 year old Granddaughter to have her be upset on several occasions as the Character Guides had the well known Gallic attitude of just standing around as pushy parents blatantly pushed their Child to the front of the queue for character autographs. Did not seem at all interest at the call of many parents to stop letting French children in first and just shrugged their Shoulders and in most cases just turned there backs towards you. Paid extra to stay at the Newport Hotel with the promise of early access to find on one of the days we went down to get in early to Magic Kingdom was told by the Gate Guide that they where not letting in people early that day without any other reason, asked to see a manager and just got the usual gallic Shoulder Shrug which also was the response to all the other annoyed early bird ticket holders. My advice is save up and get a real Disney Experience at Disney World Florida.. As for the food quality the best food on offer was off site at McDonalds if you didn't mind a very long queue which will show how poor the food quality was. On several occasions had to return stone cold food back to the provider where you noticed they just put the food back on the food tray to pass on to another customer who would not probably complain. The last point is I live in Yorkshire and the Weather is really poor in this area of France with a cold wind blowing in most areas of Disneyland Paris. We will not return to Disneyland Paris a very poor place and Disney should really send in management from America to sort out what is a expensive poorly run Disney Park",-1
"We used to love going when our kids were young however after waiting to pay for the $20 parking then we get to security and they have our four university kids go through the metal scanner and not us. Just so happens our daughters friend originally from India. I don't think that is a coincidence at all since they never asked us and we were behind them.Add to that it was my husband that forgot his large pocket knife in his pocket and our kids had nothing on them. So much for good security but that is what you get with discriminating against youth  and other races.It's one thing to wait for lines but quite another for several of the washrooms to closed or as one staff told us  the line up for the women's restroom is a nightmare .Add to that two of the best rides were closed. For some reason Disneyland does not bother to post that at the gate. I really think they should give a reduced rate when some of the major rides are closed.Then the food is and has been absolutely gross. I don't know how a kid friendly socially responsible business can serve such deep fried crap. I realize some parents allow kids that stuff but at least offer some healthy options.So with the open discrimination, the closed rides, the awful food and the terrible line ups it will be a very very long time before we come back if ever.",-1
"We stayed at the Newport hotel and visited for 4 days. The hotel was fine, very basic but did the job for what you need it for. The character meet and greets were a good touch even if they queues were quite long.The disappointment was the park   it   s not fair comparing it to USA Disney but it falls so far short it   s incredible. We came for meet and greet with Captain America which relies on an App to book....it is impossible to book anything on the app. So basically, the feature attraction is unattainable. Complaints about this are dismissed by customer service staff out of hand. In general staff are not Disney standard   very little is done to answer questions or deal with issues and there is certainly no evidence of going above and beyondThe choice of attraction is ok, though availability of Fast Pass is poor. It is employed on some attraction when not needed and is missing on others where it would be useful.Falls well below what I perceive the Disney experience to be",-1
I was here for two day's this march and this was the first time I have been disappointed. I know that there were Attractions that were going to be closed but once inside the park there were other Attractions closed that were not listed as closed on the website and on the board at the gate. ,-1
"Read this review if your kids like roller coasters. I read several reviews before going, and knew some rides were closed, but was not clear of the extent. The main park has FOUR roller coasters. 2 of which require a 132cm height, and 2 others which seem to require 120cm or below. Both of the rides which can be ridden by smaller children are closed, AT THE SAME TIME. The mind boggles. I found it particularly galling that Space Mountain, which my child has ridden many times at HK Disneyland (a great park though very busy) requires 132cm in Paris but only 120cm in HK. (I thought this was a safe bet and I didn't check   doh!) On top of that, another ride he loves, RC Racer is partitioned in another park you'd have to pay more money for. We stayed a couple of hours and left... our worse day in Paris and our worse day at a Disney Park.",-1
"We were so excited to visit the original Disneyland, but couldn't have been more disappointed. The overcrowding was unbelievable for an 'off peak' Thursday  i can't even begin to imagine a peak day... We managed to get on 3 rides the whole day, the queuing was out of control  going round the sides of rides before you'd even get in the actual 'ride queue'  so people would be pushing in and confused as to what they were even in line for. Kids seemed bored with waiting around, so many smaller children running about seemingly by themselves and in huge crowds this was shocking and worrying, and the amount of oversized strollers wasn't good  running over toes, banging into people, it was like herding cattle getting out of the park at closing time. Nobody seemed in a good mood after their visit  just stressed. That isn't magic...The rides we wen't on were 'ok', but we expected character greetings. After visiting universal studios only days before, the contrast was so extreme. There, everyone was so so friendly and would take time out for pictures, but the characters here would run away from all of that. They seemed on a hugely tight schedule, I saw so many kids unable to have pictures. We managed to get one picture with Goofy, but the 'rushing' staff member accompanying had her finger over the lens so that was a waste... Could use their time more wisely if it is so short?! If you are choosing between Universal or Disney to visit  I cannot recommend Universal enough, but Disney just killed the magic. It seems to be about the money rather than truly caring about the guests having the best experience. Huge disappointment.",-1
"I can   t even believe I just gave a Disney park 2 stars. We absolutely LOVE Disney and are longtime visitors to WDW, however this was our 1st visit to Disneyland. Maybe it was the fact that we went over the 4th of July, but we found the park unbearable after about 1pm. Thank goodness for Maxpass. We knew going in that it was a lot smaller than Magic Kingdom, but holy cow the crowds. The lines for food were crazy. I waited 45 minutes AFTER I ordered at Bengal BBQ. I had already been in line for about 15 minutes just to order, which wasn   t too bad. But to wait 45 min to get the food was unbelievable and then one of our kabobs was raw. In hindsight we should have used mobile ordering. I think the thing that really did it for us were the numerous large families that were blatantly cutting the line. I   m talking 8 12 ppl (no joke) pushing themselves thru or actually unhooking the chains. This happened quite frequently, it was unreal. It made me think this was the norm here. Through out the park, the cast members were a strange mix of extremely friendly and helpful to some that were downright rude, which surprised me. The wifi was spotty and my phone battery drained very quickly using the app. Make sure you have a few portable chargers on you. I   m a huge Disney fan, but I don   t really have much of a desire to return other than to maybe see what we missed. I was pretty disappointed since this was a longtime bucket list kind of thing. We felt like we missed so much of the basic atmosphere because there were just so many people absolutely everywhere. We only had one day in each park, so that was part of the problem. Trying to cram it all in. If I could do it again, I would have gone with 3 day park hoppers. DL in the am and hop over to DCA mid day. DCA was awesome btw, which was another surprise :)",-1
"The park was crowded even in an yellow orange rated day. A lot of rides were either broken or in maintenance, and even the best ones, like the Aerosmith Rock'n Roller Coaster, Phantom Manor, Pirates of the Caribbean and Star Wars hyperspace Mountain.We spent our fast pass in the Big Thunder Mountain, which got closed while we were in the fast pass queue to enter it, due techinical problems! And it was not solved that day! And due the time restrictions, we were unable to reschedule it.The Fireworks show was too late, when we reached the metro station in Paris, the metro was already shutdown, take care when planning it.If you already visited the Florida parks, don't waste your time. Even the queues in the Florida parks are funnier than the Paris' parks.",-1
Disneyland is my favorite vacation but it's way to busy in October. A friend I was with during this trip said it was busier than their summer visit! Lots of rides closed down for temporary repair when had waited in line for 1  hrs. Very frustrating!,-1
"If you have been to Paris and Orlando, I wouldnt recommend having high expectations. I was really disappointed, the castle was absolutely tiny. Not too many rides either.",-1
"I was disappointed during my recent visit to Disneyland. This is all Disney's fault. After all, they are the ones who set my expectations so high in the first place. Disneyworld is amazing. Disneyland has decent rides, and absolutely terrible customer service.First, the parks. If you have been to Disneyworld, then Disneyland will feel like a letdown in comparison. It is in the middle of a city, so you don't get the same experience of being transported to another world as you do with Disneyworld. Everything is smaller, especially the castle. It also feels much more crowded than Disneyworld. California Adventure is neat and has some things you cannot find at Disneyworld.The staff at Disneyland is not nearly as courteous or polite as the staff at Disneyworld. There were two particularly glaring examples of this. I was travelling with my disabled daughter and there were several rides at Disneyland where no attempt was made to provide a reasonable accomodation per ADA guidelines. In all cases, there was nothing about the ride itself or the line structure, etc. that prevented Disney from making an accomodation in our case. They simply chose not to do so. This is not the case at Disneyworld. Disneyland also does not advertise the fact that they fail to comply with ADA requirements, so guests with disabilities who are used to having reasonable accomodations at other parks get no warning that a good percentage of the rides will be unavailable to them until after they have paid their non refundable money for tickets.The ride operators were not polite about the failure to provide accomodations. One man literally screamed at a woman in line in front of me and told her that she should go somewhere else if she didn't like how they had set things up. She and her daughter walked away in tears as a result. Other operators were repeatedly confused and provided conflicting information on where to go when using a guest assistance pass, etc.We stayed to watch the fireworks one night. There were repeated warnings that the park lights would be turned off and we should not move during the fireworks show, so my family and I picked out a spot along the railing to the side of a walkway. Five minutes after the show started, a Disney employee started shining her flashlight in my face and loudly told us that we needed to go somewhere else because we were blocking the walkway. Keep in mind that the walkway was about 20 30 feet wide at this point, and we were taking up at most 2 feet of this as we stood touching the side railing. I politely told the employee that I did not feel safe trying to move with my 3 small children in the darkness. She responded by threatening to call security and have me kicked out of the park! During this exchange, my oldest daughter got confused and started to follow the Disney employees instructions by walking off into the dark night into a crowd of people. It took us 5 10 minutes to find her and the Disney employee refused to let me use her flashlight or provide any other help in locating the child that she had caused to get lost.These experiences unfortunately marred what should have been a very enjoyable experience at Disneyland.",-1
"I am a huge fan of Disney and the Disneyland theme parks, and regularly visit the parks in Florida. However, the rides here are very run down (eg. Speakers in the rock n rollercoaster not working). My main complaint is the customer service   the staff were not helpful and and often very rude. For example, it was about 7.05pm and a staff member had directed me to the nearest toilet, however we were refused entry because we did not have the  extra magic hours  wristband. I could understand being refused entry to a ride, but to the toilet?! That is a absolutely ridiculous. A toilet is an amenity. We spent another 20 minutes getting to the next toilet as the park was so crowded. Will not be returning to Disneyland Paris.",-1
"So we were celebrating my sons 5th birthday it was his first trip to Disney and I have to say it was very disappointing. I am a 90's kid that grew up going to Disney world so it was my first trip to Disney land. There were no character we spend the day at the park and only got 2 autographs and that was after waiting over an hour to meet Mickey. We never seen Minnie Mouse, Donald, daisy or even Pluto. We did see goofy and got an autograph but when we seen chip and dale as we got to lineup we were told that they were leaving. This continues to happen all day. Wel left the park with only 2 sad signatures. I think the characters need to be more available to the travelers if they need to walk away and switch the person inside the suit to make people happy then they should or I am sure there is more than one goofy suit that one can go in back and another comes back out with in 5 min a kid would think oh he just went to change clothes because he was hot or dirty . All the time we were told no for an autograph really made me say I will not return to this park and would rather save for the longer trip to Florida for a GREAT experience. Our family had meme we travel from Chicago and Arizona for this trip and it was not a great experience. :(",-1
"Despite being a seasoned traveller I just couldn't cope with the cultural differences. To most Brits and Americans the French will come across as incredibly rude! We lost count of the number of times we were shoved out of the way, coughed on, had food thrown over us...the list goes on. After my 4 year old had been physically kicked off her seat during the stunt show, we could stand no more and came home. Every country has it's fair share of morons, but France's share all seemed to be on a trip to Disneyland this weekend.",-1
"I'm a Californian and I won't recommend coming to Disneyland to any tourist , save your money since there is a parking fee of 18 US Dlls and also each ticket is 105 US dlls per person . I'm a traveler and I finally decided to come here but you pay a log for only two rides , yes that's ride by the time you go to park your car and the entrance of the theme park you have waisted 2 hrs and 5 lines . This is the most expensive park and I won't recommend , there are other sites in California for your kids to visit . You will spend about 1500 dlls with accommodations and tickets just for only one day . There is Santa Monica and other theme parks with less headaches and more organize in California. Disneyland is just overrated for the kind of money you spend in here . Please keep your money and take your kids to see a Disneyland show instead they would enjoy it more . ",-1
"I have visited disneyland paris several times as a child and as a adult alike but my current trip starting the 20th May in the Disneyland park with my partner and 5 year old daughter has been very disappointing, we have found alot of the main attracions to be closed for refurbishment and as my daughter is only 126cm she cannot go on the idiana jones or space mountain rides, she may be 5 but she is a great thrill seeker and with the big thunder mountain being the only big coaster she could ride being closed she was very bored and unimpressed by rides like pinocchio and snow white. Then also to find that peter pan (one of my faves as a child) was also closed as well as most of adventure land, they may as well of shut pirates of the carribean and closed that part of the park altogether. Then to find yesterday as we went into the Disney studios that the  rock and roller coaster  is also closed just topped it off as it was another coaster that my daughter could of fit on yet it was not possible again. To add to it was when we cued up for the new  ratatouille  ride we were told shortly after that there were technical difficulties and we could not go on. I think that disney should either of concentrated there efforts on certain rides at certain times and not all at once or at least offer a discount ticket as you are not getting the whole experience from a ticket that is the same price with all the rides open.",-1
"Avoid like the plague. To long of queues for to short of a ride. Food rip off and terrible, cold drinks ran out on quiet day. No Disney characters out and about have to q for Mickey and others. Was total nightmare and other parents felt same   we DID NOT feel the magic.",-1
"Compared to HK Disneyland, Paris Disneyland was very disappointing. Even our children 6 & 8 voiced their concerns as we went around park. Too many line up's, the fast passes do not work effectively. Limited English communication with some staff and quite abrupt. Very expensive. Not much shade and therefore on sunny days be ready to get burnt !",-1
"Grime, mold, garbage, general decay and lack of the Disney    shine.    Rides were not just smaller and different, but uninspired and in desperate need of upkeep. For instance, the Indiana Jones ride was simply a carnival roller coaster built around an aging, molding temple badly in need of a cleaning. People smoked everywhere, which made standing in line a whole different experience. There was mold on the park signs, too, which I   m sure would have horrified Walt. Not good. If you   ve been to Disneyland or Disney World, don   t bother with Paris     just go to the Louvre instead and save yourself a disappointing experience.",-1
"OK so we took our 11 and 8 years old to Disneyland Paris in the Easter Holidays. We drove and the as the first thing you see as you approach the park is a row of toll booths for the car park and that's a cost of 25 Euros per day so make sure you factor that into your budget. We went for two days which still wasn't quite long enough (although it should have been, more on that later). After the toll booths the car park isn't far at all and we easily found a space on both days. The next thing you have to do is get to the ticket desks, this is quite a walk and although there were airports style motorised walkways a lot of these were broken and not working. So we queued for some time and bought our tickets and then queued to get into the park. We decided to go to Disney Studios Park first as it was smaller and there were less rides we planned to go on there. (this is a handy tip so if you can plan the rides before you go it will save you some time on the day). We queued for a couple of rides which we ended up being turned away from as they had broken down! Which was a lot of wasted time. Our daughter also wanted to meet Moana so we bought her an autograph book but then found out there was an hour and a half queue to see her! This was sadly much the case for all of the meet and greet characters and we only got to see a couple as we happened to catch them 'setting up'. A lot of them also finished quite early on the day so go to them first thing of it's something you want to do. We went to see the car Stunt show which was also cancelled last minute so more time wasted. We did go back on the second day and it was very good. We spent most of the second day in the main Disney park. There's lots to do here but again be careful as although the park didn't close until 22:00 a few on the rides closed at 17:00 and 20:00 which we weren't aware of and so we missed a few things we wanted to do. Another tip is not to eat in the main area unless you want to pay   15 for a burger. On the second day we found out there's a McDonalds and other restaurants much better priced near the entrance of the parks. We had a 'fast pass' ticket which I would highly recommend as some of the regular queues were 90 minutes long or worse. However its all done manually and could do with an update. Overall I would say its worth a trip here for 2 or three days. However it is quite stressful and the staff aren't particularly helpful.The fireworks are worth seeing which are on when the park closes.",-1
"Was really excited to visit disneyland however 2 of the first roller coaster rides we visited were out of order for the whole month.. no good to me.. we continued on and went on a few rides, but each ride had about a 20   45 minute wait. U spent majority of your time in lines than actually enjoying the park. (need a whole day to really enjoy everything)I did enquire about an express pass.. but they said none left. which didn't make much sense to me considering when i entered there actually wasn't an express line.",-1
"Q's are a disaster, fast pass more often than not closed, staff are very poor it's like they wish there was no kids around. This is suppose to be a magical place for kids and the staff working there should be part of making sure the experience is the best it could possibly be, it's a far contrast to Florida, rides are far to short after queuing over an hour. Food is average and everything is way to expensive. Had to Q in a line with vomit and the staff had no interest in cleaning it up disgraceful",-1
"this was my 3rd visit to Disneyland with my family, always had a wonderful time, unfortunately, this last visit was spoiled with the fact I had my money stolen out of my purse which was in my handbag at the security screening by security staff, please try not to be alone, especially once it starts to get dark, try and keep your money on your person, hope this helps and it doesn't happen to you.",-1
"It seems Disneyland Paris is going downhill fast. It was our fifth visit to the park and it's going to be our last, the only magic you have now is how much money they try to squeeze out of you which wouldn't be such a bother if the entrance fee wasn't 100     per day.It looks all dated and in need of refurbishment which also takes a lot magic away. We were there over the weekend in januari so not the busiest time of the year but waiting times for the popular attractions were well over a hour with a peak of 180minutes for ratatouille. Instead of doing something about it Disney decided to make special fastpasses called super and ultimate fastpasses ofcourse against a hefty price starting from 30    day for 3 attraction (so 10    attraction) to 150    per day per person for all attractions.We ate at the Agrabah Caf  , for the 3rd time and my god has the quality gone down. Seems like budget cuts everywhere but prices go up. With still an hour to go into the service they weren't happy to keep the buffet stocked. Food itself was barely warm.In general the staff doesn't seem happy anymore to work for Disney and do the bare minimum which results in long waiting lines and waiting times. Organisation is not what it should be and that's the fault of managment. I can imaging if you are a first time visitor you are still impressed enough to miss such things but we can compare it to how it was 10 years ago and it has gone downhill and it's going downhill faster. I hope the promised investments will pay of but I suspect it will only mean everything will be even more expensive.",-1
"The lines for rides are too long. Yes, the fast passes help a little but standing in line for an hour  only to get a 5min ride is ridiculous. This was my 3rd trip and I feel like it keeps getting worse and longer. There's more people and less space and rides to go on. This could just be the days I've gone on but I think I'll be sticking to other parks that aren't as busy. I'm sure however if you're here with young impressionable children they will love it and not notice that. I'm just past the age where I can stomach this kind of work to reward ratio.",-1
"Totally agree with the comments above that DISNEY it,s about time, YOU stop being a rip off and cheating people. I mean even with an annual pass, the parking and everything and the wait times are RIDICULOUS.",-1
"its smal, old and dirty. construction, rubish and faded colors everywhere. i was in other disneylands and this one is simply bad. it doesn   t deserve the name disneyland..   go in hollywood stuidos!! trust me!! so much more worth for the money!!",-1
"Dont waste your money going to Disneyland, we spent over   200 on tickets for 1 day for a family of 2 adults and 2 kids for 1 park and only got to go on 4 rides all day! The queues are massive, 3 hour waiting in queues...Thats not enjoyable for kids or adults. The rides are nice to look at but very boring, no thrill! My youngest really wanted to see Mickey Mouse but he was no where to be seen and neither was any other character! Very dissapointing day for our family...",-1
"Let us start with the good stuff.Park is clean, the parades and firework display are fantastic, so why the 1 rating?Staff attitude. Shocking and disgusting. Rude 90 percent of the time.Disorganised. The rocket ride had three cast members, two going around together slowly and third to press a button. The photo app doesn't work in the park! The photo opportunities were very linited, for   60 we got 12 photos.Rides breaking down. Five of the limited rides broke down during the ride.Expensive . Our character dinner for adults and a child would have been   210 had we not been on a meal plan. Most all you can eat would have been   80.Children good options. Very limited.Tried contacting them, no response after our visit Avoid !!!!!! ",-1
"We wanted to get away from our whistlestop tour of Paris (art, food, the Eiffel Tower etc) and just get back to some good old American theme park fun for a day. We've been to many theme parks and Disney really does generally excel. At least in attention to detail even if not the rides. For Europeans Paris is a lot easier to get to than, Florida but the experience is far inferior save that it feels much more compact. It's easy to get to from Central Paris. About 40 minutes on the RER for    7.50 and you're there. We didn't buy tickets in advance but bought two park one day passes from the movie park where there was no line and few people at 10am. (Looked busier in the main park). Our youngest was 10 and we visited on the first weekend in April.You can buy advance tickets (eg at FNAC stores in Paris) It all feels so small compared to America! But that on the other hand means you can do it all in a (busy and planned) day assuming your kids aren't too young and have some stamina. On the other hand the crowds must be horrific at peak times. There seem to be a lot of locals with annual passes. We started at the movie park and knocked off all the main rides and the Armageddon show by 1. But really   Armageddon!! This movie was consigned to cable reruns long before our kids were born so the branding was irrelevant. The show though was pretty good. Quick 5 minute walk over to the main park where a parade was in full swing. Then the usual Disney Fastpass games of trying to not line up for too long at the big attractions. Space Mountain was excellent and then regular disney stuff was up to par. Pirates of the Caribbean fun, it's a small world world as expected and the kids really had fun in the Alice in Wonderland Maze even though they initially thought it was for the little kids. Star Tours   the Star Wars ride was very dated; dated rides are fine for the classics (like Pinnochio which had a very short line when we visited) bit disappointing for other attractions which depend more on technology than cuteness. Unfortunately two of the main rides were closed. Indiana Jones and the Crush Coaster. Although mentioned on the website this was disappointing so always best to check. Disney should really plan their maintenance better to avoid two major rides being out. Mixed experiences with the staff. Very friendly usually but in a few cases were unable to give clear directions in English and seemed like they were doing us a favour. Really not like America!Food was comparable in price to Paris. We brought our own lunch to avoid the fast food. Tickets were expensive. Even with a discount. The reality is that if you or your kids are Disney fans this is good fun. If you're not hooked on Disney the premium payable for the Disney factor is debatable as many of the rides are disappointing. To be fair both the teenagers and the younger one said they had a great time but they certainly preferred Animal Kingdom and Universal in Orlando and the rides at Alton Towers. By. 7.30 we had done seen all we wanted. Perhaps we were lucky with the crowds. Line times were overstated sometimes (45 minutes for our second Space Mountain ride was only 30 minutes for example) and by late afternoon other than the few large rides, waits were 5 minutes for many of the rides. In summary, unless you're a big Disney fan or have younger kids I'd probably avoid simply due to the cost (unless you're not worried about the money in which case he kids will have fun!). Budget on a mid range 32gb iPad Air for a family of 5 with a picnic lunch, a few drinks and ice creams and a couple of Disney pins. Obviously you can spend a lot more and there are different costings if you stay at the park or buy some sort of package. Poor overall from an adults perspective. Especially on value for money. ",-1
"We bought a 4 days for the price of 3 ticket but feel we didn't need that long as we had had enough after 2 days really. Being half term we did expect it to be busy but the queues were very long particularly the 'thrill' rides. Although these usually had fast passes you had to wait a long time to use these and for certain rides could only go once eg Ratatouille or wait over 60 minutes to go again. I was particularly disappointed with the princess pavilion my daughter and I queued for 75minutes to see ONE princess. They also forgot to ask if we had met any before so we were put in the line for Cinderella. When I realised that was it, I complained, initially I was told this was my fault but eventually the person at the front realised their mistake and we met Ariel. My daughter was disappointed because Cinderella (who we had met at the Auberge for dinner) had led us to believe that we would see Belle at the Pavilion. I Could not believe you only saw one princess. Having been fortunate enough to have been to Disney in the US when we lined up to see the characters in Epcot there were 5  to see. There were also many more encounters within the parks without the painful wait. We too disliked the number of smokers within the park that had no regard for children non smokers. We took our own food and drink in which did save us some money entry was enough!! We bought popcorn at great expense!Have to agree with comments about the condition we too noted various cars in rides that were not in use and this surely prolonged the wait times. Regarding baby swap  this seems to cater for families of 4 not 5 or more. If the parent who was looking after the baby or child too small for a certain ride then wished a turn they had to chose between the child they travelled with rather than go as a unit like the other parent had before. This led to arguments between the children who were both keen to go again. Did enjoy the fireworks but agree these should be done earlier. We went on Halloween when the park closed at 7pm so they were 20 minutes before and our 5y old could watch which was great. Otherwise they were at 9.40 which is just too late. Another note for any uk visitors the prices in uk disney store for many of the items eg frozen are cheaper with current exchange rate",-1
"I have been to Disney World and on paper, it makes Disneyland look like a joke. I went in having positive thoughts, but just did not have a great experience all around. The rides (comparing to Disney World) are actually a lot shorter (with the exception of Pirates of the Caribbean). There really isn't a hole lot to do in these parks. Due to wait times, we pretty much spent the entire day at Disneyland till the park closed. The prices on food are very pricey and the quality in my opinion is very poor. I didn't care to much for the staff at here. In Orlando, everyone has such a different attitude. I came across a couple rude employees and unhelpful ones as well. Not mention that throughout the day, certain rides were going down and not functioning. That is by far the last thing that I would expect from Disney. All in all, if you can go to Florida, by all means.... go to Florida and do not waste your time here.",-1
It wasn't worth the money over crowded did get to see many characters the ones my kid got to sign her book was at the character breakfast only didn't get on but two rides because of the time waiting 1hour in the half each wait it was not fun at all I wish I never paid my money but the character breakfast was outstanding. ,-1
"Just came back from Disney Paris.   Actually it' our second time.   This time we had nice time only because of our good spirit. The rides were extremely crowded and not everything has a fast pass. Grown ups squash us when they see me with 2 small children and take our place.   In all the corners of the park and on the green areas where we lined up for the rides you see cigarettes, papers and garbage. Bees are everywhere and they chase you to death if you have a lollipop or anything sweet in your hands.   So, imagine what happens if a bee attacks my 1.5 years old baby while eating anything sweet.   The toilets are filthy.   It looks like they are cleaned only once a day when the park closes or maybe not at all.   Peter pan ride needs maintenance as at the end of the day it feels like it's boats are going to crash.   It's not the same when you ride it in the morning.   A lot of the rides were not working and we were very disappointed.   The staff in the rides are not friendly.   Maybe they were also affected by the financial crisis? They were dull, not funny, not smiley, it's like someone has cut off their salaries and work for free and they are not happy about it.   Or maybe they feel bored doing the same thing every day??!! Even some of the characters were dull and felt like they want to get over with it like  belle  whose lips were sealed and she had that  don't come near me  all over her though we were the first ones to greet her.   Maybe she didnt speak English????   Everything is extremely expensive.   The food, the toys, the gifts.   This is supposed to be a place to have fun and it's ok to spend but all over it certainly is overpriced.   It's like you are being robbed.   Imagine if you have 2 kids and they want each a costume which are priced at 60 and45 euros, you end up spending only on the costumes 105 euros without the accessories.   Not to talk about the food cause you can somehow break your child's heart and don't get them the costumes but you can't stay without food. Generally, the park is not like it was before, it needs a lot of maintenance and cleaning. Rules and regulations across the park need to be reviewed, like some priority or rules need to be set for small children so that they don't get squashed or their places taken by inconsiderate grown ups. And generally disney's concept need to be reviewed when it comes to the staff's attitude and the prices across the park.",-1
"It was so over crowded that the dream did turn into a nightmare! one could not stand stil    keep mooving!  any staff member would shout! no kindness, no magic whatsoever! I would never ever go back on new years eve again. It was disrespectfull to people that pay a lot of money for the tickets, travel great distances and find themselves treated like cattle... or worse.",-1
Well .. Disney is great around the world with their happy smiling staffs. NOT here. The people who works here mostly have sad and angry faces. They will shout Instructions and man handle you if you look like Chinese. Or course if you are Anglo Saxon they treat you differently. What a regret that we choice HKG as the destination for our 2nd Disneyland visit this year. Tokyo was way way way better. Th attitude and behaviour of the ground staffs has made this a horrible place to be.,-1
"We visited this park in March, assuming this would not be a full crowded season, but it turned out to be very disappointing. We stood in line the whole day (even while using fastpass lanes). Many rides were closed for remodeling (Space Mountain and Pirates of the Caribbean   which in themselves are the whole point of going to Disneyland). Paying full fares to stand around in never ending lines in the cold was hard on the children. Disneyworld Florida is crowded as well but offers many more ride options. If you do decide to go to Disneyland Paris, make sure you pay the extra 15 Euros to get the flexible pass that allows entry to Disney Studios and get more for your money    but I sincerely doubt it. We just felt completely ripped off.",-1
"Impressive when you walk in, but that was were it ended, wasted most of the day either walking around trying to find everything or lining up for up to 45 minutes, not impressed.",-1
Came on a Friday at the end of February. Was looking forward to an empty park. Didn't work. Massive queues everywhere (some up to a full hour). Short rides (less than two minutes for many). Fastpasses were finished by 13:30. To be fair   my six year old daughter said she had a good day. But she had a better time the next day in Luxemburg gardens and the Rodin museum. If you still want to go   get the tickets in advance online. Plan your visit with all the information on the website. Utilize the fastpass system   it's free and saves a lot of time. Come with a lot of patience and think of things to do while you stand in line for hours on end. ,-1
"If you love Disneyland? Skip Disneyland Paris, because you will be disappointed! First there are very few rides, half of the restaurants were closed, you have to wait in line to make a reservation to meet a princess, then come back and wait for your reservation! They let people smoke in the park, people cut in line and the people who work there don't care! The service sucks, the employees are rude, and act like they hate their jobs! The park is dirty, the restrooms are small, AND dirty, there are very few garbage cans, and no benches to sit on, rides were closed or broke down often, and you can't get any information from anyone, because they just don't care. It was the worst Disney experience I have ever had!",-1
"The park is so small, with so few people and performances that it is almost depressing. There are no new rides there either so if you are a long time Disney person you won't find anything new or exciting. You will be much more pleased with Shanghai Disney which is only a short two hour flight away.",-1
they don't have as many rides as other Disneys.  Easy to get to.  Charge a fortune for bag storage but there are cheaper lockers if your bag is not big. Castle is still being built so not great yet.,-1
"Cost us nearly 500 euro for 3 kids (11, 10 and 8) and 2 adults, 9 rides in total where under refurbishment between the two parks these included Thunder mountain, Swiss family robinsons treehouse, pirate galleon, Pirates beach, adventure isle, star tours, neptunes submarine, Armageddon and rock and roll coaster. Here's a little hint to Disney......I understand rides need to be refurbished but how about you discount the tickets for how many rides that are undergoing refurbishment. This is the only place in the world I have seen that you pay full price for half the park.. What a joke and to think this cost me $700 Australian dollars entry for 4 hours to complete both parks....Never again!!!!!",-1
"Everyone was rude, pushing in infront of the children. The queues were too long and slow moving. It was too busy and far too expensive.",-1
"We booked a stay at DL 3 years ago and while it was a wonderful experience, the amount of e mail spam we receive is totally out of control. They take your email address and immediately spread it around to dozens of their businesses... vacations, movie clubs, merchandising, etc., and even if you unsubscribe from one it doesn't remove you from all the others. So you never know when a new Disney solicitation is going to invade your in box. It's terrible that after 3 years I have opted out of more than a dozen different Disney solicitations (itball began with one single vacation reservation) and yet this spam is still showing up. Today I got one from Disney Digital Books. I opted out of this one too, but who knows which new Disney business the next spam will come from. Really frustrating.",-1
"If your idea of vacation and happiness is spending more time standing in lines then anything else, then Disney is the place to be.",-1
"The word around the park when we were there for School break was  I need my Disney Fix . Well a person who has been to Disney (in Flordia) numerous times, this is not the location to go if you are on the European side of the water. The feel, look, operation and name a few things were not even close. Moreso, when you buy premium tickets to use the  Fast Pass  and the ride does not use them or you are given an excuse that they only use fast pass on the weekends make no sense. The only solution is that Disney either fix the park or remove the name. I can honestly say the Family was let down and it was a  Bust  or better yet a waste of time.",-1
"The park is looking tired, with little investment evident in some areas. The Alice in Wonderland is a collection of chipped paint and faded colour. Queues around the park are usually well managed, with excellent signage telling you how long the wait is. Not at the Princess Pavilion. Poorly signed, it turns out you have to queue to get a ticket to see one princess, and if you aren't there to queue between 10.30 and 11am, forget it, all tickets for the whole day are gone. Then you come back at your timeslot, go in, only to find yourself in a dark, cold corridor, no staff, nothing for the kids to do, and in another queue for over an hour. If you come here in the afternoon you have absolutely no chance of a ticket, and I saw a large number of disappointed families as a result. Waiting in a dark corridor for over an hour means you will witness quite a few mini meltdowns, and frankly who can blame them? The food throughout the park is abysmal   the only edible meal we found was Annette's Diner, just outside the entrance to the Park and Studio, and here service was very slow. Fresh fruit and the like nowhere to be seen, which seems such a shame for a family venue, the small concessions consistently ran out of food items, and the staff in them were incredibly slow and rude. The buffet meals were indescribably bad. Seating around the park, for eating or just resting, is ludicrously under provided, everything overpriced, and it's a shameless rip off. Even my kids could see that this place offered poor value for money and poor entertainment much of the time   the rides are not exactly interesting or exciting, with a few notable exceptions. We couldn't wait to leave, and won't be going back.",-1
"My wife and I went here on out last day in HK for a bit of fun, just the two of us. Three years before, we went to Disneyland Paris with out two kids and had an amazing time. Sadly, Hong Kong Disneyland was a massive disappointment. ",-1
"If you go and are expecting a Florida Disney World experience you will probably be disappointed. The lines were extremely long. People were smoking while standing in line and every time the line stopped moving it seemed like everyone jumped up on the railings which made the wait even longer as everyone climbed down to move forward. We waited in line for the Aerosmith Roller Coaster for over two hours. Apparently, just as we reached the inside of the non air conditioned building the ride broke down, we don't know what happened because no one made and announcement. After sitting on the floor for another 30 minutes without moving we just left. After nearly 8 hours we managed to only get on three rides. On a positive note, I will say that the two meals we ate in the park were reasonably priced and good.",-1
"THE GOOD   the rides themselves, the theming, the mild sense of the 'Disney magic'.THE BAD   lots of breaking away from the core brand values:my god, the staff are slow; uninterested, demotivated, rude and all move at the rate of a snail. It took 25 minutes to get a coffee in a very small queue line. Tired theming which needs the magic putting back in.Use of hoarding to hide closed refurb attractions   very un Disney.Food quality acceptable but not out of this world.Range of food outlets is odd and very little in the way of traditional indoor coffee shops, it's not very pleasant collecting a machine dispensed coffee from the cashier in the gift shop.Very little indoor seating which for Paris is necessary.Essentially it's just Alton Towers with less emphasis on good customer service and the audacity to use the iconic Disney name and brands.",-1
"This was my 2nd time there. I bought the combo entrance from a website 'klook' which was inclusive of the entrance fee & a meal. As there are 13 of us which some were muslims, the only halal cafe will be the one at the Adventureland...& it was closed on that day. It wasnt stated on the Disneyland website or neither am I been notified or been highlighted that the cafe will be closed on that day (when i actually hv to specify the date i am going upon booking). We hv to search high & low for a halal cafe & was given ONLY 2 choices of meal which indeed was lousy taste. Some of the games were closed & the rest does not meet my expectations. So as the parade too...very boring. ",-1
"We have now been here almost 4 hours and managed to get on 1 ride (tram tours) which didn't work properly. Waited for the toy soldier ride for an hour and then was told it's not working. Waited for 30 minutes for a restaurant to be told it's full. Went to another ride and told it's not working. Will be complaining to Disney.   266 wasted. Disorganised, staff unfriendly. After visiting Disney in Florida, Disney Paris has a lot to learn! Crap!! ",-1
"This is our second visit to Disneyland and maybe our last! We knew it was going to be busy on the holidays but what we dealt with was ridiculous! Last time we came during the summer holidays and it was 5 star all the way this time not so much! Using our park hopper tickets on one of our days was useless for a while as Disneyland was full so we couldn't go from park to park! The Fastpass system was useless by lunchtime as they were all taken! I feel sorry for the people who were there for a once in a lifetime trip! Walking from place to place was also a nightmare! Disney needs to catch up with the rest of the world and design a Fastpass you can pay for so first timers and people from far away can pay the extra money and get around the park! We felt that this time we did not get value for money and left with sore backs, sore legs and a bitter taste in our mouths! Please Disney think about your park capacity and ways to cater for people during busy times! Oh and if you want to get into the Frozen show good luck! Congratulations to Disney in the profits you have made in the last two days!",-1
"If you want a nice day out this is a good choice but do NOT expect a magical Disney experience in Paris. The staff are incredibly unfriendly   I did not meet a single friendly member of staff in the parks. The food is expensive and sub standard. Some of the rides are old and irrelevant, the characters do not circulate the parks and on the rare occasions you spot them they do not stop. I think the main difference between the real Disney (Florida) and this embarrassing excuse of an European version is the awful staff.",-1
"We visited the park the day after Memorial day figuring that the holiday weekend was over and the lines would not be unreasonable. Boy, were we wrong! The local schools apparently get both the holiday and the day after off and the park was absolutely packed with local kids! There were hour  long waits for everything there! If you are going to be there anytime around a holiday, you may want to call ahead to get a local's perspective on what to expect.",-1
This is a very nice place if it was not for all the crowds. Having to wait for more than an hour for all attractions and long queues to the restaurants makes it very tiring. Its very expencive too so beeing there for 7 hours and having been to 5 attractions made it not worth it. We were there when they opened on a monday in august. We will not return. Our smaller tivolies in stockholm is much more fun as you get value for your money.,-1
"I have been to Disneyland 6 times in my life at various ages and this was the first trip taking my own children. The magic has changed. Here are the challenges:Crowded. Disney has become a hangout on the weekends for the residents of OC and I totally understand that, it is in their backyard. That makes the weekend days literally packed to the point where you seriously cannot walk down the streets.Long lines. Not all rides have Fast Passes and some you would think should don't.Closed rides. We did not realize know that several major rides were closed. It's a Small World, Big Thunder Mtn, Splashdown, and finding Nemo were all closed at the same time? That left very little selection of the other popular rides which made the lines even worse.Rides breaking. It took 3 days for my parents to finally get on to Indiana Jones because ti kept breaking. I waited over 45 mins inside Indiana Jones while they tried to fix it. Pirates broken down as well while we were on it and waited 45 mins in the dark while they fixed. And Cars broke down too! It was crazy and disappointing not to mention wasted valuable vacation time to navigate the crowds and lines elsewhere.Travelling with kids and thinking you can do the switch out at the front of the line does not always work so be prepared to wait longer so everyone can do the rideNot as clean as it used to beEarly Morning entry did not include some major rides which was frustrating even though those rides are in the open sectionDid I mention long lines?Summary:I guess the condition of the park was surprising. Run down some. The staff still amazing.The food options limited due to closures. The souvenirs expensive of courseThe tourist destination feel gone (at 3 pm and all weekend the park fills with locals)The parade was great despite Cinderella's demotionI miss the gondola, the people movers, and of course not being able to show my little girls it's a Small World. Grrr We really would have reconsidered our trip had we known. We saved a ton of money to take the grandparents away for their birthdays and have our first trip to Disney as a family. So check ahead on the rides. Also go during the week. Avoid the weekends, and holidays and the afternoons when people get off work and school for a better shot at rides and less crowds.At the end of day, the girls loved it still which is all that matters but were worn out from the crowds fast. So many tired, hot, sad, crying, kids there:( and strollers everywhere! Very different if you have not been back there since the 90's like me.",-1
"Our bag was stolen at the Disney security centres. It was my goddaughters birthday gift and we lost passports, money, keys, everything. We received no help from security, suddenly they didn't speak English, the hotel refused to accept a transfer of money so that we could eat and drink and my goddaughter got to wait for 10 hours outside the park while we were interviewed by the police and with the embassy to get us home. It's cost us over   1000 to get home not including the wasted money on the trip.Two weeks later we have had nothing, not even an explanation from Disney, a large company thinking they can just ignore customers, but happy to take our money. This is a place for kids and adults? They cant even make us safe and secure at their own security centres. How many other people have been through this? Disgusting behaviour, Disney should be ashamed, the 25th anniversary of poor.",-1
"Have been 6 times to Disneyland Park since 1999 and never had I had such poor experience at Disneyland Park even during Christmas time. This time was different, and I am turned off enough not to go there again. Very crowded, rides do not open on time or keep closing due to technical difficulties, the management team on the ground is clearly overwhelmed by the overcrowding at the park, particularly visible during parade times. While we took advantage of the magic morning to get into the park early, the day we went had Splash mountain, Hyperspace mountain and Matterhorn bobsled all open late due to technical difficulty. Haunted house had to close temporarily due to technical difficulty while we were right at the top of the line. Tomorrow Land has Star Wars ride and Super hero exhibits and has barely space to walk. A few food comments as usual:Compared to the non vegetarian options, the veggie food options are pathetic. On Main Street you get Pretzels, New Orleans area has cold Salad, if you are by the Splash mountain and hungry you get fries. There are very few decent veggie meal options and long walks to get to any of those decent options: Veggie skewers at Adventure Land at Bengal Barbecue, cold sandwich at tomorrow land, cheesy pizza at tomorrow land, and burger at fantasyland. Veggie skewers are hit or miss, some of the veggies were not grilled fully and were half baked. Certainly adding veggie hot meal options that are easily accessible in many restaurants across the park would be good. In summary, compared to all my past visits, this visit made me feel the magical experience is fading. Very commercial experience. Mickey I feel seems to be taking the foot steps of Scrooge McDuck, so very much a good bye from me. ",-1
"I first went to  disney Land in Floriday 20 years ago and at that time it seem dated and poor versus the other parks in Floriday. 21 years later it's exactly the same and now seems very dated with a large number of terrible rides that people are willing to queue for over an hour for what they can get at their local fairground. Basically, one big rip off with very few Mickey's and Minnies walking round for autographs and as per most things Parisian expensive and terrible service.",-1
"I am a huge Disney fan Huge! We have had annual passports for all of the parks at one stage or another   often for years. Paris always disappoints us  we only go every few years (after we have forgotten how sad it is!). The rides are good  brilliant even. The environment is as you would expect, although a little run down and lacking in the magic again! But it is one simple fact that destroys it   it is without the soul of the other parks. There is no happiness in the staff. There are few smiles and no one wishes you a good day. The people on the gate frown at you or ignore you when you enter. I speak a good amount of French and I asked if I needed a stamp to re enter (At the gate where the stamps were supposed to be given out!) and they ignored me. The staff in the merchandise shops hardly spoke. Another thing I find amazing is that the food is so average   It's Paris for goodness sake. I don't want to eat doughnuts that look half stale. They don't bother to hide works when they are redoing something. There are no picture covered hoardings here   just brown material. So, if you are visiting Paris Disney and you haven't been to Tokyo, Hong Kong or the American Parks and you wonder what the fuss is about, please please please don't take this park as being indicative of the magic you will find elsewhere   a magic that is most often created by the enthusiastic and helpful staff you will meet in the other parks, who often love (and are as fanatical about) Disney as much as I do!",-1
"Having done Disneyland Florida in 1981 as a 6 yr old, the intention was to take our 2 8yr olds before they were too old, to Euro Disney.....to take in the magic.Well, having checked into great accommodation courtesy of Centreparcs Village Nature a 30 bus ride away, we started the first of two days with Disney.Weather doesn   t bother us and we are pretty travel aware having been to many countries. However, the queues in this place were unreal. You expect to wait to get in ...everyone is likely to arrive as it opens etc. Its the rides...on the first day we managed 3 rides between 10am and 5 pm. 3 rides ...of which we queued for one for 2 hours. Normally, we would have just left but the children were there and once you commit to the wait, you are just too angry to leave the queue. That ride lasted 2.16 minutes ! More fool us. Food and drink onsite is costly and most bring their own. There are not loads of places to sit and eat it   most multi task whilst standing in the queues. Most staff were helpful apart from one who would not replace a broken pin badge fastening for my son who had owned it 30 minutes. No replacement fastener or offer of a refund just a non chalant    you buy another    . It   s a badge ffs, just take one off another badge and give us it   however, that staff member was not the norm   most were fine. Disney is obviously a huge enterprise, shops galore, over priced tat mostly unless you are die hard Disney of which we saw many. However, we wanted to do the old fashioned getting autographs of characters, meet characters for photos and there was very little of this. In two days in two parks we found one Goofy...both kids dissapppinted.In fact, far from being a memorable experience, both kids on the second day asked to go back to the village Nature accommodation to use the Centreparcs facilities.If we divided the cost of Disney between the rides we managed to get on (3 on day one, 5 on day two) then we have been sorely wripped off.",-1
"This was our 15th trip to Disneyland and we are avid Disney fans, but this trip left us very very disappointed. We queued 75 minutes to ride Indiana Jones and we sat in the seat and it broke down, we queued the next day for 65 minutes and it broke down again. Space mountain and Big Thunder Mountain were also broken down. Queues were ridiculous with hardly any staff around to give information or to 'police' what was happening. The quick service restaurants were anything but quick service! This trip was a very very expensive disappointment..",-1
Just finished 2.5 days at Disneyland Paris and was very disappointed. The prices are shockingly high the wait times for rides was ridiculous. All the big rides had more than 60 minutes of waiting. To me this trip solidified that Disney only cares about the bottom line as they clearly had too many people in the park and were unable to accommodate. I am actually ok with the high prices as I honestly expected to pay extra for the experience. What is unacceptable is the waiting for everything..as other guests mentioned you literally cue for everything. The only way to see everything is to stay for an entire week because you will literally be in line the entire time. Seems like numbers through the door are far more important than quality of experience. We are done with Disney. ,-1
"My partner and I paid $149 each for tickets to this park as my partner wanted to see the original Disney castle.When paying for the tickets nothing was mentioned about a couple of issues we had.Firstly we walked through and tried to take a photo using a selfie stick to be told we either have to throw it away or take it back to the car or hotel as they are banned. So we had to leave and come back again.Then once we finally got back in we saw countless people with cameras on selfie sticks which was very annoying, but not as annoying as them not pre telling us before paying that the castle isn   t even visible as they are working on it or something. It was just wooden panels with a castle painted on it so we paid full price for partial access and activities to be available to us.We should have been told as we   d have left the park for another LA holiday and not wasted $300.Disney this is unacceptable and a true disappointment The only good thing was out breakfast in the Carnation Cafe where the staff were superb and the Apple cinnamon pancakes to die for.All in all a very expensive disappointing day thanks to Disney not pre advising people at the gate as to what works were or are being carried out.",-1
"It's for my kids love of Disney that brings me to this theme place otherwise I would not come even if it's free admission. While few staff are helpful and courteous many staff are rude. All those time we come here it's always a bad experience mainly because it's so crowded, long line everywhere, parking, rides, restaurant, bathrooms etc and even malfunction of some rides after waiting an hour. The fast pass is not even worth anything. ",-1
"Was my first time to Disneyland, even from a small country, we only have one theme park and I thought it was just so so. This would be great if you were a kid, but it was not as good as I thought. The best ride was being fixed up for Halloween, so very disappointing, still had to pay full price.Strange there were lots of HK businessmen in suits... hmm place for business trips?I didn't even stay for the fireworks at the end, only stayed an hour or so then left...",-1
"I love Disney. I know that other people love Disney. I have visited Disney in Paris and Florida, I know what to expect. Californian Disney is RIDICULOUS. Over $500 for 2 adults for ONE DAY, out of season, not in Easter or a holiday or anything. We queued for ages to get on anything, we couldn't even walk around easily there were that many people there, many attractions had queues of well over 2 hours   I can't even imagine taking kids there. I feel that it was over what is a reasonable  capacity  in terms of having a good experience there, as we only got on a few rides, despite spending all day there and arriving before 8am.I wouldn't go back OR recommend.",-1
"We visited Disneyland Park on December 28 and while we were prepared to brave the crowds since it is the holiday season after all, we did not expect to see the park that packed. When you get into the parking lot, the cashier asked us if we already had tickets, which we had already purchased online. He let us in after paying the $15 fee and handed us a green ticket that stated that Disneyland Park was busy so they were not letting in people anymore. I guess that is Disney's way of lifting off their liabilities. We had the 2 day, one park per day package and were visiting LA with a 6 year old. So it is not like we had the luxury of coming back another day where it was less busy.We were still able to get in despite the extreme business. It was packed, so packed that you could barely see the grounds. I felt unsafe to get around and was holding my daughter's hands the whole time. We tried to get by during the parade so we could do some ride. Impossible.Average wait time was 50 minutes for each ride. We only managed to do 2 rides in between the parade in the 4 1 2 hours we were there. Food is awful and extremely expensive. $35 for the 2 worst hamburgers we ever had and a mini pizza which was more dough than pizza and 3 drinks, that is extreme. We also had to line up for that 20 minutes. And line up for the washrooms.It was a big disappointment for us and anything but magical. They take so much money yet make it impossible to experience more that 2 3 rides per visit. That is over $20 per ride, a rip off, if you ask me.I don't know if there is ever a slow time. Avoid if you can.",-1
"Having visited Disney world in Florida on a number of occasions myself and my wife were finally looking forward to visiting the original home of the magic in California during our march California road trip. Well where to start I would have to say if you've visited Disney world in Florida then I would give the California parks a miss, there is little or no magic that is in abundance in Florida I can't put my finger on it we so wanted to love it but it turned out to be a chore rather than a pleasure from the queuing to the staff, the tiny nature of the park the lack of organisation compared to Florida it was a real shame and we left wishing we had not visited and still therefore thought it would be magical because that it is not.",-1
"I when here just after the easter weekend with my wife and two children (5 and 3 year old girl) along with my wife sister and her partner along with their children of the same age (but boys). Expectations were high to be fair, you hear so much about Disneyland that you expect the best and of course pay a premium for such however, the trip itself didn't meet my personal high expectations and I'm not sure if thats just me being fussy or maybe just unlucky?We booked into Newport Bay hotel, which is on site and allows earlier access to the park, two hour before the general public. This hotel itself is being renovated, when we booked we were told 'minor renovations' were being undertaken but came to find the hotel covered in scaffolding and majority of the ground floor lounge etc closed. The first impressions weren't improved upon when our party got stuck in a lift for 20 minutes when trying to make our way to the rooms (which were provided ahead of check in time to be fair).The rooms itself was very standard, views were none existent due to scaffolding and builders working outside the window. The decor looked very dated and I assume is part of whats promoted the renovations (be them classed as minor or major!).The park itself   of course the kids got delirious with excitement when they saw the entrance and given their age, were happy with all the attractions and shows we took them to however, we did find a large proportion of rides close due to faults (thunder mountain, tea cups, big pirate ship, slinky dog, dumbo ..... amongst others).Cost of food in the parks themselves was extortionate and very poor quality. The waiting time for said food was terrible, we went half board and as part of the deal got a 'tea time treat'..... these were used once on all the days there as we found only a few selected places took the vouchers and those that did had waits longer than major rides!!Staff working were generally very good, cheery and happy to help except when on one ride I felt the sharp edge of a young french ladies tongue for returning a hat that had been left on the tom sawyer ride..... I was hoping to catch her name at the end of the ride but she strangely seemed to have disappeared!Character photo opportunities are plenty on the park, albeit with a sizeable queue event before the park opens to the general public. Highlight of the trip for me was the fireworks and light show at the park closing time   that was staggering and breath taking and everyone I spoke to enjoyed it whatever their age.In summary, it was mission accomplished in terms of the kids enjoying themselves however, the trip certainly didn't live up to expectation in terms of quality and value for money.",-1
"Just didn't enjoy the queues, poor customer service, closed attractions, lack of dining options and the underwhelming impression that the management couldn't really care. Oh and bring your credit card as whilst the premium won't surprise you, the lack of value for money will. Frankly if you're going to Disney sob the real thing in the US. In Europe Phantasialand is so much better.",-1
"Hi everyone,I am allergic to wheat, and when I went to the Blue Bayou for dinner the chef came out and I ordered what was supposed to be gluten free food. After dinner, I was so sick I had to stay in there clinic for many hours only to go home. Be careful of the food. It was extra sad because my boyfriend proposed that day, but we were not able to stay and celebrate because I was so sick. :(",-1
"this is my 2nd time at disneyland hongkong. first of all, if u have been to disneyland orlando u will be severely disappointed since hongkong disneyland is very small. u can walk around it in just an hour. upon entering u will have the option of getting the star pass, if u don't mind paying an extra 100 hongkong dollars per person. ticket is 399 hk dollars for adults and 285 hk dollars for aged 3 to 11 years old. let me tell u about the good stuff first. view is very nice, the parade was fun to watch but it was a short one only around 5pm if i am not mistaken. now to the bad part... oh my! i am going to start my whining. terrible food! i bought an assortment of food like hotdogs, waffles, chicken wings and pizza. waffles was decent, the other selections was horrible. i was left hungry since it galls me to buy overpriced unsavory food. disneyland staff are ill mannered and rude, and to top it off they barely speak english argh! their guttural and incoherent sentences made me stop asking questions. to be fair to them, maybe they seem rude bec they barely speak english so they can't communicate properly but still... i expected better from disneyland staff. some of the staff kept on hurrying small kids that might make them have an accident like falling etc. which in my opinion is not right. queues are very long, u have to wait for an hour per ride and then it will only take 3 to 5 minutes for u to finish the ride :( my son still enjoyed his time in disneyland, he is 7 years old so no surprise there. my tip is this, eat first before u step on disneyland. terrible food!",-1
"Disneyland Paris is an embarrassment to the Walt Disney Company. What's wrong with the park? Everything! From the time we checked in, to the time we left, the entire experience was awful. For specifics on the hotel, check out my review on the Sequoia Lodge here: yelp.com biz sequoia lod   As for the park itself, it was very poorly maintained. There was trash all over the place, rides kept breaking down and the employees were generally unfriendly. We did meet one genuinely friendly fellow in one of the gift shops that was truly delighted that I wanted to trade pins with him and even more delighted when he found out that I'm from Hawaii. But that was the highlight of our entire experience there. Food is another area the park falls flat on its face. You'd expect food at a theme park to be bad, but I wouldn't expect it to be inedible. We had a burger in the park for lunch one day, and its flavor reminded me of the smell of dog food... I took a bite and couldn't eat it anymore. And if you want to eat in one of the overpriced restaurants, you have to make a reservation the day before... for lunch or for dinner! And most of the food services weren't even open despite the enormous crowd. Granted it was November when we went, but if park attendance is that high... The wait for the rides were ridiculous too. Disneyland RR, for example, had only 1 train running. That was it. It was a 45 minute wait between each time the train went around. You'd think they'd run at least 2? Would I ever go back? No. Once was enough for me... Never again with Disneyland Paris. It's nice to have been able to gone to see what it's like, but it really isn't worth staying for even an entire day.",-1
So after saving an absolute fortune to take my family of 5 for a special break to Euro Disney we wish we'd saved more to go to florida!The park was rediculous. Two of my children got on 2 rides a day!! No queue was less than an hour and on average most were over 1.5 hours! The fast passed sold out by 11.30am and even entering the park early at 9.30 they still waited over an hour to get on one ride! So over priced. Wouldn't ever recommend anyone to go,-1
"Perhaps I had been spoiled by going to Disneyworld so many times before and set my expectations to that level. However, I was truly shocked at how inferior Disneyland was to Disneyworld. I will say that we did not go to the other park that you had to pay an additional $80 for simply for that reason. It was far too much money and it did not appear to be all that exciting. So we stuck with Disneyland.Our first visit was to it's a small world, it was one of my travel partners favorites. It was closed for repairs. We then went to try one of Doles Pineapple drinks which you can only get at this park, closed for the season. We then went over to the runaway train ride, closed for repairs. And on and on it went. It was shocking at how small it was and how they could charge full price and close half the rides. I rarely write reviews this harsh but this was unacceptable. Especially when you factor in the huge ticket price in excess of $90 each.Space mountain was open and that was fun and there were other rides that were enjoyable. Additionally, the staff were helpful and friendly however the bad far outweighed the good. Perhaps a discount was in order given all that was closed or a list out front of the attractions that were closed so people were informed. We arrived at 10:30 and were headed home by 2pm. A far cry from a visit to Disneyworld in Orlando.",-1
"So I pay $800 for the pleasure of taking a family of 4 to the 2 Disney parks, to spend many many hours lined up for rides that last on average 5 minutes. Attention to detail and quality of rides is good, however, park owners please stop being greedy   the park guests numbers allowed on any given day need to be reduced. Shame Disney shame.",-1
"This is the smallest disneyland ever, the staff are very unpleasant! Boring staff! Dissapointed with the refurbishment of tomorrowland! A very small Magic Kingdom!

40 70 minutes of queues for 5 10 mins of fun or lunch. Oh wow 60 mins to queue up for a picture with Mickie too.  Don   t come during school holidays. It   s a big waste of money and time.,-1
"What an absolutely miserable day we had at Disneyland.We arrived at around 12pm. The park was already extremely crowded, but it was nothing compared to what was to come.I would say that of the next 12 hours we spent at the park, about 10 minutes of it would have been on rides, and we were mostly there for the rides.The park clearly needs a limit on how many people can come at a time. The amount of people that were in the park was beyond a joke. It was to the point where in some places you were unable to move. There are people with prams everywhere, even at 10pm , and in a crowd of thousands of people, it simply doesn't work. It's a place that is obviously completely about the money and not about the experience.The lines for the rides were beyond ridiculous. At least an hour per ride, and multiple times in line the rides experienced 'technical difficulties', which added an extra 15 minutes   at a time.Though Disneyland is obviously a children's theme park, it is certainly not up to date with it's rides.They shut massive sections and pathways off in the park in preparation for the parades, quite far in advance. How they justify this I have no idea as when thousands of people are at a stand still while there is a massive empty path right next to them, it seems quite crazy.When we went to leave the park, the tram service that shuttles you back to carpark also experienced 'technical difficulties'. Instead of informing us of this, the staff just left us standing there. We would have waited the best part of an hour before deciding to just walk back to the carpark, which was not a short distance. There were thousands of people left having to do this with no communication from the staff. On the walk to the car, we had staff on the trams condescendingly and rudely waving at us and laughing. They were genuinely the rudest people I have come across this far in the States.It would seem that Disneyland is so full of procedure (I can only assume from being Sued) that the staff are essentially unable to make any decisions for themselves. How many Disneyland staff would it take to screw in a lightbulb? I dread to think.I have wanted to go to Disneyland my whole life, and I can say in all honestly that not only was it BY FAR the worst theme park experience of my life, but that it was one of the least enjoyable days of my life. It sure as hell is not the happiest place in the World.Between the 6 of us we probably spent $1000 USD for the day out, which is incredibly depressing considering how miserable of an experience it was. If someone offered me $1000 to go back and do the day again, I would definitely decline.As a theme park, it barely functions, the service is horrendous, and the over all experience is horrible. I could probably go on all day about how much of a let down it was, but I'm sure Disneyland don't care, as they already have our money.We would never go back, I suggest you don't go either.",-1
"We had been to Disneyland in L.A. ..................wonderful, just as Walt wanted it.The French version is a disgrace. As normal one pays  an arm and a leg  for the tickets, of which we expected, however, we were horrified to find that at each ride etc. one could buy their way to the front of the queue. They sold these at the rides. That is so corrupt and NOT Walt Disney like. The bathroom floors were wet and the stalls disgusting. NEVER, NEVER again.: (",-1
"Visited half term June 2012, parks are small & few rides. You can easily do both parks in one day if you get to studios at 10 and Disneyland parc late afternoon so save your money if you must go just get the one day ticket. Staff unfriendly and miserable (so not the Disney ethos) toilets stink and no atmosphere. Only decent rides Hollywood tower, aerosmith and indiana jones and at least 3 main rides were closed. Car stunt show was entertaining but 2 hour wait horrendous and 3000 people crammed into grandstand like sardines. Disney village very poor and expensive we ate at annette's (food cold) and earl of sandwich (revolting) shops were rubbish. Best entertainment was buffalo bills wild west show (food was ok seating good & show entertaining) suggest anyone considering going to Disneyland paris saves up & heads to Florida instead for the real disney experience.",-1
"Disneyland is so overpriced, I cannot believe how many families fork over almost $100 per person for admission. My first trip to Disneyland was in December, 1962. The price of admission was $3.25. You got a book of tickets labeled A, B, C, D, E. Most people in today's world don't know what an  E  ticket ride is. Really too bad. There has to be better places to spend your money.",-1
"We paid full price for one day park hopper for three people, at $105 apiece we felt it was very expensive. We tried to be efficient about the rides we wanted to go on. Space Mountain was broken when we got there at opening, got fast passes for the ride at noon, the return time was 8PM (is this ridiculous? I thought so). After returning at the appointed 8PM time, my family waited 70 minutes and the ride broke. They never got to ride it. Disney didn't offer (we didn't ask for but assumed they would) some type of  sorry for the inconvenience gift . We had to wait a minimum of 65 minutes for every ride with the execption of Soar'n which we got to very early in the day. Overall we paid a lot of money to stand and wait, and stand and wait, and stand and wait. We rode as many rides as possible and that would be 7 rides. For $105 each. Not a good value for the money. When we weren't waiting in line, we were trying to make our way through crowds of people. The park closes at midnight (at least it did the day we were there), and as I sat waiting for my family to wait the 70 minutes to NOT get to ride Space Mountain (I opt out of this ride), I watched at least a hundred hungry people get turned away from the only sit down restaurant in the Tomorrowland area which closed at 10. Why they would close so much earlier than the park was a mystery. I can say every employee we met was friendly and nice. But save your feet and your pocket book and go to a local amusement park, it will be much less expensive and you will have the opportunity to ride more rides!",-1
We entered Disneyland at 1pm. The sad thing is they closed all outdoor rides at 1:30 pm. Well they should have informed us before we bought the tickets. We went to Hongkong just to go to Disneyland. The tickets cost us more than 10k pesos (1617 HKD). They already know they're gonna close based on the forecast and yet they still let us buy the tickets. We only stayed inside for an hour or so. We just took pictures and rode the hyperspace mountain and took off. Bad experience. They only want the money... and didnt care if we lose it. ,-1
"After paying over   200 for my daughters (3 adults 2 children) fourth birthday to have lunch with the prince and princess's i can honestly it is a TOTAL RIP OFF1st Course   Salmon (looked revolting and lots of plates were sent back! ) im not sure i know any 4 year old who would eat Salmon and cream cheese!2nd course   Chicken in mushroom sauce   looked more like dry chicken with sick or steak burger in gravey   NOT COOKED OR   yep   SALMONAdults menu was of course Salom, scallops which came undercooked and cold   sent back only to received 15 minutes later the same thing. This attration is quite obviouly for children under 10, i dont think many teenage girls or boys would want to have lunch with a princess, and the food was for adults.This was a very expensive lunch, im so disappointed, the staff were overworked and we had to wait 15 20 mins just for a second drink.I have complained to Disney and as yet (4 weeks on) i still have had no reply  shocker",-1
"Travelled with daughter and husband and grand children aged 2 and 5 for a 5 night stay at the Sequoia Lodge Hotel.The adjoining rooms in the south wing were recently refurbished and were clean and comfortable. Rooms now have free security boxes and a mini bar, be careful as the items in the mini bar are sensored so if you remove an item to look at you will be automatically billed eg 10 euro for a minature vodka.The hotel staff were polite and generally helpful so did not experience any of the incidents of sullen unsmiling staff reported by other reviewers.One restaurant was closed so we were given vouchers for breakfast at alternative venues in the park, not a good idea as we booked the 7.30 slot to take advantage of the 2 hour guest only admission, the walk to the alternative venues was about 30 to 40 minutes so it ended being a pointless exercise and we returned to the hotel and bluffed our way into breakfast.HEAVEN   The grandchildren were enthralled from the momemt we walked through the gates to leaving for the airport. The layout is the same as Disney Florida with the same atmosphere if you are a toddler. If you are an adult however the atmosphere is more like down town Beiruit!!! The French in particular but generally anyone who is not English have one point of view, that is I have paid so I can do what I like when I like to who I like. be prepared to wait in line and have idiots push, elbow and lean on you despite holding a 2 year old to gain 2 feet of progress. In one line a french woman even sprayed aerosol deoderant at head height catching my wife in the face so she could make room for her entourage of gibbering cretins!Having through work had safety responsibility for crowds of over 100 000 the place itself is an accident waiting to happen and they did, like the man who had climbed a fence to stand on a feature garden hill to watch a parade in total darkness who was pushed and fell down the hill into thorn bushes. There is a totally insufficent number of staff to control the huge crowds that develop when these parades take place coupled with the me me me attitude that injuries will happen.Strollers for the kids were cheap at 8.99 euros for the day, if you move parks simply leave the stroller at the pick up remove your I.D slip and take it with your receipt to the pick up at the next park.Food was expensive for what it was, approx 120 to 150 euro tfor 4 adult burger meals and 2 childrens 'happy' type meals.Having been to Disney Florida 4 times in nearly 20 years I would say to anyone thinking of experiencing Disney save that little extra, look for the deals and consider staying off the Disney site and take the kids to a far happier and relaxing place.",-1
"Wait times were 2 3 hours on a  moderately  crowded Monday and fast passes were 6 hours out. Multiple rides broke down while we were in line. We rode just 4 rides in 7 hours and finally left out of frustration. I cant imagine what the day would have been like if we had kids or a stroller with us. Not a safe experience with so many people. Clearly the park cant accommodate the crowds and needs to reassess the experience of their GUESTS. Cast members were rude and angry without exception. If you have been to any Orlando parks or Universal, you will be shocked at the state of Disneyland. The lack of signage was almost comical. I am a massive Disney fan and love the other parks. Save your money and time!!",-1
I went with Family of 6 people and it cost be 78 Euros to go and come back to my hotel on the tube. First of all the queues for the rides were extremely long as staff were not very quick at doing there job. Second of all they charged extra to meet the characters there.None of the characters were around walking in parks to meet apart from a couple who just ignored us an ran off which was disappointing for me and my family.The food pricing was ridiculous and not a choice of variety for vegetarians as well.,-1
"My husband, 5 year old daughter went to Disney to celebrate his 40th and her dream to see Disneyland Castle. On arrival at the Disney hotel we were greeted Eeyore, all very excited and thought we were in for a great 5 days. Our room was nice but not really 5 star, public rooms were again pleasant but 5 star not really how I would imagine. Buffet breakfast lots of choice but not brilliant taste wise. Our first trip into the park was exciting and when we saw the castle we were all overjoyed, that was the end of the thrill, rides were disappointing, after queues of 45 mins to result in a 1.3 mins rides no fun, rides were closed, our fast track tickets not valid between 1   4 pm , and when we did manage to use them we still queued for 20 mins for a Peter Pan ride which was 70% in darkness with stars . At the end of every ride I wanted to tell the hundreds in the queue not to bother. After 2 days my little girl cried to go and wanted to stay in hotel and swim. The park lacked disney characters around the ark apart from the parade. So expensive , shops selling all disney wear , princess dresses between   65 and   100 , food awful and expensive , dinner with the princesses pre booked in UK , we saw 3 princesses and the bill with a bottle of wine   190. Everyone walked from one queue to the next with miserable faces, it was a dreadful expensive trip. A day would be long enough for anyone but I would never do it again. We were told breakfast with the characters, they didn't mention them being outside the breakfast room and having to queue for a photo, we were invited to upgrade on arrival for   200 , to have a fast track for all day, but lots of the rides did not have fast track. No no no don't go .",-1
"Euro Disney aka the financial black hole. Pay for the tickets, expensive but the kids will love it. Another 15 euros to park which turns into more fun and games at the end of the day with inadequate lighting? No picnics in the parks so decide between losing a couple of hours going in and out or paying a minimum of another 50 euros for four substandard meals in the park? If the service provided by the staff was good then fair enough but at no stage was it any good. Buying food, queue to order you food then queue to collect but check before you leave as they don't bother to compete your order. Your food will go cold as you wait for them to complete your order in between completing the incomplete order that they got wrong previously. To queue is obviously not a verb in Euro Disney dictionary as staff ignore people jumping the queue and left it to the masses to sort out. Even purchasing expensive fragile products does not bring a smile to the staff's face as they throw them into plastic bags without a bag without a care in the world. I won't talk about the toilets because there are families which read these reviews but as my friend said,  Don't look for the toilets, just sniff them out...  The only reason I give this 2 stars is because my daughter got to see the princesses in the parade. We decided against queuing for 2 hours to see the princess because we actually thought it may be a good idea to actually get something for out 160 pound investment... We went in October and the place looked run down and in need of some care which is understandable at the end of a busy high season but the lack of customer service beyond the staff in the parades is inexcusable. We will save up and visit the USA version which we hope from reading reviews will restore my opinion of a so called family company. Something 'magical' will need to occur at Euro Disney to get me to return I'm afraid.",-1
If you enjoy spending $92.00 a day to wait in very long lines you will have a great time.  the passholders have over run the parks and filled them to capacity daily.,-1
"Just spent 4 days here. basically you are spending thousands of dollars to wait in a line to park to wait in another line to get on a tram to wait in a line to get in the park to wait in line all day for anything. all this fun is split up with lots of very overpriced merchandise and mediocre food. There are a few good things, like watching your kids faces when they get to meet a favorite character or when you actually make it on a ride. then when its all done you get to wait in all those same lines again to leave. and dont forget there will be 100 thousand people pushing and shoving the whole time. Do it once if your not a local. way better ways to spend a couple grand in my opinion",-1
"We took the VEA Shuttle bus from the airport, we pre purchased our tickets but this doesnt mean you are guaranteed a seat   everyone is in the same scrum, sorry queue and you need to fight your way on. We stayed at the New York Hotel, which was great, couple of minor issues but would recommend the hotel overall. Those of us in the group who had been to Disneyworld in Orlando were disappointed with Disneyland Paris, the park just lacked the  Disney Charm  you get in Orlando. The worst thing was the smoking, there are designated smoking areas and supposedly a 68 euro fine for smoking outside of these but people are smoking everywhere regardless and with 2 small children and a pregnant member of the group it was quite unpleasant. The parks are not as clean and have to say the toilets were just disgusting. The staff varied some were just plain rude and unhelpful whilst others went out of their way to make sure the children were not stampeded by 40 year old woman who wanted their picture taken with a character first. The one thing we all hated was the total lack of manners displayed by a great number of visitors in the park. Europeans do not have the same level of manners as those in the USA and although it is not the fault of Disney there are things which could be done to improve matters.At the moment the exchange rate of GBP to Euro is very poor but the prices are crazy. To save money make up sandwiches from the breakfast buffet and take them in. They have a bag check at the front gate of the park but if you carry them wrapped in a jacket cardi they dont check and away you go. Disney Village has a good choice of places to eat but it is expensive. We ate in Planet Hollywood which was good quality and would say reasonable value for money. Annette's Diner was enjoyable but 4.80 for a pint of sprite with half a glass of ice spoiled it. Macdonalds is more expensive than home but still half the price of other places. It was however filthy and you were hit with a very unpleasant smell as you walked in the door. If you have been to Orlando dont expect the same at Disneyland Paris or you will be disappointed. But if you cant get to Orlando and want to give your kids a taste of Disney it is still worth it   no amount of money can buy the picture on their faces when they see Mickey Mouse etc right in front of them.",-1
We were disappointed in our visit here. With children over 11 being Adult prices it was an expesive day.....particularly the food and drink prices. We were there during extreme heat so didn't get to see everything because it was just too hot. Waiting in ques for rides was so hot   no relief from the heat. (Unlike the Gold Coast theme parks in Australia where there is water mist and fans to cool you) Our 13 and 15 year olds were simply too old for this place and we would have been better off sightseeing elsewhere and saving ourselves a stack of $.,-1
"We booked knowing it was spring break and lines would be long but looked forward to visiting the original Disneyland. We were blown away at how the Disney has been taken out of this park. It   s pretty close to just your average rundown old amusement park. Bus loads and I mean bus loads of unsupervised and disrespectful teenagers run rampant through the park. We spent several hours between groups in lines for the attractions and watched them ignore every sign to    stay off    etc. These signs acted like a dare to them. So here is the other problem. Fast passes and lines. Once you scan your fast pass the line often parallels the regular line. More than once we saw groups jumping a measly road to skip the regular line. Disney needs to put a second check station in to prevent the line jumpers. Only Space Mountain has this second check and you should have see the kids and even adults getting kicked out of the line. Lines for food, lines for bathrooms, lines for rides, lines for the security check (worse than and longer than the airport). Disney staff so rude that I wonder how they got a job (ok I   d be a little mad after dealing with the teenagers I just described) but tried to give them a bad day break. Glad to say we saw the original again but will go to World for the Disney experience. PS: Fastpass everything you can including all the night shows in all the parks. Sometimes it   s still not the best view but better than no view. ",-1
"My experience of this attraction was unfortunately limited to the front gates. At every stage of the trip planning process, the Disney organization was incompetent and inflexible. When their online reservation service sent us the wrong tickets (for those of you who have purchased online, you know that this is a process nearly impossible to mess up   there are several stages and repeated validations before the purchase can be made), they refused to exchange them for another date, despite (a) there being no difference in price, and (b) it being THEIR mistake. Reconciling myself to traveling on the date they sent me tickets for, I called their reservation service to change the name of the person for the second ticket   with the new date, the first person could no longer accompany me. I was assured, repeatedly, that this was not necessary. Foolishly, it seems now, I accepted these assurances, only to be told by three levels of park officials once I turned up at the Park that there was no way they could let us in. To be standing at a park gate, with two valid tickets, both paid for by me, and to have been ensured by representatives that entry was not a problem, only to be told that my only way into the park was to buy a new, full price ticket for my companion, was appalling. As a corporation, and on the level of individual service, Disney acted callously and perhaps dishonestly. I cannot stress enough to potential visitors that they should be extremely careful in their dealings with the group, because if any errors occur, even their own, they have shown themselves absolutely unwilling to provide reasonable rectification of the matter. Very crass and disheartening.",-1
"We recently booked a surprise trip for our children  aged 11 & 14. Disneyland itself was lovely & magical however it was very over subscribed. We queued most of the day. The rides and experiences were good  however there are some major issues. The staff are rude and unhelpful. The cafe areas were unclean and we didnt once sit down to a table which had been cleared. There were no maps in English as they had run out. The food and merchandise is horrifically priced and for the food, of poor quality & a healthy option is nowhere to be seen. It snowed once for 2 minutes  its supposed to snow all the time & the characters are available for the kids on sparse occasions about 40 kids deep so a photo and cuddle is out of the question. All in all, a nice day but the magical experience can only be created by yourselves as the staff arent interested.Universal studios was dire  over priced and dull. It takes about 2 hours to do the whole park. We complained and asked if we could go in the other park again  of course...if you pay again!Again, rude staff, poor quality food, unclean and overpriced merchandise.The Disney Village  open to all with restaurants etc was ok. We had our New Years Eve meal here  it was   65 per head but the only meal worth eating whilst we were there. We were sold a wild west show  turned out to be salsa  and had to wait 30 minutes in the rain to get in & another 30 minutes on some back stairs waiting to be seated but food was nice.Overall  don't bother with Paris. We spent   2000 on the trip, taxis and food for 4 of us for 4 days...save your money & go to Florida & enjoy the magic.",-1
"Went here on 05 20 17. Never have I seen such utter disregard for the handicapped, or such poor customer service. We got there just after opening. The group was my cousin and her husband and myself, wife and daughter. My cousin purchased the tickets some $700 plus worth. First thing my cousin did being from Minnesota was buy a few souvenirs. About an hour in we decided to go to the Haunted Mansion. My cousins husband has major back difficulties, so my cousin had me stay with her husband and she and my wife went to ask how we could make it easier on her husband. They came back to us and my cousin was hot. She stated that the girl at the gate told her that even the crips must wait in the line. We went back to the gate to confront the girl but she was gone. My cousins husband decided to try and tuff out the line. A one point my cousin spotted the employee that was rude to her. The employee saw her coming and removed her name badge. They argued. She exited somewhere into the ride and disappeared. I tried to calm down my cousin, She was HOT!! Finally I thought things were going better. We were in Fantasyland were my cousin decided to get a Coke. She went to the stand where they sell Coke products, She asked if the had Coke Zero, to which the person operating the stand named Anthony said if you want Coke Zero you better find a liquor store. I gave the young man a hard time but my cousin lost it. We went to the front gates where she complained. She then took her passes, souvenirs and anything else she had that was Disney and tossed them in the trash and we left the park after only a couple of hours. We then ended up over at Knott's Berry Farm where we had a great time. A day later I wrote an email to Disneyland describing my displeasure. I received a phone call and an email while I was at work. I called back and spoke to a lady named Susan. From the get go this lady basically accused me of being a liar. She made statements like our cast members would never do that. Oh my they would never say that. Well news flash Susan the little fools did do and say that. My cousins husband can barely walk and he was treated like a sub zero human. They have fools at the concession stands looking only yo get a paycheck. I know what I'm going to do. I will never set foot on a Disney property ever again. We chucked out all their DVD's. My cousin contacted me about the incident, and never wants to hear about it again. To the folks that have read my reviews in the past. I am giving you fair warning. You can this place the Happiest Place on Earth, I call it the most money hungry unethical place I have ever seen. You pay hundreds of dollars to get in only to be treated like dirt. If you want a real good time try Knott's Berry Farm. This is a place I really enjoy and your treated like a human being not a discarded piece of trash. See ya later Disneyland. You can continue your corporate greed at someone else's expense, NOT MINE!!!!!!!!",-1
"They WAY over sell the park admission. Day after Christmas we expected it to be crowded, but not like this. EVERY single land was elbow to elbow crowded and we did three rides from 9am 7pm. It was horrible! Asked our 5 year old granddaughter if she liked Disneyland the next morning, she just lowered her eyes and shrugged her shoulders. Greed has replaced invention and fun in Disneyland! Walt would be very sad to see what it has come to.",-1
"This park has none of the Disney magic     grumpy employees, untended flower beds, and the piece de resistance, a damp, musty bathroom in the Newport Bay Club hotel that went unaddressed despite a request to hotel management to clean it.",-1
"With the park gearing up for its 25th anniversary, many of the main attractions are closed for renovations. In addition many of the services and venues were not open. The weather was cool and the lines were long. It would have been nice if the rates were discounted to reflect the lack of choices right now. We also find the park was overall dated and tired. It was clean. It is still a wonder for small children but has limited appeal to teens or adults, in our opinion.",-1
"I visited HK Disney quite a while ago (Jan 2006). I was thoroughly disappointed but not enough to write a review. However, after reading so many positive reviews, I felt compelled to write one myself.Good   Not crowded; good layout; wide streets; clean; new; cheap compared to other Disneys in every respect   food, merchandise, tickets; landscaping immaculate; convenient to get to; multiple languages for guests.Bad   SIZE; lack of attractions, especially those that make Disney so fun and have made Disney so famous in America; people cutting in lines; people spitting; people sleeping on benches and bathing in drinking fountains; staff being too timid to do anything about obvious rule breakers.Okay, I am from America and grew up near Disney World in Orlando, Florida. I worked in Guangzhou, China for quite a while including the time of HK Disney's opening. Therefore, I was constantly getting news about the new Disney. Because I grew up near Disney World, Disney's defining characteristic to me is its size. It's huge! Let me list some facts so people can understand.Disney World   30,000 acres; 4 theme parks plus many others like water parks, campgrounds, outdoor parks, etc.; 24 resort hotels not including campgrounds; 99 holes of golf available; employee training center (large office complex); huge area with employee store.HK Disney   350 acres; 1 theme park; 2 resort hotels.Disney World in Orlando is less than 1 4 developed, yet still boasts all of those things. Animal Kingdom, one park, is 500 acres, which is still larger than the entire HK Disney building area. When you enter the Disney property limits, you drive for miles without seeing anything but trees and grass. Their size of the property is astounding. The parks themselves are also huge with too many attractions to finish in one day, especially if lines are long. You can park in one place and travel from park to park by monorail. From Disney's website:  If you wanted to stay in all the guest rooms in all of the hotels and resorts currently open on Walt Disney World property (at a rate of one per night), it would take more than 61 years. HK Disney is based mostly on Magic Kingdom, one of the four theme parks in Walt Disney World. Yet, it is less than half the size of Magic Kingdom. Magic Kingdom has 45 rides. HK Disney 22, and some of those are from other parks such as Animal Kingdom. Worst of all, the rides that are most popular at Magic Kingdom are not even in HK with Space Mountain being the notable exception.For quite some time before going there, I was told HK Disney is small. I was prepared for small. I was not prepared for microscopic. It's like a miniature Magic Kingdom. The castle is 77 feet tall. WDW's is 185 feet tall, over twice as tall. Main St is tiny. When we first arrived, we unknowingly walked from one end of the park to the other not understanding why we couldn't continue (took about 5 minutes). It was only after looking at the map that we realized we had already reached the end of the park.I do not agree with some of the other members on here that construction was great. I thought many things looked quite cheap. There were also a lot of things in rides that were downscaled quite a bit compared to WDW. Overall, I felt they cut a lot of corners with the park.Space Mountain is much smaller, but might actually be better. Lion King was much different, and also possibly a better show overall.I think the worst yet best thing for me was the Mainlanders. I speak fluent Mandarin and a little Cantonese so I could understand what was going on. The worst was the Mainlanders pushing through lines as if there were no other people there. They would spit, bathe in the drinking fountains, remove shirts and shoes and lounge on benches and sidewalks, spit, stare at peole like me who are obviously foreigners and make comments, etc. They couldn't figure out how to use the Fastpass machines and caused all kinds of problems in lines everywhere. They argued when they weren't allowed to cut in front of the legitimate Fastpass holders even though they themselves had no Fastpass. The undertrained staff was too scared to enforce rules for the most part.The best was the HK residents enforcing the rules themselves. At almost every ride, while waiting, an argument would break out between a HK resident and a Mainlander because of something the latter did. It was great to watch and made waiting in line quite fun.I think Disney did a horrible job planning this park. I think Disney was not prepared for the Chinese market and customers and not at all familiar enough with them from the beginning. I think the park misrepresents Disney to those that know nothing of its other parks. There have been countless news stories of administrative problems as well. Disney built its smallest park in one of the most densely populated areas in the world next to the most populous country in the world?!?! I just find it amazing that a company as big as this could make so many mistakes. To me, it all comes down to poor planning and not knowing enough about the local market. Too bad.",-1
"I grew up in Orange County, and Disneyland was a childhood icon of cleanliness, customer service and most of all Magic. I came with my grown kids and grandchildren and my grown daughter and I were shocked and saddened by so many things. The park is dirty and disorganized. The workers worn and wrinkled uniforms represented their tired and sour mood. And the attractions....so very sad. Small World has holes and tears in the ceiling with the insulation coming through!. The displays are dirty and warped in places. Many of the top rides were down, this is not a disappointing as when you finally do get on to one it is dilapidated! It was a sea of people being herded like cattle so you know the income is still there, so the question is what are they doing with the money? They are not using it for upkeep or employee training. I have to say also, I remember a Disneyland that had unique areas to experience different  magic  from around the world, this Disneyland was awash of airport style kiosks selling their tired overpriced wares. My grandchildren saw nothing of  Disneyland  this was a tawdry commercialized mimic or what we knew.",-1
"This is not the happiest place on earth, it's the most CROWDED place on earth. The lineups are not worth it. We waited an hour just to get a Dole whip. Ridiculous!",-1
"For the Name Disneyland, this place falls short on expectations. Rides like Winnie the Poo was a disappointment. Except for a few ones like the Iron Man, the 3D Show & the Indoor roller coaster, rest of which were pretty much ordinary. Overpriced food and rude agents keeps them going. No sign of disneyland's experience...Felt Sad..",-1
"This was our second visit to world of Disney. Previous time we went with our 3 kids, they had wonderful time. This time around I have to say   it was complete disaster. Huge lines, bad organization, waiting 45 minutes in line for lousy lunch, characters hiding away, 1 2 hour waiting time for any atraction, 45 minutes transfer from parking, 2 hour wait to get on the train.. Will not go there again, the magic is gone completely. Just to give perspective: we wanted to go for 3 days, ended up leaving after 6 hours completely exhausted and without any fun   our children voted   no more ever. There are much nicer places around Paris.",-1
"I used to live in Florida, and and had an annual pass for several years to the Walt Disney World resort and loved it. I've also been to Disneyland California several times, and overall really enjoy the Disney experience. But now living in Paris and having visiting Disneyland Paris twice, I unfortunately have to say that Disneyland Paris is a pale imitation of the  real  Disney experience. The parks are far smaller, the decorations (we went at Halloween and Christmas) are FAR less impressive, the employees are less friendly, the bathrooms are much more disgusting, the park dirtier, the food is even more overpriced and FAR worse, and it just doesn't feel near as magical or fun. The general visitor population is much ruder, and I swear the park is about half as lit so you can't see where you're going. It doesn't help that most people ignore the no smoking regulations and you even have people chain smoking while waiting in lines and for parades next to you. There are some benefits to visiting though for the die hard Disney amusement park fans since many of the rides are quite different (Space Mountain and India Jones are incredibly different and much more exciting) and the Haunted Mansion is far more creepier than the US versions. And we didn't hate our time there (hence the two circles instead of one). But unless you're a hardcore Disney nut, it's really not worth the cost to go out there and pay for a very substandard Disney experience. I guess if you're only other option was paying for a trans atlantic flight it might be worth going to Disneyland Paris, but really, save your money and go to Orlando. It really is much better (just don't go during summer, it's miserably hot).",-1
"We started out at the haunted mansion and the line went fairly quickly although we waited for an hour. Everywhere you go, the walkways were blocked off because the lines from the rides spilled out. Was there seven hours and got on three rides.  Hyperspace  mountain as it is now called, was the longest line I've waited in my whole life. Two hours pass and we were still only halfway through the line. The people that work there were trying their best to entertain the kids in the center with hopscotch and such so I applaud them for trying. The parade congested things up and we would have to go around the whole park or wait for a break in the parade. Definitely don't want to come back during Christmastime.",-1
"Disney spent millions of Euro, Dollar, Pounds, building this place but failed to address the basic needs of children who cannot leave their wheelchairs! The park itself is accessible by wheelchairs but I believe this is purely because strollers   pushchairs are used rather than any thought of wheelchair access. This shows with the lack of drop curbs and where they do exist on one side of a road, they are not on another.There are also NO disabled changing facilities in the park. This meant we had to change our daughter on the floor of the toilet or as we had to do leave the park and return to our hotel to change her. Something which took a considerable amount of time and had to then re enter the park. They should speak to http:  www.changing places.org  on how to fit a changing room.On arrival you can go to the  Town Hall  where on proof of disability you are given a Green Priority card which outlines the disability. This provides you with no queuing access to rides and attractions.The reason I think it looks like wheelchair   disability access is an afterthought is that all the disabled access seems to be via the access of the rides and you have to go against the flow of sometimes 100's of people to get access. Some of who do not know that and can abuse you for going the wrong way. Also on some of the rides the staff try to load the wheelchair before everyone has exited the ride! This was particular on the flying carpets.Only 4 rides in the park seem to be used with a wheelchair and even then the staff refused us access to one of the rides because our wheelchair did not look  wheelchair  enough!! Not given the fact that our daughter who is 8 and has severe 4 limb cerebral palsy was obviously not able to sit unaided in the boat! only after a very loud argument causing embarrassment and distress were we finally allowed on the adapted boat for the Small World ride. The following day we put in a complaint at the town hall. We did feel our complaint was taken seriously. The Wonderful World of Disney does not seem to apply to those children who are always in wheelchairs. The majority of rides are for transfer from wheelchair only meaning that although you can get priority access to the ride you have to transfer out of the wheelchair to ride it. Many of the rides that have transfer only access do not have suitable seating for disabled children as they are just the plastic bench seats. What was upsetting   disappointing was the fact that some of the attractions that you would expect to be able to take a wheelchair on could not, such as the Disney train that goes around the park. How difficult is it to adapt this? the boats that show the classic childrens' stories requires transfer and even the tea cups need a transfer! We did not want or expect the major rides such as Hollywood Hotel, Parachute drop etc to be accessible as these are unsuitable for a child with severe disabilities, but there is no excuse for the basic ones.We found the staff on the Buzz Lightyear ride extremely helpful and the ride was a perfect example of wheelchair adaption. A mention must go to the staff on Armageddon who prior to the show talked us through exactly what was to happen, where to stand and most importantly how to exit the attraction quickly should our daughter become distressed. We were with a member of staff throughout and felt the staff had a full understanding of our needs   constraints.Whilst the park itself is a nice walk around with the wheelchair it is a disappointment having paid to come only being able to access about 4 rides. I think some work needs doing by Disney to allow the inclusion of children who are bound to their wheelchairs. The question is will they do it? I think sadly the answer is no, because they make their money! We did enjoy our holiday as it was our first one in 8 years since the birth of our daughter, we thought Disney would understand the needs of wheelchair bound children and were left sadly disappointed.This review will be absorbed into the 1000's of families who had a truly wonderful time, which I can say we would have had we not had a child in a wheelchair.",-1
"Went with my Grandson and his family (my great grand children) age 10, 6, and almost 3 years. Having been to Disneyland Anneheim, I was expecting something similar. No chance!. It cost a fortune just for a simple meal and to have a priority and not queue it cost    40 per person so adults were getting onto the rides and children were queueing for up to 1hr.45mins for some attractions (one day the temperature was 33c and the other day it rained so hard non stop for 2 3 hours) There were no rides for small children and the rides there were limited anyway. To see some of the Disney stars we had to ask how and when they were available and to arrange to see more than one in one area we had to pay    34 for a meal for adults and    18 for children in Mickeys Restaurant so they could have their photoa taken with stars. In the stores they concentrated on Mickey and Minnie mouse and there were very limited articles on things like Woody and Buzz and shelves were not stocked from the previous day..The maps provided were inaccurate and we walked aound for ages trying to find the Arena where the Stunt Cars performed ( The best thing there!) as there were no staff members to advise us. Nothing was organised and we were shoved out of the way queueing to enter the gates at opening time. four gates and at least one thousand people pushing and shoving not queueing and my gt.grandson of 6 years was pushed to the ground by a woman and looked angry when we shouted.All in all a disapointing and expensive trip. I later discovered it was a Franchise for a French company and not Disney USA",-1
"Don't get me wrong, I don't mind to visit a small theme park as long as I can enjoy it. Disneyland Hong Kong do have the potential. However, the visitors are horrible. They keep pushing and use umbrella in a way that dangerous to taller people. Worst, at the  Small World  attraction, there was a woman let her around 5 years old kid to take a poop on a plastic bag! Yes the queue was long, but it is not an excuse for such unruly behavior. My suggestion, apply strick rules on the park and train the staff to warn the visitor!",-1
Bunch of the  good  rides were closed. The only thing that was worth   was the Ratatouille inspired ride that I think you can't get in USA. Staff not the same but they try. Food horrible. Prices horrible,-1
"We have just recently returned from a 4 day stay, this was booked last year and we visited this park a number of times over the last few years.Please be aware that there are a number of rides that are closed, they are, Thunder Mountain, River Boat, Star Wars, Pirate Ship, Tree House, Train, Rock n Rolla. It was an absolute joke, I was aware that Thunder Mountain was under going upgrades, but in my opinion for my age group of children, it was a wasted trip, I will be complaining, they are happy to take your money and keep sending emails with more offers, they just don't tell you how many rides are shut.",-1
"If you are planning on visiting Disney Land, never ever go during spring break in March, the average waiting time for the rides ranged from 45min to 2 hours all day every day & night. Also several rides were closed due to scheduled maintenance which are mostly done in March as well, but they don   t tell you about it and you still have to pay full price per ticket.",-1
"First of all, I've been a big fan of Disneyland, having visited the park many times since my father first took me in 1957. But I took my family of four last week (6 28 & 6 29) and it was NOT  the happiest place on earth  by any stretch of the imagination, with numerous ride closures and interruptions. The first indication of things to come was a distorted speaker in the Indiana Jones car that kept cutting in and out, and made that bumpy ride seem unpleasantly jarring. Then it was a Haunted Mansion closure, a Matterhorn closure, a Space Mountain closure, then Splash Mountain too, if I recall. It was one disappointment after another! We finally got a chance to go in the Haunted Mansion, but there were still technical glitches on that ride that caused it to stop along the way. The next day, we arrived at CA Adventure early enough to get our Fast Pass for the new Cars ride. We returned twice during the day, and both times the ride was down! Then, at the end of our stay, Symphony Swings closed after the first light show, contrary to what we were told by the attendant on duty. An appropriate ending for a not so happy couple of days that cost us over $1000 at the parks alone. We ended up doing a lot more walking and waiting than riding, that's for sure. With ticket prices as high as they are, I can't afford to get stung like this again. My girls can return when they're older and able to drive themselves, but I've seen enough to not need to visit again.For anyone else who is dissatisfied with their Disneyland experience I can offer this advice, (given to me by their Guest Communications dept.):  If you encounter any inconveniences or disappointments, please feel free to inform a Cast Member that you would like to speak with a manager. You are also invited to visit City Hall in DISNEYLAND   Park or the Guest Relations Lobby in DISNEY CALIFORNIA ADVENTURE   Park to register your comments. ",-1
"Husband and I visited Paris Disneyland on a thursday with high expectations. The queue to get in is very short so we were in the park 10 minutes later. As soon as we got in I notice the place is so glum and not well maintained. I visited HK Disneyland in 2008 and it was much better. We have not had our breakfast when we went to Disneyland because we planned to have it in the park. Guess what?? No restaurants or stalls are open at 10am and I was starving and did not enjoy the first two hours in the park. At 12pm we queued up for lunch in a restaurant and the buffet is extortious,    27 per person!! Being a vegetarian i did not have much choice of food in the restaurant. On top of that the place they seated us had a strong smell from the toilet. This experience really dampen our experience.Most of the rides were the same with HK Disneyland. The one i particularly enjoy which i missed in hk is Teacup ride. December is the worse time to visit this park due to : they close early at 6 pm, lots of rides are closed for maintenance and it is too cold being outside!!!Main element that i missed in Paris Disneyland are the jinggles in the metro train ride approaching the park. It really does give me the 'feel' of Disneyland.",-1
"Perhaps visiting on a halloween special day affected this but after visiting Disneyworld in Florida a few times I was excited to try the California park. I was disappointed. Everything was cramped, the way the queues were set up was bizarre, with Matterhorn in particular just sending us round in circles trying to find the end of the queue! A lot of the big rides weren't even working.The staff seemed bored and uninterested, whereas at Disneyworld they are very much actors in character and not staff   that difference was very obvious.We visited Califonria Adventure next door too which was much better   save your money and just visit there instead.",-1
"the problems i found with the whole eurodisney experience was that it didnt cater well for children   yes children!!! I went with my grandaughter for her first holiday abroad ashe is 2 &1 2, her parents and jmy friend. We stayed at the Newport Bay Club which was lovely to look at. It was overcrowded and HOT   no airconditioning working made us feel hot and irratable. There was no small children activities like a play area but they do say that thre is in the hotel. When we asked where the area was they said just sit in the bar and gave us 4 crayons.?? There was only one 4 person passener lift to the dining area and around 100 people in a queue waiting to use the lift. The food was very expensive nothing really below 20euros for anything near decent. The europeans are rude   very rude men especially. The staff or crew there were mostly rude and not customer focussed. We booked our stay as a family over 6 months ago buton ceck in our rooms were floors apart. After creating a scene by them telling us they were fully booked they found 2 rooms ajoining miraculousley out of thin air as we had booked. It would have saved time just to allocate them as requested on arrival.Everything was on a poorer scale to USA the parks were overcrowded and there was litlle shade or seating to cope with such crowds. Few people could understand english so were not able to assist properly. To wait for csomething to eat was a bind when they said the waiting time is up to 2 hours which is appaling by any standards. We went later to the parks to keep out of the heat and also to hopefully find it quieter but by 7pm on Sunday it was closed. The park was winding down and all eateries were shut by 5pm.Disney village was tired in its appearance even Rainforest Cafe looked very tired and plastic just not what you would expect after paying high prices for poor servce and appearance. The Disney products are better in USA and in UK the shops stocked nothing new and looked old fashioned.I was greatly disappointed but i did keep comparing it to Florida. There was no comparison. The worst bit about it was that it is in France   where they are rude, obnoxious and French !!!!",-1
"If you have already been to Anaheim and Orlando you will find HK Disneyland sadly lacking. Space Mountain, Buzz Lightyear, Small World and Jungle Cruise as well as a bunch of the smaller rides like teacups, Carousel, Winnie the Poo etc. Notably missing are most of the good rides like Splash, Big Thunder, Pirates, Indiana, Haunted Mansion etc. However, we still had an enjoyable day. As always everything is clean and the staff are friendly and helpful, however, the food outlets are awful, when we were there the Comet had 4 meals on offer, but could only supply 1 of them and the alternate restaurant that we found opposite had burger style meals that were not nice, the pork in my friends burger was stringy and dehydrated. ",-1
"If disney was going to do this then they should have done it properly.Too small,not enough rides and queues for everything.Ocean park for me every time",-1
"My partner recently stayed with you, as a teacher on a school trip. He spoke highly of your service, and the attractions. Whilst his stay he bought me a mikey and minnie photo frame as a gift to bring home. Though when he got it home, I discovered the shocking quality of this product. The material was peeling of the back and stand, the paint work looks like it's been done by a toddler with a crayon, and the general quality of the product is just disgraceful.I would advise in future you review the quality of the products for sale in your resort shops, to avoid further disappointment. Your shabby photo frame ruined what was supposed to be a romantic gesture. Well done disney. ",-1
"Went to Disneyland Paris, 4 8 September. All I can say is that whatever price you have budgeted for this holiday, treble it at least and that is how much money you are likely to spend.My advice is save up and go to Florida. The food and drink are way over priced, all the fast food is the same. The Queues are ridiculous, 30 minutes every time you want to buy a drink, 2.59 euros for a small cup of tea.The staff have no idea of what customer service is, for example at Casey's Corner, I wanted 5 teas, Queued for ages to be told they had no milk but I could have hot milk in my tea and then was told I would have to pay for the hot milk on top of the 2.59 for the tea, what a joke, I told them to shove it.The Americans fall over themselves backwards to help,the Disney staff need to get some serious tips on customer service. 95% don't crack a smile and couldn't care less if you enjoy your day or not, as long as you are paying the money that's all they seem bothered about.The Queues for rides are terrible, especially weekends, 120 minutes for the main rides, half the time the fast passes were not working. Every day at least one of the main rides wasn't working.Than goodness we had been there for two days before else would have only managed 3 rides in the day.They let far too many people in for the size of the park and the amount of staff they employ.The pushing in, has to be seen to be believed. The Europeans have no manners at all, I can't believe I had forgotten this fact.Was in one Queue and up to 20 people pushed in before we got to the ride, my daughter spoke to one Spanish family and asked them to go to the back of the queue, only for the father to shout shut up in my daughter's face. Very intimidating and very rude.The staff ignore all the pushing and shoving in the queues, they have no queue management at all.I gave the park two stars for the park itself and the late night show and even that was a bun fight at night. People shoving and pushing to get a position to see the castle. On the Saturday night, a bunch of French teens were throwing their rubbish at an English couple standing at the front and kept shouting out are you English and even though French staff were standing around the edge, they did nothing. This was the same every evening, as every night there were nearly fights amongst the crowd but staff always turned a blind eye.Six of us went to Disneyland Paris and none of us will go back. Give me Florida any day and in the end, the food, drink, and merchandise is so much cheaper.",-1
We thought for $100 each entry we would get to ride all attractions...a couple of rides were closed and a couple broke down during the day...the main strip has maintenance work going on which means no paradesWe hardly saw any characters The lines for rides were huge...too many people and too many strollers and this is quiet season!Food and merchandise is way over priced..almost $5 for a coke that would buy outside for a dollar..i felt ripped off more so than being in the happiest place on earth,-1
"It has been said that Disney makes enough in revenue to be able to entirely rebuild the park every 3 days, yet nothing has been added in decades (apart from more overcrowding). It is wall to wall packed right from the start of the day, this only becomes entirely ridiculous once staff begin roping off 2 3's of the walk ways to cater to the numerous parades (why not buy some more land & dedicate a stadium to host parades as most people end up lining up for hours before these parades even begin then end up not being able to even see them as the crowds are so thick). The lines for most rides were over an hour for what ends up being 2 minutes or less of an outdated toddlers ride, i do not know how small children can wait for so long all day in the sun. Prams run you down at every turn & even the queue for lunch took over 40 minutes. No more characters in the park either, you have to queue to meet them (we had a 5yr old so had to meet Elsa & Anna which was an hours wait for a quick hello & a photo). If you add up how much you end up paying per ride it is well over $25 a ride (as the crowds prevent anyone being able to do more than 4 5 short rides the entire day), Just awful, we ended up walking around all day trying to find a queue that was less than a 40 minutes wait before giving up & leaving, never want to go back there again. Universal is far & beyond better in every respect.",-1
"I've brought my family to Disneyland and Disney world many times over the years. This time we stayed at the disneyland Californian grand adventure hotel which I do recommend. Staying on property gives you the amenity of early admission which is awesome! Also this particular hotel has an entrance for California adventure which comes in handy. However, the park itself was disappointing. It seriously appeared to be oversold as I can't imagine it was within the safe capacity. The main thoroughways were shoulder to shoulder continuously after about noon each day we were there. The entire crowd moved at an extremely slow pace, frustrating everyone. To make matters worse they began blocking off the main thoroughways at about 7pm for the parades, light shows, and fireworks. This made movement of the crowds near impossible. Forget trying to get to any of the destinations you were planning to get to. At the same time they close down 2 full sections of the park, toontown and fantasyland. This shoves even more people into less space. And to brighten your evening the cast members are there to continuously tell you to  keep moving  when the the entire crowd in front of you is standing still and there is literally no possible way anyone can move. Another odd change is that, there are long line areas where they used to have the lines but now they keep the guests waiting outside in the heat and let a few in at a time to make the long walk in the air conditioning where people standing outside could be (and used to be). I understand that a day at Disney with crying children causes high stress, but there's been a change since my last visit to Disneyland as the tension seems to start with the tone of the cast members. ",-1
"Well What a difference to the last time, First attraction broke down, then went to the making of movies set and the tractor or train broke down and yes you are right then the set broke down,Waste of moneyThe food is well over priced and it is dank.The whole place is DIRTY and in a very poor state of repair.POOR MANS FLORIDA, OH YES THE QUE IS JUST AS LONG AND THE TOILETS STINK",-1
"I visited Disneyland Paris with my family (teenage daughter and 9 year old son) on a stopover visit to Paris last week. I experienced the worst day out at an establishment that is run by people who obviously do not understand the brand they are trying to sell; and that's what it is   a sales trick. At Disneyland Paris I found some (mostly malfunctioning) adventure rides positioned as an enticement to the biggest retail space in Paris. Disneyland Paris is not about fun rides, it's about spending your currency in Disney outlets. The rides don't work   we arrived at a ridiculously crowded park last week and spent the whole day there (10am   11.45pm). Having paid over   200 for tickets to gain admission we queued for 6 different rides during the day; four of which either broke down before we could get on them or broke down while we were on and had to be evacuated. My 9 year old son was evacuated from two of his favourite Disney 'story' rides through backstage areas featuring trash bins and service vehicles   in his words  the magic died  that day and so did my interest in anything to do with Disney. The irony of it all was that while we were sat on broken down rides the PA speakers were pumping out messages about the Disney magical fantasy experience spanning 20 years! The only highlight of the day was the Buffalo Bill Wild West show which I took the .children to in the evening to make up for a ruined day out   costing me another   200 for the show but at least it was worth it   well run and friendly service, good food and some great cowboy action. An enjoyable fantasy.So in conclusion buyer beware; if you want fun adventure rides that work and represent value for the money you pay to get in   then stay well away from Disneyland Paris or run the risk of experiencing a day like ours. Go to a fun rides park instead.",-1
"My husband and I went to DL with another couple. Both my husband and I have been to DW many times. We were surprised at the un Disney like atmosphere of these parks. We are not Disney experts by any means but working in the corporate world, quite familiar with the Disney way. The Disney way is absent at this park.The first thing we noticed is that the park was dirty. It is rare to see a full trashcan or any paper on the ground at DW. Not so at DL. DL had overflowing trash cans all throughout the day. The bathrooms were appalling. I understand that they are used continuously throughout the day but these weer just nasty. A number of the waiting areas for the rides had dirt ground in the walls and trim as well as paint ripped off the walls. The place is just trashed.There is a lack of characters at the park. We weren't there to see them as we had no small children but it felt like any other theme park because there wasn't any Disney characters. The cast members were not friendly or helpful. The park lacks maps and signs so we had to ask directions a few times and no one was friendly or helpful. In addition, the cast members were readily visible eating lunch, ordering lunch and arriving to and from work. The lines to get on anything were ridiculous. It seems as if the park needs to cap admission at some point. Three hour waits? No thank you. The Fast Pass is a joke. You can only get one every two hours. We arrived shortly after 9 AM and the Fast Passes for the  good  rides were already in the early evening. Also, on the Grizzly River Run, we had to wait in line and then had to wait in line while on the ride three times. WTF??? They were filling too many boats and it caused a backlog that resulted in a poor ride experience.Honestly, there is nothing special about this park. It feels like any other generic theme park except the rides are really tame. It's like Six Flags with Disney merchandise.",-1
"I cannot believe how much money we paid for tickets and what we were able to do in the park due to the crowds.....unbelievable! We visited the park in the early 80's when our children were young and wanted our grandchildren to experience it now. Not even close to the fun we had back then. Long, long lines for everything! And the cost for food, merchandise and even a bottle of water was ridiculous! The park is still really clean and it has lots to see and do but you are very limited to what you'll experience due to the huge amount of people wanting to experience the same thing. If you have the luxury to go during the winter on a weekday, I think you'll have better luck getting your moneys worth than we did.",-1
"I was expecting it will be the happiest place on earth LOL. Went to the park at 8 am and there you go the line up to the entrance was crazy. You have to line up for the security thing. They will check your stuffs    MANUALLY   . They dont have a scanner or XRAY machine. It took forever. And wasnt sure if they will detect something by just checking those stuffs manually. Then you will pass another security. They took my go pro stick and i was so sad. I literally cried goodthing i have sunglasses on me. They said its their new policy. Whatever ! Then when we were on our way to the park , it was already crowded and i havent seen a crowd like that ever. LOL. It is very a huge park. It was so hot as well. Their prices inside the park for food and everything are so ridiculous. You have to line up for everything. For washroom, rides, foods. Everything! Well, i just wanna try how it feels to be in there. Took a lot of pictures. They have some photographers in some area and they will take picture of you behind those castles and spots then if you have a maxpass you can download the pictures online. So better get a maxpass. We tried some rides. My boyfriend loves them. Then ended up getting sick after some few rides. So we have to go back to our hotel earlier. We were planning to wait for the fireworks. It was fine with me then since it wasnt really my thing. I really hate the crowd. And hate walking that much under the heat of the sun.",-1
I dream of coming to Disneyland since I was little. I never had a chance until now and it was way too pricey and way too crowded. I even got the fast past but it's still at least 1 hour wait for certain attractions. I think my dream died a little because it's not as magical for adults!! LOL ,-1
"If you like, spending money like water, feeling ripped off, eating hotdogs (and I usually like junk food but not these!) standing in the blazing Sun for an hour for a two minute ride, having verbal exchanges with Dutch people cutting the queue, constantly watching your kids, looking at the miserable faces of everyone there, waiting in a football like crowd for an hour to get a McDonalds, being treated rudely by most of the staff, using dirty fish smelling toilets (in the actual Disney park) and paying 12Euros for face painting per child. You will love it. I didn't.",-1
I have just returned from Disneyland Paris and am hugely dissappointed. All of the staff are French and obviously means the service you recieve is poor. They come across rude and not bothered. Everyone smokes in the park so you leave smelling of smoke which cant be good for the children. They even light up in queues for rides so you cant even breath. Some of the rides are soo old and run down you can see the rust. Especially rides like Star Tours and Armaggedon should be closed down as they look like something out of the 90's. The Disney Village is just as bad Planet Hollywood is nothing compared to the London version. Rude waiters and old run down interior. Mcdonalds meals had more taste than Planet Hollywood. I was dissappointed at the overall experience. The queues were crazy and the security at the entrance was a joke. You could easily bypass the bag search by walking around the side and at some times they had no bag search at all. French people have no clue of how to queue and rather than stand in a line at rides and at the entrance they prefer to gather around and push through. The only positive was Val D'Europe the shopping centre near by. Had quite a few shops and resturants which we enjoyed. I would reccomend Disneyland Orlando if you want the real experience. The French have completley lost the idea of Disney.,-1
Visited this place with little children.  Very disappointing that most of the rides and attractions were blocked or closed for renovation.  I was not told that when i booked the tickets online.,-1
"This is our 3rd Disney Park and my god was we disappointed. I can honestly see how in 2016 they made 2.4 billion in profits from there parks. They sell happiness but do they sell it at a reasonable price. God no 1 single banana $2.99plus tax, small bottle of water $3.29 plus tax. Walling round this park looking a the 1 to 2 hour plus lines i thought to myself why am I here. Is it for the top rides in the world... No is it for the amazing treatment from there cast... No I actually couldn't give myself a good enough reason. There food is mediocre for a high price. There rides are not the best in the industry. There is no real value in a Disney park..... Save some money and take the kids to parks that's Invest because they want you to be happy and enjoy not just because they want to rinse you for supply the so called happiest place on earth. ",-1
"If you go to Disneyland DO NOT ever go the day after Christmas or New Years Eve. Everyplace I have ever been has a maximum limit on admissions (not to say I'm special, I bought my tickets on line well in advance) but it seems that D Land thinks it is exempt   pack 'em in and make some bucks! If someone were to yell fire on New Years Eve the stampede would have been uncontrollable and surely someone and or children could have been trampled to death! With the cost of the tickets and how expensive everything in the park is I think we should all go to a different theme park   Sorry Disneyland but I think your time is done with and I will not ever go back.....(by the way   the fireworks on the day after Christmas had to be canceled because of the crowds   crowd vs. fire hazard, way to go Disney...)",-1
"I' ve visited HK Disneyland with my family (children 7 & 13) in a not so busy day. The kids covered the attractions in 3 hours, including repeated visits to few of them. They were both very disappointed; the number and size and quality of the attractions was very poor comparing to expectation. It seems to me like this Disneyland is made a trap for Chinese who have less experience to disney world in general and consequently are easier satisfied. I have no opinion on food as we didn't have lunch since the kids wanted to leave the place immediately.As one could expect, i found it very expensive for what it offered to my family. Visited April 2014",-1
Overcrowded. people take cuts in long lines and seem to be plain rude. Moms with strollers are dangerous.,-1
Very Different to the N American Disney Parks. Not in a good way. The staff are not as friendly and the park is much smaller and the european attitude and Disney attitude do not mix very well. I was really disappointed with this park as I have been to the US ones and Japan so was expecting more.,-1
"Not very well organised. Hard to find the restrooms. Hard to find bubblers. Very very expensive. Very disappointed, probably because we went to Universal Studios first and they were great! It is nice to go to Disney once but since it is our 4th time we are done.",-1
I am surprised the management at Disneyland have not incorporated the latest in line and crowd control. It is hard to wait for 40 minutes in a line with a child. Makes the experience tortuous and you will stand there telling your child to be patient and vowing never to return to Disneyland. It is worth a transatlantic ticket to go to the parks in America that have better roller coasters rides and less line wait times. Hellish experience. We have vowed to never go back.,-1
I have been to Disney World in Florida once and Disneyland in Californis numerous times. Both are world class entertainment facilities for young and old alike. Hong Kong`s version is a bad joke and a total rip off. Save your money. For this style of entertainment go to Ocean Park on Hong Kong Island. It is light years better.,-1
"I had purchased 4 tickets online for my family the morning before heading out to the park paying 181 euros for the tickets. When We got there we were refused entry as in the fine print it said that the tickets were only valid as of the day after purchase. We went to customer service and were told that there was no way that they would accept the tickets that day but we could write to the online customer service and they would refund us.They made no mention of any condition to this refund. We decided not to buy tickets at the gate as it would have cost us nearly 300 euros over and above the 181 already spend and the joyous mood had been killed by the bad news.It also ruined my son's birthday which was the occasion for our visit.I wrote them the same day. No response until 10 days later when they asked me for proof of purchase which i provided. I didn t hear anything to my reply nor my 4 follow up emails until 3 weeks later where they asked me to provide them with proof of purchase of gate tickets as well before they consider  a financial gesture . I answered that email and nearly 2 weeks later I have no refund nor any response.We are disgusted that we have been ripped off, they ignore our messages and that they have not kept their word to refund us.",-1
"Before entering the park we were greeted by French armed forces and police which although made you feel safe also didn   t since there was a random amount of beggars and illegal sellers of counterfeit souvenirs along with people trying to get you to give them your Disney tickets to get in (this happened a couple of times when entering and leaving). Once past security you have to walk through the Disneyland hotel which as it was raining the floor was extremely slippy and unsafe dangerous, we saw no signs telling people to be careful due to the floors and even saw someone fall and hurt themselves as a result of the water.Once up to the main entrance people were trying to use rfid cards that don   t work very well (not like Florida which has magic bands which we have never had problems with). Inside the park felt dated and disappointing and felt like an extremely cheap version of a Disney location. The queues for rides was very long and when you did get there the cast members we unhelpful, ignorant and arrogant. We paid extra to go to the Halloween 2018 event and found it disappointing, once in we were forced down a path and away from Main Street until we got to an open area which had no lights and signs so became quite lost as allot of areas were closed off at this time. We tried to walk to get to some rides and ended up walking round in circles round structures like Hyperspace mountain because of the no lights situation and lack of signs. In all the event and even normal days just felt unorganised with cast members looking at you in disgust and never smiling or being helpful. We had purchased the photo pass as part of our package however only saw a couple of character points and no photographers around, at other parks in the USA there are photographers everywhere taking pictures in notable areas that would make good memory pictures in Disneyland Paris you get none of this and it just felt like a waste of the additional    69.99. We were soo disappointed and won   t be going back to Disneyland Paris after the ignorant, arrogant and downright rude staff, it felt like you were putting them out by asking to purchase food, souvenirs or by trying to go on a ride. It felt unorganised and you didn   t know what to do or where to go most of the time. Through all our time here we just felt like we were putting them out by being in Disneyland Paris, I couldn   t tell people to ever go as it was just disappointing and we came away feeling like we had wasted a huge amount of money.",-1
"I visited this park in 2014 and had a great time. In March 2017, I had a miserable day at this park. The place was packed with people. Waited in line at restrooms for over twenty minutes in the area by the Peter Pan ride. Food lines were insane probably 45 minutes. We had park hopper passes, so we went over to the studios side late in the afternoon to hopefully find some food lines that weren't so long. We were unsuccessful and they were shutting down some of the restaurants for the day. We eventually found an indoor restaurant near the Buzz Light Year ride that had shorter lines. I think I rode 4 rides all day long. Wait times were way too long and we were only able to get a few of the reserved time passes. We did go to a few shows including the finale, which is the best thing in the park. My experience in the 2014 was totally different. We rode almost every ride in the park and had no problem finding food or using the restrooms quickly. It seems they didn't have enough staff the second time around. I will not return. It seems like Disney is not concerned about their guests' experiences.",-1
"If your one of the locals and you think that going to Disneyland on Halloween might be fun......please rethink this. It was so overly crowded that we couldn't move on Main Street. Although the park is incredibly decorated, I'll wait to see it during their off hours in the week from now on. ",-1
"   250 total for tickets, parking and food for two adults, two kids. Very disappointing. Very long queues everywhere, even in February. We joined one queue at the  30 min from this point  sign. One hour later we finally got on the ride, which lasted exactly 1min 20 seconds!Some more rides might be a good idea   there are more shops than there are rides.Very little indoor seating at any of the fast food restaurants   fine in summer but not very comfortable on a cold February day. Staff are unfriendly to the point of being rude. Instructions are barked at you. On more than one of the rides, a member of staff came along and tugged at our seatbelt without saying a word, no  excuse me  or  please may I check you have your seatbelt on . As if we were animals being herded. I didn't see a single member of staff smile the entire day and noticed very few smiles on the faces of the other visitors.Nothing magical about it at all. A complete rip off. We'll definitely not be going back.",-1
"We went 'off peak' before the October holidays began thinking it would be less busy but we were in for a shock. It was so busy it was a nightmare to even get a table to eat, impossible to book anything via our hotel. We never managed to book a carachter meal at all during our stay, but did get to meet Mickey at Buffalo Bills Wild West Show, which was a highlight. 1 hour queues for rides. Rude and stressed staff especiallyin food places, very overpriced. People smoking everywhere. It surprised me how many adult only parties there were queing for the rides meant for the younger kids (slinks ride and Buzz lightyear!!) and pushing in front of the kids to meet carachters.. The kids were struggling to see the parades for the adults barging in front. 75% of people there behaved like animals, it was truly shocking. There were a few magic moments (Disney Dreams) and the look on my kids' faces meeting Cruella De Vill and Maleficent but the crush on the shuttle bus afterwards Dreams was a total health and safety nightmare, an elderly lady was almost trampled under the bus because there were hundreds pushing to get on when the park closed. Unless you are a total Disney nut job, as were the75% of previously mentioned visitors are, I wouldn't recommend this one little bit. Kids loved the few magic moments we had but it but we certainly wont be back to.",-1
"After paying for 3 days at the park and 3 nights In an associated nearby hotel, we left after 1 day. Awful awful.75minute queues for 2 minute rides. Rides were old and rough. Fast pass option hardly worth the effort as you can only have 1 active at a time. We did 3 rides by 3.30pm. Awful. So so disappointing. We skipped the hotel and headed back to paris for an extra few nights . I felt sad for all the families who had saved hard to be there and promised their kids a good time. I did not see anyone smiling all day. ",-1
"i booked a three day package to stay in the Disney New York hotel for two nights, which includes three day park ticket for myself, my husband and two children (10 and 12).I decided to stay in a Disney hotel as the adverts clearly stated that you got access to the parks before the general public and I thought the extra cost would be worth avoiding the queues for at least some of the bigger rides.. BEWARE. Only the Magic Kingdom was opened early (NOT Disney Studios) and non of the large rides are open.. In fact, I was not aware of any of the rides being open, although with children older than toddlers, we did not check the Tea cups or dumbo ride. Truly disappointing!We also had food included and this too was very disappointing. The restaurants seemed ok when we first arrived, but following almost 30 minutes of waiting to be served (even a drink), we soon realised that it would be over an hour before we would eat. I would however say that the ratatouille restaurant was worth a visit, by far the best service and perhaps the better food.. All of the food is mass catered so don't expect much regardless of the restaurant name (I.e planet Hollywood).The hotels are very simple but New York is a great location (it will however take you a minimum of half an hour to check in, and that is with no queue.. No obvious reason why). The whole experience was so poor in the end, we did not bother using our 3rd days ticket. It is such a miserable place, the staff look depressed and even when we wanted to get our photos taken, the photographer on one of the rides was too busy on her phone to bother (unusual for theme park to not try and sell photos)... Everything is dated and just plain miserable, even the Rats!!... Yep, real rats, running around at dusk.. Although the sight of these were perhaps the highlight of this trip for me..as they looked like they were having more fun than anyone working there.. I guess I expected something similar to America.. You certainly can't compare!! This was my third time to this park since it first opened and it has progressively got worse...I will never go back again!! ",-1
"Although we had a great time celebrating my baby granddaughter's 1st birthday on Sunday, January 26, most of us developed the Norovirus this week and were very sick. The baby was the first two days later to start the vomiting, fever, diarrhea and abdominal pain. Next, her mom and grandmother got it two more days later. We had lunch at Caf   Orleans and the baby had the apples and carrot sticks (something else with that menu item, maybe pasta). Anyway, we would like to see the resort do a better job of food safety. I had to go to Urgent Care yesterday to rehydrate with an IV. This is the virus that has affected several cruise ship passengers recently. When I called Disneyland to inform them of the incident, the operator put me through to Guest Experience and no one picked up the call. I will be calling the Health Department also.",-1
"We went with our daughter and family, two grandchildren of 4half and 2. They enjoyed themselves and had a great time. But the adults found the whole experience very dissapointing. There was no magic to the trip for us, the parks looked rundown and tired. There was scafolding round the castle, broken pavements and faded paint on many rides. The food and drink in the parks was ridiculusly expensive,   7 for a pint of beer, nearly   4 for a diet coke in a bar,   12 for burger and chips,   4 for an icecream, etc, etc. The other European guests push and shove their way around the park, have no concept of personal space while queueing, don't bother to queue at all most of the time anyway, not even in the toilets. There are no characters walking around the parks and you have to queue for a meet and greet to get their autographs or a photo taken with them. The characters themselves were mostly lovely when we actually got to the front of the queues and this was the 4 year olds favorite part of the visit. There were big queues on lots of the rides and this was March. We had booked into a Disney hotel in order to make the most of the two hours pre opening but most of the rides were still shut until 10 which made the queues for the only rides open longer than during the rest of the day anyway. We were booked in to the Sequoia Lodge which was just a few minutes walk from the Disney Village. The hotel was clean and the beds were comfortable but they do not even supply tea and coffee making facilites in the rooms. We went to the swimming pool which was a nice size but not very warm. The changing facilities were hopeless with just two changing cubicles in the ladies (none at all in the mens), two toilets and a very small open changing area. They even charge 2 euros for a pool towel. The best thing about it was that the lockers were free. The breakfast buffet was a bit limted and there was nothing hot except toast and there was only one toaster for the whole room full of people (probably 100 or more). There was no variety in the breakfast either, just the same stuff every day. And if you went after7.30am, you had to start your day off with a queue to get in the door.Overall, the children loved it but they didnt know how much better it should have been. The adults found the whole place very disapointing and none of us would ever go there again.",-1
"I recently went to Disney World in Florida for the third time (for my Birthday), and had the most amazing time. I couldn't have imagined a better trip when I left home. This summer (2010), I went to Paris, and didn't PLAN on going to Disneyland Paris, but had a free day, and thought it would be fun. WRONG!It was atrocious! First off, the park has much fewer attractions than in WDW or Disneyland, CA. But that wasn't the bad part. The bad part was atmosphere. It was DIRTY, and most of the fixtures and buildings were in disrepair!For anyone who has been in a US Disney Park, you know that Disney is spotless and amazing. Customer service is their number one goal, and they do an excellent job at it. Well, not here! The park is is total disgrace to the Disney name! And the cast members were unfriendly, and did not go out of their way to make your day magical in the way they do at home.The icing on the cake is that even though smoking is  not permitted  in the park (except for in designated smoking areas, the same as in WDW), people walk around smoking everywhere. In fact, it's hard to find a place to stand where you do NOT smell smoke. It's vile. I asked a cast member why they don't enforce this rule (as they do in WDW), and was told,  If you ask someone to stop smoking, they may punch you.  Nice. So I guess I have to suffer because the staff is afraid of being accosted by cigarette addicted lunatics.",-1
"I was at Disneyland a while back and there are pluses and minuses. On the plus side... if you have kids, they will love it, they have decent rides, their small Disney village is cute and there is beauty all around.On the negative side, it's smaller then I expected, not as many rides as I thought and the queues are very long.",-1
"My husband and I went to Disneyland and Adventure Park to celebrate his college graduation. we are from Indiana, so we flew out to California and visited other places as well, such as Universal Studios and Seaworld  both of which we had a great time. We saved Disneyland for last because we were both excited for it, but boy, were we disappointed! We went to Disneyland on a Monday and it was completely packed. As we entered the park, we saw that the Matterhorn was down for the season. We were disappointed, but we entered the park and headed for Space Mountain. After waiting in line about 20 minutes, the ride shut down and they didn't know how long it was going to take to fix. We decided to move on to the Indiana Jones ride. We walked over there, and found out that it was broken down as well. We had wasted an hour by this point and were becoming frustrated, so we decided to eat at Pizza Port over by Space Mountain. The prices were outrageous! We paid $4 for two breadsticks, and over $7 for one slice of pizza! But the most frustrating thing was that the food wasn't even good. When we go to other amusement parks, such as Kings Island, the food is expensive, but at least it's good. By midafternoon we found some rides that weren't broken down. For dinner we ate at The Golden Horseshoe, and we were once again disappointed by the price and the taste. It was $26 for two small meals and one drink. Wednesday we went to Adventure Park. We went straight over to the big roller coaster, California Screamin', but, it too was broken down. We rode a few other rides and we surprised how small the lines were there. For lunch, I was wanting a pretzel, so we found a pretzel place on the map and headed towards it. When we got over there, it was behind the construction wall, and there wasn't a way to get over to it. We decided to do pizza instead so we found it on the map, went over to it, and once again it was behind the wall. It should not have been on the map if you cannot get over to it. Frustrated and starving by this point, we walked over to the other side of the park to a cafe. I got a sandwich and my husband got a bowl of clam chowder and a cookie, and we split a drink. $28 was our total and again, the food wasn't good, nor was the service. We waited about 40 minutes in line while there was about 12 workers there, 8 of which we standing around not doing anything. They were moving very slow. My bread was hard and it was stale. Not to mention there was not place for us to sit. They had about four restaurants altogether beside each other, and not enough place for everyone to sit and eat. We had to stand there with our tray and wait for someone to get done eating. After we ate, we watched Aladdin, which was probably our favorite thing the whole day. We went to a few gift shops, and we had about $50 worth of souvenirs in our hands. We got behind a couple in line and waited while she checked them out. We waited there about 10 minutes before the cashier told us that there wasn't a separate line for her register and we would have to wait in another line. She was very rude. She let us stand there the whole time while we checked the other people out. We were angry, and left the souvenirs and the park at 4 p.m, way before closing time.  Between Disneyland and Adventure Park we were frustrated with the rides constantly breaking down, expensive but not tasty food, the slow and poor service while getting our food, and the rude cashier. I would not recommend Disneyland to anyone. We felt like both days were a waste of time and money, and we will never go back. It was nothing like I remembered from the last time I had been there. Every other place we went to in California (San Diego Zoo, Universal Studios, Seaworld) I would recommend, but not Disneyland or Adventure Park. Not only was it the most expensive place to get in to, and the most expensive food and parking, but also the most disappointing place we went during our whole vacation.",-1
"Reaching Disneyland Hong Kong was easy through the MTR. Wherever you are in Hong Kong through the MTR you get off at Sunny Bay and then on to the pink line to Disneyland.This Disneyland is very small compared to the ones in Anaheim and Disney World in Orlando (I have never been to those in Tokyo or Paris).I always describe my visit to Disney either in Anaheim or Orlando as a Prozac pill that will last me for a year. So in accordance, believing in the magic of Disney I thought this will apply to Disneyland Hong Kong. I visited the park on the 14th of July 2014 and it was hot, not hotter than Orlando, but for the life of me I do not know why I couldn   t tolerate the heat.The people there were loud, cut lines and had the most undisciplined children ever.The stands that offer ice cream, popcorn or cotton candy also had dried squid that smelled awful. And guess what? People actually bought that dried squid and ate them and fed them to their kids leaving a disgusting smell during waiting lines. We went to Disney Hong Kong as couple, my husband and I, we tried to stay tolerant but after an hour and half in to the park I wanted to leave. I was so looking forward to the fireworks but I got a massive headache from all the loud speaking people there. Either they were hard of hearing or I had sensitive ears. I did not experience the magic of Disney. I need a do over.",-1
"Firstly, most rides for anyone aged 12 and up are closed. We did a 1 day park hopper for both parks and found that enough. If you don't have children with you this park can easily be completed in a couple of hours as most rides are shut. I've been to every Disneyland park and this is by far the worst one. Nearly everything is shut (who refurbishes all the teenage adult rides during peak season?). This Disneyland also lacks the Disney feel that all the other parks have. There is also zero variety in the shopping that can be done and every shop sells the exact same thing.Disney theater shows some awesome Disney short films, worth seeing. Space mountain is a great ride and definitely worth doing. Indiana jones, pirates of the Caribbean and Phantom Manor are shells of their counterparts. For eating the Hakuna Matata restaurant served a nice kebab sandwich, chips, drink and ice cream for    15. Overall, Disneyland Paris right now is a huge ripoff considering the majority of the main attractions are closed. The shopping and variety in the stores is horrendous and the lack of Disney music, characters and atmosphere is just plain sad. It's the first Disney park that I've been disappointed in and the first Disney park that I don't classify as Disney. Save your money and go to Orlando or any other Disney park actually. ",-1
Having had an excellent time in Disney Florida a few years ago we were excited to be spending two days here when visiting California.Very disappointed. We left early and we didn't come back on the second day ... we went to Six Flags Magic Mountain instead.The selection of rides is limited if you are looking for some thrill rides and certainly doesn't offer the same scope and scale as their park in Florida.Service was great as was the ambiance in the park.... just not recommended if you are with teenagers.,-1
"Disneyland Paris looks like a Disneypark   but make no mistake, it itsn't. For a start, most of the rides on our visit was closed   or closed down while we were waiting (for over an hour on several rides). The park looks tired, in dire need of fresh paint and TLC. The staff is not what you'd expect from an expensive, Disney branded park. Most of them lacking language skills or just being rude. In the best case, totally uninterested in your presence. We stayed at the New York hotel, and found the room to be small, with cigarette marks on the furniture, staind carpet and dirty wall paper. Check in staff didn't speak English.. and WiFi is extra. Not what I expect from a 'deluxe hotel'.Avoid the restaurant Parkside. The staff was so uninterested in our business that we (2 adults, 2 children) left without ordering (which nobody noticed)If you can afford it, go to Florida or California. And if you are Disney: Change the management or close the park. I'm sorry to sound so negative, but the highlight of our 2 day visit was McDonalds and the nearby village.",-1
"We have just returned from a weekend break with our 3 children aged 4,11,14 and to say we were disappointed is an understatement . We found the park dirty and it's in need of a magic wand to make things look better. The castle was covered with scaffolding so the bottom half was in all of our photos , toilets are terrible with tissue and water everywhere . We actually had a competition amongst ourselves to find a Disney member of staff with a smile on their face .. We are yet to find one! . We have been to Florida Disney world and staff will come over and have a conversation and ask how you are enjoying your stay, even the retail staff seem to be in character they are always happy and polite . My advice to families would be to save your money and go to Alton towers instead, it's closer to home and a lot cheaper.",-1
"Visited this past weekend and have never left the happiest place on earth so disappointed. If you do not purchase a ticket for the holiday treat you should just not go. Granted it was very hot but when they shut down Disney, the other park gets way to crowded",-1
"Where do I start, filthy, smelly, dirty etc. Food appalling, service pathetic, ignorant and frankly nasty staff. Meal plan, waste of money and time, 2 hour queue just for food, horrible cold food with a pathetic choice. Bus to park, well get to the    queue    last and you will get on the bus, no such thing as a queue you need to learn to PUSH even over kids and disabled NEVER seen anything like this DUMP. This is NOT Disney. Pathetically run franchise.",-1
"We visited Disneyland today, my wife, myself and my 3 year old son attended.I don't know where the park managers get the idea that they can safely pack the number of people in to the park that they do and have any degree of safety.The management obviously has not a care for their patrons' fun or enjoyment either. The wait for anything was at minimum an hour to ninety minutes with SO many more people than the park was ever designed to deal with..The place was obviously designed for maybe 20% of the number of people who they actually let in.It seems that the only thing the park wants is money, nothing else.The Parking was exceptionally expensive, the tickets were exceptionally expensive, and what did we get for it? There were no employees on the grounds, except ones selling things or palpably miserable overworked minimum wage teenagers running the rides.We left in disgust after 2 and a half hours of misery, nothing could salvage ANY part of the experience. It was literally the worst time I have ever had at a park like this, and there was nothing special going on, IT'S ALWAYS this bad!Save your money and your time, go elsewhere, Universal City Walk is much much nicer, less crowded, cost less and was more modern. They could not pay me to go back here.",-1
"The newest and most popular ride, Cars, broke down 30 minutes after opening at 8am and did not come back up until 730pm.  This is a real disappointment to kids, especially if they can't wait over 8 hours for a ride to be fixed.",-1
"We planned our magical disney vacation with our 3 grandchildren 8,6, and 3 years 9 months ago. We chose to go the beginning of May as spring break was over, school still in session and we wanted less crowds. We were giddy with excitement when that time came but alas, it was not to be. Upon entering the park a small sign informed us that 7 of the attractions would not be working during the three days we were there, 5 of them were major! They had to get them in ship shape condition for the summer crowds...really, 7 rides at once? We paid just as much as someone visiting in the summer but received far less. Probably the worst thing was the  Magic Morning . We anticipated no lines for one hour before the park opened to the general public. Well, everyone else had magic morning passes too it seemed and to our horror, all early morning customers were funneled into Fantasy Land as the rest of the park was closed. The crowds were crushing! We stood in line 40 minutes for Peter Pan, but when it was almost our turn they suddenly shut the ride down due to technical difficulties! Our  magic morning  turned into a  miserable morning . We then went to adventure land and waited for 15 minutes for them to open the gates so we could be first in line to ride Big Thunder Mountain, then we dashed over only to find it was closed due to technical difficulties! This went on and on all day long and we only rode 5 rides and we were there from 8:30 am till 8:00 at night! The whole day was a joke, so disappointing. We expected the joy and magic we felt as children, and when we took our own young children. I can't believe Disney treated us as they did, we felt scammed and ripped off and next time we want to bond and enjoy our grandchildren in a magical place we will rent a beach house. We never want to go back!",-1
"Just returned from a 5 day visit to Disney... Went with 3 children , 10,11,13 . We were all very hyped about going but from the moment we entered it was a disappointment . The park in general looks really tired and in desperate need of a lick of paint. We were expecting to see characters around the park , but the characters that you do see comes at the price of a hour   queue . For the price you pay I would expect to see characters walking around the park throughout the day interacting with the customers . In addition to this I wasn't impressed with the lack of more recent Disney character related things around the ark ... Frozen being one of the most recent famous films yet there was no reference to this in the park really ( apart from the parade ) . It was all very old school which was great for the adults but not so relevant for the younger children . There was only one point I was overwhelmed and that was the fireworks , but this is at 11pm which meant we had 3 very tired children who struggled to keep their eyes open and wanted to go back to the hotel room . Plentry of places to buy food around the park but high priced and nowhere near enough seating. Also , prepare yourself to be pushed and shoved , the queuing system here is ridiculas. This is the only place I've known to be near the front of the queue For a hour then someone near the back comes through and gets on first because they've shoved their way through , the Disney staff saw this on lots of occasions and did nothing about it . I witnessed arguments daily because of people pushing through So n a nutshell m wouldn't rush back . If I did it would be in a few years in the hope that it's being updated ....",-1
"Such a bad experience. 90% were mainland china tourist, lots a pushing a shoving, queue jumping in shop, stall, rides and even toilets. The mainland folks have no concept of queuing. Place was dirty, chicken bone everywhere. Staff unhelpfull, no corwd control, no visible security.They should have build this up in China.I recommend you skip HK and go to Japans Tokyo Dinsey Resort.",-1
"My family are all huge fans of Disney. We've been to WDW resorts, watch the films, and have come to expect quite a lot from the brand when it comes to quality. While my children and I had a good time, it was almost in spite of the cast members and the overall upkeep of the Disneyland Paris park.I can't fault the park itself for long queues. I can, however, fault them for dingy rides that desperately need a fresh coat of paint. The entirety of Frontier Land reeked of garbage water. Cast members wandered about in packs, chatting amongst themselves totally disinterested in the guests (which would get them fired in WDW). Trash wasn't picked up, fountains were dirty, and the whole park had an overall  tired  feel to it.One of the daily parades broke down (I know, things happen) and it took nearly an hour to get it back up and running again. That's ridiculous. I know I keep making comparisons to WDW, but it cannot be helped. WDW would have had things up and running in minutes. It just seems that Disneyland Paris really doesn't care about creating a magical atmosphere. Disney Paris is just another amusement park that happens to have Mickey Mouse.With that said, it *is* still Disney. My children had a marvelous time, we met plenty of characters (MAKE RESERVATIONS and DOUBLE CHECK), and most of the rides were up and running when we were there. Cast members, for the most part, were polite. There was plenty to do and the children were absolutely charmed by the scenery, topiaries, characters, rides, and parades. Their joy was enough to keep me motivated for the duration of our trip.",-1
"Very disappointed in the crowds. I expected to wait in lines but the chaos of just trying to walk in the park was unreal. Disney really needs to figure out a way to control how many people enter the park. When families travel a long distance and pay thousands of dollars for a vacation it is frustrating to have so many local season pass holders making lines excruciatingly long and walking from point A to B difficult. Good solution would be to limit the amount of locals allowed in the park per day so that people who are paying full price plus the cost of travel can have an enjoyable vacation.Next problem was the rides breaking down very frequently. No customer service to make it right for people who were significantly inconvenienced by waiting in lines for 1 2 hours just to be sent away. Way too many rides were broken down for very long durations. I get that things break but 5 years ago when we were at Disneyland this problem didn't occur.Thirdly there is no magic. Difficult to see the characters and they just leave little kids (and big kids) standing in line, disappointed and sad because they didn't get to see the character. There needs to be more characters out in the park making guests smile and interacting because that is why people go to Disneyland, for the  magic and happiness . Disneyland is far from being the happiest place on earth.Fourth it is annoying when people pay thousands to get there and stay in a hotel have to pay full price for everything and locals who already have less expense get discounts. Why not lower the prices for everyone? A pen that should cost at most $0.50 is $10.00.Fifth you pay for a full day pass but the park closes early and there is no compensation for it. Pathetic. Lastly, the staff in general was neither friendly or rude with the exception of a few. They didn't seem to care whether guests were happy but they just did the minimal amount to complete their jobs so they wouldn't get fired. Overall, be prepared for uncomfortably long waits for 30 seconds of most likely mediocre experience, extremely high prices for everything, dirty crowded bathrooms, packed walkways, long food lines, poor seating, rides and shows that break down frequently, and staff that mostly doesn't care that you spent a lot of money to go to the  happiest place on earth .",-1
"We were quite disappointed with our Disneyland Paris experience I'm sad to say.Having been lucky enough to travel to the original. Disneyland in California on two occasions, we had admittedly set the bar quite high.But our soured experience didn't come from the rides or food in the park. But rather the express service.Paying extra on your ticket offers the bus service from Paris to the park. You're explicitly told to arrive 15min early for collection. Indeed when dropped at the park, your instructed to arrive back 15min early to avoid missing the bus home.The bus there was late, the bus home was late. Whole not greatly, the effect was near on a dozen persons being there on time as instructed, waiting in the cold for bus that they doubted would show.The support contact phone number, doesn't operate during the weekend hours you're picked up. Not overly reassuring.Sadly this express experience really soured our whole park trip. To the point we most certainly wouldn't recommend it to others.Staff at the park were friendly and professional. The food was delicious. The rides were mirror copies of the ones in the states.",-1
"Had a 2 day hopper pass 1 park per day.Also had the max pass which I think was about $10 per person.As there were so many people found it hard to use this pass as the rides seemed to be booked out and the app would only let you book 1 ride an hour.The 1 main ride we did book ,which was for early evening broke down and we couldn't ride it.Got there at about 10am and left at 9pm and only managed to get on 4 rides.My tips for going to Disney would be get there early and make sure you have everything well organised or it will be a waste of money like it was for us.The crowds here are unbelievable.",-1
"We visited 31 03 to 4 04 with a 3 and 4 year old. We booked the trip over a year ago and were really excited about experiencing the Disney    magic   . However, the reality fell far short for reasons that could have been avoided.On our first day, a cast member shouted so rudely and aggressively at us for several minutes (as we   d walked the wrong way due to poor signage) that our 4 year old was reduced to tears. How any adult would behave in that manner around children is beyond me. The fact it happened at Disney a supposedly child friendly resort was astounding. When I tried to calmly explain our mistake and asked where to go he continued to verbally abuse us until another cast member came, spoke to him sharply in French, and helped us. Even after our return our daughter talks about the    nasty man on the train   , so shame on you Florian, you don   t deserve to work near children.The rides we went on were good, there were queues but that is to be expected. I did notice some of the larger rides were closed which would have been disappointing if our children had been older. Other guests we spoke to who had been before also said they were surprised by the amount of closures on the park.Whilst on the subject of queues, we queued to see Rapunzel. This took nearly 3 hours which is ridiculous and to me typified all that is wrong with DLP. We had two character dining experiences which couldn   t have been more different. Caf   Mickey, very basic food and poor service. It took nearly 2 hours to get a burger, when we complained we were told that the kitchen had messed up. I am glad that we did this though as otherwise we would only have seen the characters on parade and not met them. I was expecting to see them walking around the park but that didn   t happen. They spent time to get photos autographs at each table and given the queues to do this on the Park, it makes it worthwhile. So, I would recommend it but be prepared for a long wait. We went to the Auberge de Cendrillon for our daughter   s birthday and this meal was what made our stay. The staff, notably Salve our waiter, were brilliant. They were happy, conversational, helpful and professional just what you would expect from Disney but until then we hadn   t seen. Similarly, the princesses were great, Belle made our daughter   s day by singing happy birthday, even though she leaving to get ready for the parade. Snow White   s Prince Charming was also especially good with our young girls. Expensive but well worth it, given that we   d tried and failed twice to book at the Princess Pavillion.The evening parade was really good and had the Disney    feel    and it was only place where Frozen was represented. We were really disappointed by this, given the fact that most little girls adore Anna and Elsa. DLP must be the only place in the world where there is no Frozen frenzy! With a few tweaks, out of date attractions like Alice in Wonderland could be changed to represent the interests of this generation.So, overall the test of any theme park is would you return? In honesty, I   m not sure we will.",-1
Do not use Viator skip the line ticket purchase. The people at Disney do not know what to do. It took me 30 minutes in Guest Relations to get a hard ticket. I could have purchased a ticket and been inside in under five minutes. Save your money. This is a 0. ,-1
"Having last visited Disneyland Paris in 1999, we decided to re visit with our now grown up children. The park was really disappointing   overcrowded, with several rides closed and a distinct lack of characters walking about, The shops are so overpriced and really, it is just a huge money making experience. Glad we went back, but I wouldn   t waste money like this again.",-1
"I went to Disney Paris when I was 5. Fifteen years later my innocent view of what a Disney Park looks like was ruined. We were a family of 5, my father, mother, teenage sister and 10 year old brother and I. First off, we had rented a car and the great thing was we could pay 15 Euros for parking at the venue for the entire day. However, as we walk towards the Disney attractions we find Army men with large guns and unpleasant faces patrolling the area about 100 meters away from the gates which allow you to go into the Disney Village. I understand that safety is the utmost importance in a place where millions of people gather, however, this park is for children, you're not meant to scare anyone. People are supposed to feel safe, not threatened. They should find a solution to their Army men located in prime areas maybe in a colorful fortress where children might not be frightened by the scene. As we walked into the village, the place seemed beautiful. People laughing, kids running and a wide selection of well known restaurants. We were instantly attracted to eating at Planet Hollywood, having tried it in London and Orlando we were enthusiastic to try it in France too. It was horrible. The lady at the service area was grumpy and pissed off, the food was not anything Planet Hollywood should be proud to sell and the tables were dirty. Everything was so cramped up in the center and it was all an unpleasant experience. After our meal, we decided we to check out the IMAX cinema which featured all the latest movies. My younger brother was so keen on watching 'Lone Ranger' we decided to go. Now to attract more people the French must understand that they must swallow their pride! Every movie was showing in French! I thought it was obnoxious, especially since they need tourists to like what they offer because of the depressed economic situation in France. I've realized that if we didn't know a few words in French they dealt with their customers poorly. It made me wonder what kind of customer service philosophy they have. I've traveled all over the world, and they've made it clear that they're talking to us because they have to if they want to make any business. The queues were outstanding, 75 to 90 minutes of waiting on rides that last about 30 seconds. They lack in organization skills; a place where the most organization is needed. If Disney Paris don't get their act together they could be losing so many more people in the years to follow. All in all, the thing that really discomforted me and really made me regret the experience was the lack of respect the people working their had for their customers. It was absolutely unbelievable. The people in the rides speak with a tone of frustration, the people at counters are absolutely cold and the whole atmosphere is just dull. There were a few moments when we went into the Studios park and the Attraction park where we found happy people to serve us but that was a rarity; and we had bought 3 day tickets so that was a bummer. Definitely the worst Disneyland experience ever!",-1
"We visited here with our young son in between Christmas and New Year and I can say it was the most disappointing experience of my son's young life. 80 minute queue to meet Mickey Mouse?!?! Shortest ride queue of 70 minutes! Some rides had queues of over 130 minutes. We where told to pay for a  fast pass ... Having spent   150 on tickets, I would think we had paid enough. We got on one ride, saw one small parade and we left as you could not get any food without a horrific queue. I visited here back in 1997 and it is seriously in need of vast improvement. Characters should walk about the park. You should NOT have to queue to see Mickey Mouse. Do not waste your money coming here!! Save up and go to America. I can only say that I was glad we were based in central Paris and not at Disney itself as I would of gone mad!!! When a 5 year old asks to leave Disney Land as he is bored of queuing, you know it's a terrible experience. We visited nearly two months ago and even now I am so disappointed that my son had his dreams dashed by the greed of Disney! Over sold, over busy!! Do not go!!",-1
"Not recommended. Go to Universal Studios. The park is small and crowded no matter when you go. I went on a Tuesday in low season and it was still crowded, you have to make a line even to go to the restrooms. Way smaller than the ones in Orlando. The park is made more for locals than tourists, when in Florida is the other way around.Don  t waste your time.",-1
"Over priced, overly busy, too few attractions, expensive food and drinks and just generally not worth the effort and attendance compared to alternative parks in Hong Kong!!",-1
"It is obvious that the owners of Disneyland are not spending any money on this park. Buildings are looking a little worn, and need to be painted. 4 rides were broken down while we were there. At $96 person, I do not expect there to be any broken rides! Also, 2 vendors were too busy arguing with each other to notice we were in line for service. Terrible experience!! I will not be back!!",-1
"Ok, first of all, if you think paying 60 Euros for visiting both the parks in one day is a good buy, you are wrong. You can hardly cover 15 % of each park in one day. Go there and get a ticket for at least 2 days for one park, or 3 days for both the parks. Its best if you take your own lunch, as restaurants are very crowded, and you ended having a meal in your hand but no place to sit and eat. And the meal is not cheap mind you ! Waiting times for the Roller Coasters are around 70 to 90 Minutes, and during my visit, two of them had stopped functioning for some time, a big disappointment. If you have kids, even worse, as all kids' rides have even longer waiting times, so prepare to buy a 2 or 3 day ticket, or just let the kids enjoy as you stare at them and yourself do nothing. The rides are good, but you dont have time to try all of them, as I said, 10 to 15 % maximum.Take an umbrella with you ! It rains a lot, although only in drizzles.",-1
"It is not the 60 or 70 Euro per person that it costs, even though it doens'tcome for free, being a small park. If the Italians are terrible in organizing things, the French have done worst! 45minutes was the quickest line, 2hours the longest. Arrogant service.Fast pass would make life easier to the thousands of tourists that were at the park today,but they use it for 10% of the attractions (it is a reservation system to avoid cuing).Finally, we travelled a long trip to show Micky mouse to the young one, and guess what? At 13,lunch time, Micky disappeared to not show up again! So if you are not lucky enough to encounter him before lunch, you won't see him at all. Wefound a solution though.. the dinner at the 5 stars hotel in front of the park. 50 Europer person to eat with the Disney caracters and it was the worst food I have eaten in a long time! We even got the trolley stolen! Not fun!",-1
"I have just returned from a visit to Disneyland. We only spent 1 day in the park as this was enough.I took my 3 daughters, one is severely disable and uses a wheelchair, but can transfer out with support.I expected, once I had a  priority  green card that we would be able to go on rides without queuing, ie usually via the exit with potentially a short wait of up to 15 mins or so. How wrong!!! On all of the main rides that my daughter was able to get on, ALL of them had a  reservation  system in place. This meant that after going to the exit, we were told that we had to make a reservation (sometimes having to go back to the start!) and come back later. This ranged from 2 hours to 4 hours!!! We only arrived at the park after midday, and after looking around, viewing parades etc we only started to go to rides then. We were not told about this at City Hall. So when we arrived at Pirates of the Carribean at 4:50pm, we were told to come back at 8:30pm!!! I found this totally insane and hardly priority for disabled visitors. I complained at City Hall and they were unhelpful. I filled in a complaint form, and intend to write a strongly worded letter. This was our first and last visit to Disneyland Paris. I also found a lot of the staff sullen, rude and unhelpful. (Not all) It certainly was not a  magical  experience for our family and we were extremely disappointed with our visit. It was also a lot smaller than imagined and a lot if the focus was on up selling food drink and Disney stuff.The rides we did get on were frankly average and I can only imagine peoples disappointment at having to wait 1 2 hours to get on some. We went on 4 rides all day.The only real positives for us were the parades and we went back at night to see the fireworks which was good.there is more I have to say on the disability matter but would be here all day. Get your act together Disney, and make priority tickets for disabled visitors A PRIORITY! ",-1
"oh dear, oh dear, oh dearhaving been to Disneyland paris afew times over the past 6 years, after visiting in July 08 i would never go again!!We arrived early, 9.25. Got our tickets and then walked in! this was meant to be the early opening for the hotel guests but the staff were far too busy talking and messing around to care and just let everyone in. At 10am the whole park opened, well the took the bits of string down so you could walk past the castle. this is were our hell started...... Being British, i can cope with que'ing! i was amazed the French have even got the knack of it too, but the Spanish! at one point myself and a french guy nearly killed a spanish family! i'll set the scene.... your queing for big thunder mountain (before it has its numerous breakdowns of the day) and you see some kids going under the barriers! next thing the parents of said children are pushing you out of the way! DLP a few years ago was a nice place, the staff would stop and talk to the children, swap pin's and generally be helpful, now i think we just get in their way.i was amazed to see que's of 2 hours for Crushes coaster, the hotellift ride(forgot its name), Big thunder mountain (but i think this is because it breaks down once an hour!) and Space mountain's que was a joke!by 2pm we had been on 2 rides, tried to get fastpasses but to be honest only the ones for spacemoutain and big thunder mountain work! so we gave up and went shopping!!!!!! and went back in at 7pm! thinking that as the park would be open until 23.00 we'd have plenty of time! WRONG!!! the park started shutting down at 22.00 and all the big rides where then out of bounds as they had to get ready for the fireworks!this park COULD be so much better! if...the staff were properly trained, they had 4 times the amount of staff, which would allow them to control the que's!they actually put all the cars for the rides out to help get rid of the que's and also filled every seat on each ride!!!i'm amazed that after 16years that the park is slipping back to its bad early days, but i s'pose that while most of our european friends have a lovely day by spoiling everyone elses day, DLP will still take everyones money!think i'll save my money and just enjoy the boxing days sale' que's instead!!",-1
"Horrible expersive food!!! They have cheaped out ever since Mike Eisner took over and even now. They take kiddie rides, dress them up and tell you,  look at our new cool ride , when all they have done is put lipstick on a pig. The Orlando parks are WAY NICER. Don't waste your time in Anaheim!!! or Anaslime as the locals call it.",-1
"Now I have to say we were two adults with no children. We went for a day of fun. The visit was okay, just very expensive. Long lines and run down rides. Maybe a different experience with kids. I would not recommend for adults unless you love Disney. ",-1
"I think I hate everything about this park now. It hasn   t happen all at once, but over many years. It is trite, played, and really nothing of value to see and do anymore. Overpriced kiddie rides. Formulated and sterile, there are no surprises or WOW factor. Food is marginal anywhere in the park. You   d think after 50 years they   d reinvent at least the food and have something good and upscale. Lines, lines, lines, lines and it   s hot, sticky, and unsanitary. For us there   s no Disney magic and I think a time for Disney to turn the page and throw in the towel. Maybe focus on virtual park? People ride in a virtual world online together as a simulator. Just need to add the Smell O Rama device to any PC for urine, greasy cheeseburger and burning oil from the go kart rides. Disney will not get another cent from me and my family.",-1
"I have been to the Magic Kingdom at least a dozen times. This was the most disappointing. $610 to get in the door for a family of four. The Matterhorn, Space Mountain and haunted house were all broken down as we arrived at the entrances. Now we are told we need a fast pass to watch Fantasmic. This morning was fun, this afternoon has been a waste of time. ",-1
"disney does not limit sales so they pack the park full daily and then you have to compete with thousands of people in line for each attraction...in between you are treated rudely and hollered at by crowd control as they herd you every which way because of the parades that are never ending and that if you don't get a seat several hours ahead of time you don't see, the herding continues for fantasmic, and again for the fireworks where you are placed in roped off pens as crowded as a tokyo subway car ..if you deviate the crowd control people are downright nasty...none of this occurs at disneyworld in florida... this place has made a quick trip downghill...amazing what corporate greed can do to a good time",-1
"I dont normally give a  terrible  but I thought it was disgraceful that the park closed 3 hours early on the 31st October for a Halloween event that required additional payment No warning of this was given of this anywhere on the website, including when we bought the tickets and the hours were consistently given everywhere as closing at 10. I only found out when I check the park hours for that specific day The tickets were already peak price and no reduction or compensation was made. I wrote a letter of complaint and recieved no reply...great service! The terrible rating is, in part because I habe a right to a response to a well written and reasonable complaint.But the reality is generallity not good. It is true  the queues really are awful . The reason you have to wait 40 minutes an hour for a 2 minute ride is that Disney packs too many people into a park where there are simply not enough activities and rides. How people find enough to do for more than one day I do not know, even with hours spent queuing. Space Mountain shut down for most of the day and Ratatouille broke down when were on it. The unrelenting and aggressive merchandising is soul destroying  like being trapped in a huge theme shopping mall with a few over packed rides. The food is extortionate.My day was Ok I was with two teen kids so they were open minded, not demanding constant food and toys. But with little kids getting tired, bored and demanding things I think this would be unrelentingly awful and painfully expensive.My advice is very clear to people  either go completely off season (with your sandwiches packed) or go somewhere else   there is a very nice park in Netherlands that I dont want everyone to know about but I gave it 5 stars",-1
"We have passes and have visited and rated the park earlier, and have tried to be nice about it. The last 2 times we were there the park was so OVER CROWDED that we felt UNSAFE. When you cannot move to leave, or to walk, it's unsafe. People were everywhere, and just to get out of the park took us over 45 minutes and we only had to walk from the castle to the exit.  We wanted to see the Christmas decorations too, but it was impossible.  We chose to walk to the parking area, because the wait for the trams were almost an hour, and it was no where near closing time.  The first thing you smell as you walk thru the tunnel into the park, is the sewer. Actually, through most of the park, that is the smell.  Even tho we have passes, we won't be visiting again for a long time. It's just not worth the stress and the time.",-1
"I've been looking forward to see Disneyland since it oppened in 1992. Though im grown up today, there has allways been an inner child, looking forward to see the place, where all the charachters you have been following since a kid, is walking arround. But here is the first complaint. We spent 12 hours in Disneyland, and we hardly ever saw any of the main charachters walking arround. The only time we saw them, was at the end of the day, in the big parade. Very disapointing. The charachters, should walk more arround in the park, so visitiors(espessally the children) can take pictures etc with them. Other complaint is all the smoking. Its a theme park made for children( I know grown ups enjoy it too, with the rides etc), but come on. Every where people where smokeing. Make some smokeing areas in the park, instead of people smokeing every where. Even in the lines children an non smokers had to me choked in smoke.And this is not disneys fault, but could their not be some sort of camera in the lines, that sends people away, when they are skipping the line, cheats in front of others, or smokeing in non smokeing areas(shouldnt be allowed to smoke any where near lines etc)And last of all. We bought at souvenir for hour friends child. The toybear was damagade when we got home. The ink saftey hadnt been cleared proberly, so when we got home to the hotel, the paw where the ink saftey, was socked in ink. Disney refuses to answer, and get a refund, even thoudh we have a recipt, pictures etc of it.The 2 stars is for Space mountain mission 2, and some of the live shows, stunts etc.",-1
"The food on offer in the whole park was typical fast food   nothing better than McDonalds unless you were prepared to pay in the region of   28 each for a single course and a drink. Long queues, not all rides had fast pass, even to see Mickey Mouse in his own building (there were 2 or 3 MM so it could have taken even longer). Popular rides broke down a lot . I expected the Disney characters to be walking around all day but they only came out sporadically and then it was a 'football crowd' to try to get a photo or autograph. People smoking throughout the park, even in queues, so you regularly got a face full of smoke. Very few signs for toilets, so had to hunt for them.",-1
"Just returned from a few days away at DLP with my Mum, disabled Sister and my Brother. On the second my Disabled sisters wheelchair broke on the front wheel because of the pot holes around the park, We complained to the guest services who were very unhelpful, due to my sisters wheelchair been specially designed to meet her needs, the Disney rental wheelchairs were not suitable to meet her needs. They offered no assistance to help us resolve the unfortunate situation. We spent the next day travelling around Paris and the hospital, it seemed the attitude towards disability is very poor even the hospital would not even give us advice unless we paid. We were left very deflated and it ruined the whole holiday. On our final day we decided to use the Disney wheelchair but as it was not suitable we only managed half a day. Ill be writing an email to the complaint department. Overall very disappointed with the customer service we received in the parks and in Paris it ruined the whole holiday.",-1
"With much expectation I took my 9 year old grandson to Disneyland Paris, and he was so excited. Half way through the day his comment  they say this is the best place in the world but I think it's the worst . Why? Hours of queing to get on any ride that is worth goiung on, in total we spent about 7 hours in queues for about 40 minutes of rides. This is grteatly due to their fast pass system. Those of us who pay to go to the park and cannot lash out again on a fast pass (just a way of Disney making more money out of you) end up just waiting even longer in the queues because of those with the fast pass. mkae you feal like real secondclass citizens. On top of that absolutely everything in the park ios over priced, 19.00 Euro for a liitle photo and so on. I have to say this is bad experience and one I will never repeat, further more I woulod discourage anybody from taking children there above 8 years who will want to go on the big rides. Sadly I have absolutely nothing good to say about the placeS. Taylor",-1
"Where do I begin, I travelled to this park with three nieces and nephews, I must say that they won't remember the queues, the ridiculous price of things or the total lack of everything that I expected but here goes. I did expect queues and food on the pricey side which I don't mind paying but being blatantly ripped off is really not my thing. The queues for the rides were simply ridiculous. We waited on average 45 mins to an hour for a 3 4 minute ride. After all that nothing spectacular or mind blowing at that. Over an hour wait to have a photo with any of the characters, of which we saw 3 during the whole day (almost 12 hours) Minnie, Aladdin and the Chipmunks. Forget trying to find a Princess to have a photo with one of my nieces, although every second little girl was wearing one of their dresses from the  dress up  shop which started at    70. Having read similar reviews and my experience there is no way I would return or recommend this sham of a theme park. But you know what, my nieces and nephew will only remember the time they spent in Disneyland with their family and I'm sure they have fond memories, and that is why people continue to go. Just hate being exploited and ripped off. ",-1
"Rather than being the happiest place I'd say Disneyland in summer is more akin to Hell on Earth. We paid $420 for hopper tickets to both parks for four people. My wife and I couldn't be bothered with the massive queues for all the attractions whilst our more stoic teenage children threw themselves into it and managed four rides each all day. The place was heaving from opening to last thing at night ( we took the middle of the day off and returned in the evening hoping it would be quieter. Quite the reverse unfortunately). Unless you were willing to queue for up to an hour there was nothing to do but sit and watch the multitude shuffle by. No, forgive me, we did manage to see the animatronic Abraham Lincoln by which time I was coming over all John Wilkes Booth. Absolutely horrible. As Theme Parks go Universal is so much better and infinitely classier. To end on a positive, a big thumbs up to the oven baked pizzeria in Downtown Disney. A beacon of yumminess on an otherwise dismal and expensive day.",-1
"We were expecting a once in a life time magical trip. We were treated like criminals at the entrance. Strip searched and passing through body scanners. Security confiscated a selfie stick of ours and when we later went to retrieve it, it was not there. Hyperspace mountain had an expected wait time of 25 minutes. After 4 hours of queueing we finally made it onto the ride. Staff member Larry who was our guide on the River boat cruise was very rude and insulting. Several of the main attractions were closed due to being faulty. Not at all what I expected for a $95 ticket fee per person! ",-1
Was very excited to visit the disneyland on my trip to LA from australia but its very busy down there even on monday. Paid $97 each for 1 day 1 park.. Went with a baby and its started raining. There is not much proper shelter as everyone is trying to get inside .. and instead of helping people they start selling there overpriced umbrellas and ponchos... the food was very expensive inside and quality is 0... few rides were closed... got stuck on space mountain for 20 mins and had to come through emergency stairs around 8:20pm went there on fast pass and still waited around 30 mins in fastpass line ... no apologize though and handed a pass to skip the line for other ride when its closing in 40 mins and had to watch electric prade at 8:30 as well... had no choice but just to throw that card. Big lines and waiting times are approx 30 60 mins atleast in every ride . Staff is not friendly nor helpful as waited with the baby for 20 mins in star wars lines only to get it know that babies are not allowed on this ride. Didnt you see the people with babies . Even in front of us has a 2 year old girl and they have to get out as well. If people think that staff service in disneyland if great than the have never seen one in other countries. Come down under to gold coast's dreamworld or seaworld or movieworld here and u ll know what a helpfull staff and great service is. ,-1
"My young daughter loves Hong Kong Disneyland so we went often. We've visited the park for 9 years continuously, and we were their loyal  Magic Access Card Members . But we   ve faced constant and repeated assault by other visitors, mainly from Mainland China. We   ve been punched, finger poked, hit by selfie sticks, pushed, stepped on, verbally abused etc. Each time the staff just watched, stood there motionless, and they took no actions. I've had 10 15 minute shouting arguments with people because they've either aggressively pushed me or my child, at times in  It's A Small World  and also  HyperSpace Mountain  where the arguments echoed loudly, but the staff do not help or call any security ! When I've complained to the staff (inside the  rides  or in their  City Hall ); they refused to collect the details of the attackers and they did not call the police. In fact; they've NEVER called the police when I asked for their help ! They would say to me  It's a nice day why don't you enjoy the park and rides ! . I   ve sent emails to Hong Kong Disneyland on their security in the park but wthout real satisfaction. To force the personal security issue; on Saturday 3 December 2016 I deliberately took some goods in plain sight from the park   s  Emporium Shop  and walked out slowly until I was caught. It took them 15 minutes to catch up with me. I fully cooperated with the security staff, and I told them my reasons for my actions. My reasons being to high light the lack of personal safety and security within the park, and the fact that all of the security are concentrated in the shops to protect Hong Kong Disney's merchandise. When they caught me I was about to walk back to the shop and return the goods. I had NO intention of keeping the goods. In their INTERROGATION ROOM it was a HORRIBLE  Disney  experience. Harsh, nasty, no empathy, no understanding, a situation I found threatening because I was surrounded by three large security men. There was more security than all of the years I   ve been going there. The attending woman security supervisor ( a  Miss A    a name that sounds like a  musical ) did not care about my reasons. She refused to contact any staff to validate my written complaints. I told her whom to contact and which department, and she refused ! She stated it was another department ! She was robotic and bloody minded ! Her words to me were insulting, and dismissive for the reasons of my actions. She stated to me that they had policies and procedures to follow. I replied that her staff did not follow any policies and procedures when I and my daughter were attacked. She was silent on this. She stated Hong Kong Disneyland will charge me for  theft  and the police will escort me to the Lantau Police Station. She stated that I should take my young daughter with me to the police station because I will be there for a long time. I told her that I could not do that because it will SCARE her. She kept. on saying that  I'm an adult and I should reflect on my actions . That goes both ways ! She lacked the humanity and common sense to understand the reasons for my actions, and she wanted my child to spend hours in a police sation with me ! I spent 12 hours in a police station; and I left at 3am in the morning. Economic loss to Hong Kong Disneyland is ZERO (the goods will be returned to them). Moneatary loss to me will be in the TENS OF THOUSANDS of dollars in lawyers fee's to avoid a conviction ! And all because I was concerned about personal security and safety in Hong Kong Disneyland ! It   s clear to me that Hong Kong Disneyland ONLY cares about protecting (and selling) its overpriced cheaply produced plastic goods. When I and my daughter were attacked NO security personnel ever arrived, but when anybody takes their goods without paying then there is an army of security. The fact that Hong Kong Disneyland wants to prosecute me for my actions shows the true nature and character of the company. Yes I REGRET my actions; I was wrong to think so highly of  Disney  that they would understand my actions and the reasons for it. So much for a  caring  company. My daughter cried for several hours because I was in a police station, and my wife was immensely worried by Hong Kong Disneyland's actions against me. I was told,  by that woman , that I will be banned from returning for a year. Return there after this PHYSCHOLOGICAL TRAUMATIC  Magical Experience  ? HONG KONG DISNEYLAND WILL HAVE TO KILL ME AND DRAG MY DEAD BODY INSIDE THE PARK TO EVER RETURN !",-1
"I have been to Disneyland and Disneyworld many times and really enjoyed the experience so was really looking forward to my first holiday in 2 years at Disney Paris. Unfortunately it felt as though the ethos of Disney had evaporated leaving just the signage. Rides didn't open, broke down repeatedly or closed early. Weeds grew from some of the building in the lands and on Main Street. Many cracks and pits were evident in the pavement flooring, posing significant trip hazards. Smokers freely wandered around with no attempt by staff to restrict smoking to the designated areas. We had a good meal with excellent service in the Yacht Club and had saved the California Grill in our hotel for the last night, Thursday. What a mistake! The service was grim from the start.The prawns ordered by my friend smelt strange. In short both my friend ran from the table some minutes later to be sick in her room and I, having tried half a prawn, woke up ill at 3.45 next morning and still feel sick today (Monday). However what shocked me was the waiter's behaviour. He was annoyed that we dare complain and didn't want to order pudding. He avoided our table and was exceptionally off hand with us.Then, when you just wouldn't expect it to get any worse, we were unable to leave on time in the morning because there was nobody on any of the ground floor reception, bagage or concierge desks, although I had been able to speak to someone on the phone from the room. I found a porter down a corridor who immediately ran to find someone for us. By then there were 16 people in a queue for non existant service. Significantly, although a bell no doubt exists, it had been removed from sight. This won't put me off Disneyland or Disneyworld but the French cause is lost. Please, please Disney   reinstate Disney standards!!",-1
"First time I went there, it was just okay. 2nd time was boring! Prices are outrageous, and lines are way long. And don't you dare tell the photographers you don't want your picture taken! They'll yell at you for not doing it. Staff wasn't very friendly, and only a few rides were actually fun. I would much rather go to either Knotts Berry Farm or Walt Disney World. Not sure what it is, but Disneyland is not worth it.",-1
"This whole place feels like an homage to the 1990's. The parade was basic; the rides broke frequently or were already shut for refurbs. We waited 35 minutes in an allegedly fastpass queue because they were allowing people regardless of timing to join (big thunder mountain, the only  big  ride of the day that was open). Disney studios was better but is tiny. Most rides don't have fast passes, so we waited for 2 hours to watch the ride break in front of us! Restaurants were either shut or full or fried food. Mickeys cafe was basic food but again, we had a booking and queued for 30 minutes. Valentine, our  waitress  was rude, forgot things and mixed up the order completely. Hotel (Santa fe) was basic. Again queue for breakfast, no one pays attention to the time slots. Best thing here was planet Hollywood. And that's saying something. Whole place needs some investment and magic putting back in.",-1
"Having stayed at Disney Paris for 3 days this week it is so sad to see what Paris has to offer in comparisson to Florida and California. We have been to all 3 parks and Paris is certainly the  poor relation . Magic Kingdom was ok , but dont forget to take food and drink with you   how families cope i really dont know. Much too expensive. Although it was february and no school hols it was busy. Some attractions were not opened due to the weather. Highlight was Space Mountain and low light was deffinately the price and quality of food. I must say Disney has managed to improve customer care with all french staff attempting to speak english and smile   certainly better than a few years ago where we were treated apaulingly by staff who refused to try and understand us because our french was poor. The second day we went to Disney studios   WHAT A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY ! The park was very small and attractions limited. The weather didnt help !!! We managed to get onto Aerosmith rollercoaster twice and to see the car show   thank goodness because we didnt find much else   ok Armagedon was ok but not really that special. There were technical problems with some rides that meant alot of people were just wandering around   and when we left after just 3 hours in the park we certainly weren't alone !!!!! People were leaving to go to Magic Kingdom or like us to go to find something to eat. We went to Disney Village and managed to be charged 20 euros for 2 sandwiches and coffee !!!!! All in all , save your money and fly to Orlando   a thousand times better !!!!!!!! I relly dont know what the answer is to the problems here.",-1
The park is very small with long line ups. We did the 2 parks in 1 day ticket and can honestly say that it can be done because long line ups of some attractions made you keep walking. The other thing that was very bothersome were the people smoking everywhere. I get it that it's a European thing and that smoking is widely accepted in public places. But smoking while waiting in line with the kids? There are designated smoking areas but smoking rules are not enforced. I was looking forward to the 25th Anniversary celebration but at the end of the day ... I didn't think it was worth it to spend time here.,-1
"Considering the popularity of the park I decided to stay within Disneyland (Explorer Hotel). I found it too crowded & not worth the money they are charging. There were queues every where right from for entering the park to each & every ride. Most of the time you spend standing in queues rather than enjoying the rides. There is lot of improvement needed in that area considering the people travel from all over the world & end up standing in queues. I will not recommend to queue for any rides as they are nothing extraordinary and can be done at any other amusement work of much smaller scale. Pick the attractions which are theme based like PeterPan, Buzz Light Year & are unique to Disney. It is not worth to stand in queue for the meet & greet Disney characters. I personally would have liked the characters roaming freely across the park & available for pictures anytime. The most stunning things & must see are the parade & the fireworks at the night.Overall the shows were stunning but the queues were disappointing",-1
"Upon boarding the MTR train to Disneyland you are attracted to the specialised Disney themed train which only has one stop so there is no possibility of getting lost.It was a poor copy of Disneyworld, the street shows were overcrowded and young children could not see the performances properly. There were too many mainland tourists which made the visit even more difficult.The food was overpriced (expected) but more than double from outside was a bit steep. They did not allow food drink from outside.Anyone thinking of going should be warned there even weekdays there are many school group visits, it took us over an hour to get in on a weekday",-1
"I did not think it was possible to fit that many people in an open space. It really was ridiculous.  I thought they had a max capacity and that they respected it. If that is the case, they should review the max capacity. It was...More",-1
If you don't have little kids do universal studios instead and skip Disney. The princess castle was smaller than I expected. It was a  spinal tap  disappointment moment. The only ride that scared us was the tower hotel. No fireworks. Only on weekends. Watch park hours. They kick you out early for private partiesDisney Hotel guest only get in an hour early but you still have to line up and no one gets into the ride area until 10 so hotel benefit is smallUse the fast pass system it saves you time ,-1
"$92.00 entry pp, food and drink expensive, and there seems to be substantially more shops, souvenir stands, food and drink stands.Personally I thought it had lost a lot of it's naive charm.Sure there were the rides, but  It's a Small World  and  Thunder Railway  were both closed for refurbs.I was told that Thunder had been closed for about 12 months.The question is; should the closed attractions reflect in a lower entry price??The Jungle Cruise should have been called  The Adam Cruise , as the boat driver simply would not shut up. Inane jokes blabbering on so quickly we couldn't understand him anyway.Now look I am generally an optimist, really I am, and I have to say my wife thoroughly loved it. So go figure eh?I reckon that the money spend could have been enjoyed more elsewhere   but I don't know where.",-1
"Had a long weekend in Paris and thought a day out to Disneyland would be a perfect addition to our trip, however at the end of the day we wished we had stayed in the city for the day instead! Very expensive to get there on the train, then very very expensive to get in so already feeling a bit negative, so we went to get some food from the little pizza restaurant in 'fantasyland.' The food was horrible. It was over cooked and tasted awful, and we paid    25ish for 2 small, rubbery meals. Used some nearby restrooms as well, and these were some of the most disgusting toilets i have ever been in! Had to use multiple toilet seat covers, and when needed again, I just waited to use the much nicer toilets on the train on the way home, and I don't often find train toilets preferable to anywhere!We then decided to queue for some rides, however not once but twice were we suddenly ushered out of queues along with everyone else by grumpy, rude workers who upon questioning revealed that the rides had broken down and our 30 minutes of queuing had been for absolutely nothing. We found ourselves thinking that if they can't manage to keep the rides working in the winter, then why keep the park open and charge extortionate prices? We wasted well over an hour queuing for these 2 rides that we never got to go on, and there was no apology or explanation from the staff unless pressed. Felt a lot like a waste of money and will not be going again, and would advise people to really think twice about whether they can face the queuing, because even if you queue for a long time there is no guarantee you'll get on the ride, as they can't seem to keep them operational!",-1
"Falling quality, rising prices just about sums up DLP   the rides are fun but during our week seemed to be very prone to breakdowns and intermittent service   particularly Pirates of the Caribbean and Thunder Mountain Railroad. Extra Magic Hours for Disney Hotel guests seem pointless as most of the Adventureland and Frontierland areas remain barriered off. Surprised that the toilet facilities were of such poor quality and in general were not too clean given Disney's usual attention to detail. Staff universally (in our experience) pleasant and happy to help not to mention honest (I dropped a    120 fitness tracker in Phantom, Manor and was amazed that a staff member had found it and handed it in). Positives were a wealth of catering outlets, lots of seating, access for 'larger persons' and an outstanding fireworks and light show (albeit at 11pm). Major negative (and this is a really big one) was the lack of Disney Characters   in five days only saw Pooh, Mickey, Minnie and Goofy outside the parade........ compared with Florida that is dreadful   the overall Disney obsession with Frozen was also a little too dominant. Enjoyed the trip but have been before and enjoyed it much, much more.",-1
"Hugely expensive (  126.40 for one adult and one 14yo.) for what surely must be the smallest of Disney's park offerings. If you expect western style junk food, think again, this was worse. The rides were good. Queue discipline was at times bad with ignorant people shoving their kids past us and when their kids cried out that the adults couldn't get by to join them, we reluctantly let them through too. The fairytale castle, tiny as it is was behind hoardings as I guess they were working to add extra magic with the diggers that were there. Go to Ocean Park instead.",-1
Was expecting so much more. Almost all attractions are for children. No characters around for pictures. A lot of attractions were closed but with no previous notice for us. We expected a similar experience than disneyland in California and disney world in orlando. Its ok for kids  10. No parades or shows scheduled. Dissapointing for the price of tickets. ,-1
"Just returned from a three day holiday and am amazed at the prices. If a builder in the UK overcharged by this they would be in front of a judge for fraud!!My daughter asked to have a 20 min princess treatment, Face paint wear a dress and photo taken   60.00. If you wanted to buy a princess dress in the park they can cost up to   65.00!! that is double the UK disney store price.A hot dog and drink each for lunch be prepared to shell out over   40.00. Then you have the attitude if a lot of the staff, they suddenly shut exits at the park and when we went to take the train with two young kids and all our cases as we walked from the Disneyland Hotel to the exit that had been open all week the security guard decided to shut it and with a shrug his shoulders and make us walk away form the station to the MGM exit with no explanation as to why.When we eventually got back to the other side he had reopened it and was letting people through, this is typical of the attitude of the staff.If you want the Disney experience go to the states, the extra travel costs will be offset by the more realistic prices and the Americans can do what the Europeans cant and give you OTT customer service that makes you feel valued and give the place that Disney magic that is sadly missing in Paris.",-1
"Really? Where is the disney spirit? The cast members are rude and don't speak english. They don't even great the guests. If trash is on the floor, they leave it there. There is dirt everywhere. I wonder if the cast members ever learned the disney service basics. Where are the managers? If you want to go to a Disney Park, save your money and go to WDW Orlando!",-1
"We took 4 kids   2 aged 6 and 2 aged 8. The waiting time to get on the major attractions was about an hour. Even the lineup at Starbucks was 30 minutes! Disneyland is old with rickety rides and and trades on its reputation. If you have iPad friendly kids, it's not very interesting. Either go to Universal Studios, Six Flags or somewhere else. If you are going for nostalgia that's fine fine but you'll get over it in about 30 minutes and the kid's won't be thrilled. We went on a Friday and it was packed. Not fun. We've been to every Disneyland in the world and you can do better elsewhere than here. I think Wal would also be disappointed. Go elsewhere. We felt we wasted our time & money compared to what we could have done.",-1
"The best thing I can say about this place is that my 2 year old and 4 year old loved it.If you are thrilled by seeing people dressed up as cartoon characters, then by all means go, which probably means you have to be under 7. Aoart from that thrill, it is really quite ordinary. We went on 3 or 4 pretty standard fairground rides, which the kids loved but had to queue for 20 mins or so each time.Main St is not terribly exciting, and dont see why I should pay HK$350 to visit shops. There was a 4 minute car ride which my 2 year old loved as he could steer, but we had to queue for half hour in stinking hot weather for that. Near where we stayed In central Hong Kong, the mall had an underground funfair which was more exciting and had more rides attractions suitable for more ages than Disneyland had, and was a fraction of the price. Personally I think Ocean Park is far more interesting and has a much wider variety of attractions.But if you have to see those plastic cartoon characters, Disneyland is for you. For very young kids only.",-1
"They should pull it all down after 20 years and start again! Preferably in another country.Apart from rides not working due to 'technical difficulties', Staff with attitudes that would make Walt turn in his grave, the whole place could do with a lick of paint! 3 times we queued for rides ( at least 30 mins.) and 3 times when we approached the front we were told it was closed due to technical problems. Three separate days of queueing for the Backlot Tour at 5.15 each evening ( the park closed at 6) it would be shut down due to problems. and never re opened. The problem,IMHO,was that the staff wanted to go home early! The queues on most of the rides would be halved if they bothered to fix the broken cars. You'd think they would do this overnight, but no, the same cars would be out of action the next morning. Even a lot of the staff that were 'part of the ride' didn't get into the Disney atmosphere of things as they do in Orlando. In my opinion the French need a good kick up the rear and get their act together. After all, they are representing the great legend of Walt Disney!In contrast, the Grandchildren absolutely loved it, especially getting the Characters' autographs!!",-1
"Tickets to the theme park cost 75 euros, plus parking, plus water plus plus plus. Packed full (60 000 guests expected when it should actually host about 20 000). At least three activities closed and four momentarily out of service, for the rest: one hour and a half queues under the July sun, no shade, no trees, nowhere to sit.Staff fairly welcoming for French standards speaking their mother tongue and a few basic words of another language but not enough to be understood.Restaurant is rather expensive even for Paris standards, long wait for the main course and dessert. Steak when well done is charred black. Wait is so long children eat bread and by the time the food is brought to the table they are not hungry anymore.Go elsewhere, it is not worth it.",-1
"I hadn't been to the original Disneyland in 30 years and it was the first time I had taken our children there. We had been to EuroDisney a few years which we was not nearly as crowded. My son just wanted to go on the rides, but with lines up to 90 minutes, it's not a great experience for a 9 year old boy. As a foreigner I was surprised how 99% of the people in the park were white.",-1
"I have five members to my family and paying for D land is like having to leave them my first born. Way to expensive for us all to go. However, it was my son's B.day and he has never been to this theme park, so he and my husband went for a day of fun. They had an ok time, and would have had a better one if stuff was actually operational. My beef is with their greediness. ALOT of their rides were closed and yet they still charged full price for entry. Hmmmm how is it that we have to pay the same as someone who previously got to go on these rides but they are not made available to us for the same cost? The least they could have done is offer a two for one park pass at the cost of one park at least until all their stuff is operational again. It's too much $$$ for what you get now. Walt would not be so greedy.....I think I'll stick to Knott's Berry Farm. Good prices and they have rides you can actually go on.",-1
"I've lost count how many times I've been to Disneyland Paris over the years, and until now I've always had a fantastic time. Yes the park is nowhere near as impressive as Florida, but it generally served its purpose very well. Not this time. Too many rides are 'under refurbishment' at the same time  including Big Thunder Mountain and the Riverboat, staff were painting communal areas during the day, which just looks unprofessional, and due to the amount of things closed the lines for all of the open attractions in Fantasyland were crazy, with Fast Passes gone for the day by noon; what child has the patience to spend 2 hours in line to meet one Disney Princess! The park was open until 10pm when we visited this week, however the 'evening' parade takes place at 5.30pm with nothing else until the fireworks at park closing.The food was another issue of contention; yes it has always been expensive, but it now seems to have reached the point of being a joke  3.50 for a bottle of water, 30 Euro for 2 hot dogs, chips and drinks, and you'll be lucky to find a seat to eat it! Apparently Disney is preparing for next year's 25th anniversary, but this is no excuse to cease caring about the guests currently paying full price for a ticket to experience only half of the fun! Either wait for 2017 or save your money and take a trip to Florida, where the magic lives on!",-1
"What a let down. After coming all the way from Australia, and spending close to USD$1000 to go for just 2 days, we were disappointed with the original Disneyland, nothing like what you expect. The place is creepy, the rides are average and scary (as in weird, not as in exciting scary) and not great for kids under 10 at all. We were much more impressed the second day with California Adventure Park which is the second part of Disneyland, much more like what we expected, rides were great, not creepy and had more themed sections that kids could relate to. But overall, not overly impresssed. I would recommend California Adventure Park but not original Disneyland. Two stars and not one star only because Adventure Park was good. Otherwise, overrated, way overpriced and original Disneyland was just creepy.",-1
"Based on the recommendations of some reviewers, we planned our trip for October (low season). We bought a  one day one park  ticket, and honestly it's not worth half the money! it was unbelievably crowded we couldn't get into any site without having to wait at least an hour in each line! Plus, we were not aloud to get more than 1 express pass at a time. Very expensive restaurants, and although we were willing to pay that much, we couldn't find a place to sit... Overall, it was a very disappointing experience...",-1
We went there in rainy day so it wasn't crowded and most of the shows was cancelled it was really small and the crew was rude not helpful and not flexible with young children i will not go there again other Disneyland much more better,-1
"Really disappointing. A real surprise that it was so bad: poor on any absoilute scale and utterly shocking that Disney of all companies would tolerate such appalling standards.When we went to Disney in USA I was blown away by the professionalism & dedication to detail: friendly, clean, efficient   a lesson to people to learn from. None of that showed here, and it is a lesson only in the sense of things to avoid.Admittedly, it was half term & busy, it was a cold & rainy day, but still, that was a test   a test EuroDisney utterly, utterly failed.1) Lines for rides were very long. 1 2 hours. OK, so it happens but.....Disney is famous for its management of expectations: you see a clock saying  70 minutes wait  and I know this, so I think  60 minutes . When it is nearer 100 minutes I am staggered: not only by the actual wait but that expectation management has gone s o o o wrong.2) This is why they have FASTPASS. But the machines didn't work.Specificaly, they couldn't read the bar codes from online tickets.Long, long lines, and one poor cast member running around doing it by hand...3) Which was a consistent theme.Everywhere was understaffed. Long lines, long waits, harrassed staff.Awful.4) Some of the rides were broken. There are not *that* many so if one of the big rides ( Rock & Roller Coaster ) closes, that spills over.5) The food was *DIRE*. This is Paris: you have to search out bad food, but  boy  Disney managed it!!Waiting 40 minutes for an expensive plate of sub KFC fast food...Inedible, disgusting. Even our kids (who normally eat everything and who have mno problems with fast food were not impressed. I found it literally indeible).6) It is eye wateringly expensive.    9 for a tub of bad popcorn, incredibly expensive fast food.7) Where were the cast (1) ?The rides & concessions were understaffed, but where were the  helpers ? I don't think I saw a cast member.Again, in USA I remember being overwhemled by how many, how helpful people. Not a soul...8) Where were the cast (2) ?Where was Mickey, Buzz, Princesses, etc etc etc.Several small children were asking puzzled: they'd been promised to see them   but no one....9) Not to mention no parade, no fireworks...Paradoxical because it was Guy Fawkes w end in UK but nothing.10) Had anyone from Disney noticed they were in Paris, not in CA or FL?Has no one mentioned this in 20 years?It was cold & rainy.But that is not a surprise: the city has the same weather most years & it will rain. So plan ahead....Building a shelter to protect people as they wait in line for 2 hours is not that had: the concept of  a roof  has been known to architects for several thousand years.There were precious few places to shelter from the rain, and even fewer where you could warm up    all imppossibly crowded.The lines were cold & with rain pouring downIf this were  No Name Theme Park  I would have thought it was rubbish, serves us right for going, but what do you expect....But from Disney? Disney !!?? The company famous for professionalism, dedication to detail, micro management...???I don't own shares but if I did I would sell: this is a sign of a company that has majorly lost the plot.In the mean time, there are better theme parks in Europe (or maybe as bad, but cheaper & with lower expectations)   or save up and go to CA or FL.",-1
"The Newport Bay accomodation was dated and in poor maintenance and unclean. The cleaners had a big task so its not their fault, whilst beds were made the furniture  door handles etc were dirty, and there was dust behind the furniture. The sink kept blocking up, the lights failed and the air con sounded like a broken down truck engine if on more than the lowest setting. This shows a complete lack of respect for guests by hotel management and displays only a commercial interest in making money.The French (culturally) was a barrier to the Disney experience. They weren't always the most helpful. I did sometimes have to remind myself that I was in a Disney Theme Park. I expected to see more characters, jesters etc walking around to help create a Disney atmosphere.Food was expensive and not nutritional unless you broke the bank to eat at the Disney hotel.Some good rides and shows but I am not sure all in all that it was worth the expense and time going. What a shame DisneyLand U.S.A has put its stamp to this substandard Disney experience in Europe.",-1
"The park has gone WAY downhill lately, especially in regard to crowd control. I visited on Labor Day, which I knew would be busy. I've been to Magic Kingdom (in FL) on Christmas Day when they've had to cap attendance, so I'm fine with dealing with crowds bigger than this. However, the way Disney performed you'd think they'd never seen big crowds before. They mismanaged the traffic parking so badly it took an hour and a half to park (at 7:30am!) once we were within .3 miles of the park. Cast members kept telling us we shouldn't have come on Labor Day, which is something a customer should never be told. Multiple rides were down (with no signs out front at first!), including most of Tomorrowland. The monorail couldn't run in the heat, but they had no backup plan so guests were forced to walk to Downtown Disney hotels in the high heat large crowds   major heat stress health risks. Our security person was a rude, clueless woman which was frightening on such a crowded day, at a place like Disney.To make matters worse, Disneyland's own actions led to the chaos. Rude cast members kept saying Labor Day is one of the worst days of the year. If that's the case, why did Disney hold a marathon that weekend, bringing in more guests? Why did they allow the day to be open for annual passholders? They did nothing to cap attendance, then couldn't handle it and even complained about it to paying guests. Ridiculous for how much money you pay. Disney should be used to this by now, and have some standards.",-1
"Picture this...Buy tickets 110 minutes!Get yourself a 'Fastlane ticket': 40 minutes each!Space mountain, Starwars, Peter Pan, Small World etc.: Waiting lines vary from 60 minutes till 110 minutes!Get some food: 70 Minutes. after that no seats available!Fastlaneline: 40 minutes! Gecause this fastane line our other fastlane ticket was no longer valid!After one day we have only been in the Star Wars attraction. That was nice but it is also completly stupid to hear al this well known disney caracters speak French. Do yourself and your kids a favour and skip this parc. If Walt Disney was still alive he would wish he was dead when he lays his eyes on the French version of his dream.",-1
"I took a school trip to Disneyland Paris recently   i was very, very disappointed. Rides not working, huge queues, poor quality food.... I have taken trips there, sometimes twice a year, for the last ten years, and I am considering whether this was the last one. Some of our group went on two rides in 6 hours. I queued for two rides, only for them to break down after at least half and hour's waiting. And it's not cheap. Disney must do something. Shocking.",-1
"Disneyland should limit the amount of people they admit each day. It cost roughly $400 for a family of 4 to go there and some of the lines are 1.5 hours long. This is crazy. I know everyone wants to take their kids there but do yourself a favour, go elsewhere",-1
"The place is expensive, food is not palatable, the main landers have no clue what a queue is for. The rush from attraction to attraction and appear to be very rude folks. Ocean park gets you more bang for your buck.",-1
Since long I read and heard a lot of Walt Disneys great attraction  Disneyland . But it was not being possible for me to view in own eyes visiting USA. Last year it was a great opportunity for me to find the mini or replica of this great theme park built in Hong Kong. It was a day long experience which was tremendous and the rides and live shows were extra ordinary.,-1
"Visited on 17th May. Expensive to enter and were not informed half the attractions were closed to the public. Queued for half an hour to be told by young lady that they were closing it. No explanation or apology when asked why ? Having already visited Disneyland, Orlando which was a lovely experience compared to Disney Paris which needs to review prices and not to rip off public who cannot use attractions. Cleanliness and staff attitude needs to be reviewed. Was going to pay for my niece and family to visit Disney Paris but would certainly not consider this establishment for them or myself.",-1
"The Park looked lovely, the staff were friendly. But really I spent the day in a series of long queues, for food, for rides, for the bathroom, in shops. It was so crowded it was difficult to walk places. Some rides had queues of over 2 hours. And yes I know I could have bought a fast pass but why should I have to pay twice to go on the rides? Also, in the queues, a lot of the time we were next to French people smoking, despite the no smoking signs. I feel like Disneyland is really more like any other theme park as opposed to being similar to Disneyworld in Florida. We tried to make the best of the day but I really wouldn't go again. I can stand outside doing nothing for free at home.",-1
"II went there with a friend and our two 3 years old children.I have been to all Disneyland parks in the world (Orlando, California, Paris and Tokyo) and this one is far from the worst in all categories:First of all, the staff is awfully rude and unfriendly.  The greeting  at the main gate resembles more a scary custom check than a welcome to a fun attraction park! Don't expect anyone from the staff to smile or to be cheerful there; they have simply not been trained for that!The service in the shops and the restaurants is equally horrible!And yes the guests, mainly Mainland Chinese are quite undisciplined but I was expecting worse and at least they were the only people who actually smiled at our 3 years old kids!The queues are long and the attractions are quite boring. It's not a children friendly place; so avoid this park, especially if you travel with very young children. On the bright side, the park is very clean. My advice, if you want to go to Disneyland, the best ones in terms of service and attractions are in the United States (Orlando   s Disneyworld No1 and Disneyland Anaheim No2).",-1
"We went to Paris Disney having been to both parks in the USA. It was a miserable experience four rides were either broken or developed faults. Drinks were difficult to get hold of after 1800. Almost every queue time was too short in one case by almost an hour. We queued 55 mins for one ride which when we arrived at the front stopped working. It was strange seeing people smoking. In America my overall impression was one of joy and people having fun. In Paris almost everyone was glum. If you have small children this could be fun, everyone else should try other amusement parks.",-1
"If you like being ripped off by Disney merchandise shops then this is the place for you; there are plenty of them. The Disney Village is free entry to a whole host of restaurants and not much else. Disneyland Park and Walt Disney Studios are what you pay for. There are some good major attractions in the park and the Studios. The Park is fantastic for young kids and the Studio's for older kids. But they'll get bored quite quickly. A day is all that's needed (if it wasn't for the queues). I went for the new year's eve (2004) 'spectacular.' The only thing spectacular was the crowd. There was no limit to the amount of people they let in to Main Street USA, where everybody wanted to be, with no alternative exits. The amount of idiots with pushchairs (and double pushchairs) made matters worse. The resulting crush was unbeleivable and the show wasn't worth the hassle.If you're staying in one of the Disney hotels your bus ride to and fro is fine as there are plenty of the yellow Disney buses laid on. If you're in one of the four outlying hotels be prepared for mass hysteria as everyone in the four hotels tries to cram on to one of only two purple PEP buses that serve them. No one seems to care how many kids get crushed or trampled as they try to get on the bus. There is no system for getting a bus so it just turns into a free for all as people queue jump and knock other people to the floor.Go to the US parks, its much easier, better, and more value for money.",-1
"We visited this venue for second time after a ten year gap, with Florida Disney parks visited twice during the ten year gap. The ten years showed, the staff are not as helpful as Florida or indeed as they were, there were one or two who really had the nice day disney attitude. Five of the big rides were out of service for unspecified technical faults with people being allowed to cue for long periods before being told. The cues for rides we experienced were never in line with the indicated times, the worst said 30 minutes and actually took 1hour and 10 minutes. Dismal disney performance we won't be going back, Florida next time.",-1
"We booked this trip for my son's 5th birthday, we stayed in the Sequoia Lodge for 3 nights 4 days. On arrival check in was smooth and we went straight to our room to feed me one year old daughter, there was no kettle in the room which I was quite surprised about I called reseption 4 times and after an hour one eventually arrived!!! Not a good start! We proceded to the park which was a 10 15 min walk from the hotel. When we got there it was so busy the queues were too long. We managed to get on a few of the smaller rides and decided to brave the queues the following day. I have to say and I may be generalising but the French really don't seem to like Brits, it was quite apparent from both the french public and the staff especially at the hotel. Having been to Florida I have to question the positioning of this park as they didn't seem to have the same hospitality skills to deliver the  Disney Magic !!!!! Also no one seemed to know how to wait in line it was definatley evryone for themselves. I was surprised at how small the park was and the tour in the studios was poor. If I had to sum up the park and hotel I would say if is a very poor relation to Disney in the USA. One last comment, everyone seemed to be smoking in all areas and as it was so busy it felt very claustrophic and ash was flying everywhere and I was worried about me daughter who was in the pushchair!!! There were designated smoking areas but these weren't enforced and it was a free for all. Despite all this my son really enjoyed it which was the min point of the holiday but as for me its never again!!!",-1

"Went to Disneyland yesterday and it totally missed my expectations. There were broken rides everywhere! Indiana Jones, Barges to the Island, Pirates of the Carabean, Peter Pan.... Some would be down for an hour some would be down more. Went over to the California Adventure Park and the Elevator Ride only had one of three elevators working. And the Crowds!!! If you are going to have broken rides then reduce the number of people entering the park. There were a lot of Disney Characters but those lines were long...always. The park is getting old and tired. They should either get their mechanical act together or reduce the number of tickets available. I recommend Six Flags or another park. You get some of the same kind of thrill rides without the high entry cost. Sad",-1
the theme park had a lot of maintenance problems and was to crowded. plus you have to wait a long time at each attraction and they have special tickets so that rich snobs can go first (Always fun when you've been waiting over an hour with you're little kids)  some attractions were maintained bad (another nice thing to notice after you've been waiting more than an hour),-1
I can not think of one good reason to recommend Disneyland Paris for English people. With the current exchange rate the prices are just ridiculous   20 for a sub standard burger and chips or   17 for a kids meal. We enquired about the buffalo bill wild west show but at   240 for a family of 4 we decided against it!!!!The queueing system leaves a lot to be desired with people (locals) pushing in all over the place and the whole experience left us moping around in the hotel for 6 hours on our last day of 3 looking forward to going home.If you are thinking about going DONT DO IT.,-1
We were so disappointed with Disney.  Just one big line (queue) designed to force everyone to spend as much time (and therefore money) in the park.  Walt would feel let down.,-1
"We recently went to Balboa Island on vacation with the family. We also have never been to California but figured since we were so close that visiting Disneyland was a MUST!. We went in February which was off season and everything was just okay. It was so overcrowded. Even being offseason, i can't imagine what the busy season looks like or how you could even function.Everyone is packed together and the park is pretty outdated and it shows. For the amount of money Disney brings in and charges they should be ashamed of the condition of the park. Just slapping new paint on old rides and giving it a new name. I know its a type of marketing and branding but the park size is just way to small for the amount of people to go in there.People are rude, My daughter and wife got puked on by some guy getting off a ride at the park. Ive also been to Disney world as we are from the east coast. If you are reading this based on choosing... Go there. its the same cooperate structure but it is far larger and superior as parks go. If I had a choice now i would have gone to knox berry farms instead.",-1
"We went the 1st week of February when it was supposed to be quiet and then Disney announced  annual passholders  month. It was the busiest I've ever seen and we've been going for years. Parents are so rude, learn how to get into a line instead of pushing you, your husband and your double stroller through in front of everyone else for the security check line. I think everyone would benefit if they would walk on the correct side of the path. So many people walking at you and they act like you're in the way. Cast members are grumpy. None of them were smiling. Sat on a water bottle on Haunted Mansion, handed it to the cast member and she says  oh, thanks, I've always wanted one of these  not sure why they've given up cleaning rides. Not sure if or when we'll go back, prices are so high even though so many things were shut.",-1
I visit Disney on Thursday at 10.00 am its was not crowded put most of the things was closed to 12.00 and its so smaller than the one in France ..and there wasn't international food only local food ..and fish smell all over the place. .its waste of time i don't recommend it at all. ,-1
"Myself, along with my two chidren ages 8 and 17 visited Disneyland California from December 15   21. We experienced a half day of reasonable weather on Dec. 15, and thereafter the heavens opened up, and it poured, like nothing we had experienced before, for the next 5 days straight. The main problem with this, is that there is extremely little drainage in the entire Disneyland Park. This made for small lake size pools of water throughout the Park. The huge deluge of water everywhere in the Park, for days on end, also caused approximately fifty per cent of the rides to be closed at any given time, for the duration of our holiday. Not good, when you have paid several thousand dollars, for a family Disneyland vacation, during Christmas. This was extremely disappointing, to my two children, and myself. Disneyland gave guests no compensation for operating at approximately fifty per cent functionality. I find this business practice to be completely unethical. Also, when I asked various Disney employees, why they were closing numerous rides, they dismissed me, walking straight past me, without speaking. Very arrogant and rude. This was our fifth and last trip to Disneyland California. In the future, we will choose a holiday destination, where we will be treated decently, and where the weather is more predictable.",-1
"Very very small, disappointing all along the line... the park is too small, without big attractions. In 3 hours you will have seen everything. There was construction with a lot of noise during our visit. It was ridiculous to visit the enchanted forest when you heard a jackhammer!! The maneges are limited. The prices are high for the quality of the park. It is better to keep your money and invest it in another activity ",-1
"I'm comparing this to FL Disneyworld and there's simply no comparison. The park was dirty and the staff was not engaging at all. I didn't feel magical here (you will in FL though). The lines were long, signage was terrible, and not enough dining experiences. I did enjoy the Christmas lights and the company of my family, but the park was pretty terrible. I won't every return here.",-1
"bought 2 Disneyland tickets for me and my daughter who is terminally ill as this was one of her dying wishes , however within a month of buying the tickets her condition significantly worsened and she is unable to travel to France , I emailed them twice explaining the situation and asked if I could get a refund so myself and my daughter could do something together in the uk to get no response , spoke to them on the phone yesterday but they blank point refused to let me have a refund . Gave me an email address of another department , so I explained the situation and this is the response I received,  We thank you for your e mail and your interest in Disneyland   Paris.We are sorry to hear about your daughter.We regret that the conditions of  Print at Home  tickets are very strict and therefore your tickets are non refundable, non exchangeable and non transferable, therefore we are very sorry we cannot provide you with a refund.Absolutely disgusting , what's   130 to Disney , never giving them a penny again ",-1
"Having spent four days here, the most excruciating thing is the amount of time wastes queuing with young children (3,4 and 6). One queued to meet characters as they spring up around the park, queue to go on rides that always underestimated the waiting time, queue for a painfully long time to get a meal or snack, and queue to enter the premises   security and tickets. Although we managed to take in many of the rides, features and entertainment on offer, we were left feeling exhausted at the end of each day which marred the experience for our children as we were so fractious by the end of the day! The only thing you needn't queue for is the shops. There are tons of them and what I found inexcusable is the fact that they Jack UP the prices on site. A princess dress will set you back up to    70. The UK disney stores are cheaper. Shouldn't it be that in Disneyland they ought to cost less?There are too many people entering the grounds. Disney is a greedy, corporate machine and we shall not be retiring to Disneyland Paris anytime soon. Tips: 1) take empty refillable bottles and some squash.2) get food elsewhere if you can. It's expensive, slow and not great quality on site. 3) get your kids something from your local disney store first. You'll save at least 1 3 off the price of items on site. 4) go to America. ",-1
"We visited in March 2011 and it was our fifth time. There won't be anymore. The Pirates of the Caribbean ride was closed due to refurbishment. This was a massive dissapointment as it is arguably the best attraction they have. The was a hoarding outside the front reading 'closed for refurbishment and you future entertainment'. Do these people think we can just pop back over when they've finished? Another popular ride, Big Thunder Mountain, was also out of action for two days due to technical difficulties. This was the nail in the coffin for me. As a result of these closures, there was around four or five hundred extra people in circulation . This made the place a lot busier and queueing a nightmare for everything except 'It's a small World' because nobody wants to go in there anyway! The French were the usual arrogant and impolite people we have expected them to be. The prices in and around the parks have become astronomical. Just under Seven Euro's for a pint of warm beer. The food was also horrendously expensive and largely awful. For what it cost us as a family of Four, we could have gone to Spain for a week and probably had a much better, and less stressful time. We will never, ever go back to Disneyland Paris. They need to stop ripping people off!",-1
"Having been to California Disney many times, Hong Kong pales in comparison by far. Fewer rides, different vibe, awful food. If you have time and want to spend the money, go. Just know what you're in for. We struggled to find enough to do for 5 hours, rode a few rides multiple times even, and were done. We went in November when the weather was decent and found it warm. Cannot imagine going in the heat, let alone with children. ",-1
"Love Disney but we were seriously let down by here.Very long queues, we went early Sept. Smoking everywhere,now I am a smoker and I was even offended at people lighting up beside me at meal times(we were outside but still ). IT IS EXPENSIVE,even if your kids stay and play for free,they need food and drink through the day unless you plan on starving them,the shops merchandise is over priced and its the same stuff in each shop,there were no where near enough characters in the parks.The toilets stank,not what I ever expected in a Disney park. Disneyland Paris workers need to take a few Disney courses,learn how to smile,make you feel wanted. We were only there 3 days and we managed to have a laugh at it all but I wouldnt recommend staying any longer than that.Cant wait to go back to Orlando,thats where the magic really is.",-1
"So we booked a 2 day 2 park trip to EuroDisney for our Daughters 21st birthday surprise. The tickets we purchased a while ago with ease. However when we got to the park, we found around half the rides closed for maintenance, which meant the queues for the rides that were open were for the most part over 90 mins and in some cases 150 mins. Spending so long standing around meant we also didn   t get to see any parades or shows.I understand the need to maintain these rides but to have so many shut at once really causes issues with wait times across the rest of the parks.We managed 3 rides in the day   5hrs queuing for 6 mins of rides. Needless to say we   re not going to waste our time on using the tickets for day 2 and spend our time in Paris instead. This really put a dampener on what should of been a fantastic surprise for our daughters 21st.Really not value for money and the only memorable part of the day was standing around in a Queue.I know we could of purchased fast pass, but this on top of an already expensive ticket would of broke the bank.Not value for money and certainly no magic!",-1
So disappointed   they let far too many people into this much smaller version of Disneyland and it is hideously overcrowded. Waiting times for EVERYTHING are at least 35 mins according to the signs but that is a massive lie. Even the Fast Track is ridiculous as we tried at 11am and the come back time was 3.50pm. What a joke for small children. The parents are incredibly aggressive considering it is a kids theme park... where is the love?? The waiting obviously short circuits brains. They should restrict how many people enter the park and maybe it might be more enjoyable. Hated it and couldn't wait to get out of there and the food??? Fried food extravaganza.. horrible. Would never go again and strongly advise parents to find another park to go to... there is another fantastic park around Paris that we went to with rides etc and no waiting. If you have older kids maybe ok but for young children waiting an hour per time to get on a ride is not a fun day for them and even less so for their parents.,-1
"I am currently trying to find the best place to formally complain about my recent break to Disney land Paris.I honestly don't know where to begin with the list of complaints..........The security on entering the park is fairly non existent. There were 4 adults and 4 children in our group and most days they ushered us through with out any checks at all. Given recent circumstance this left us slightly nervous. The park looks almost shut with boarding up EVERYWHERE saying under renovation for your future enjoyment. The majority of the large rides were shut, restaurants all around closed up, and some of the big shows again closed!This caused the queues at the remaining rides and shows to be insane. A serious lack of staff throughout the park leading to smoking everywhere even though it states it is non smoking. We stayed 5 days and due to the closures and queues we were only able to appreciate around 50% of the parks.Horrendous and costly experience.My advise is don't go.",-1
Disneyland HKG   been here several times over the years and we were back again today   the rides are still good and especially the updated ones BUT the cast look miserable and it has a huge impact on the whole experience. The staff need to know 'smiling' is the most important part of their job!!,-1
"My husband and I don't have children, but we thought we would still at least have fun. That can't be farther from the truth. We went to Disney on Saturday, May 19th, only to find out that the park was closing early due to a  special event , which turned out to be the premier of the Pirates of the Caribbean   3. We opted to pay the $83.00 to get into Disney and California Adventure   another mistake.When we walked into Disney, there was a red carpet all down main street and people sitting around in sleeping bags, chairs, etc. and you could barely walk around. It was not possible to cross the street because of the press hoopla and the red carpet. Then, as we made our way through Disney, many different sections were closed because of the  special event'. Several of the rides were closed and the lines for those that were open were ridiculous. I went into one of the gift shops and asked the lady at the counter if it was always this busy and she said this was nothing and that typically, you can barely walk around. Ugh. We paid a regular priced admission, but did not have access to the entire park and the park closed early. Granted we don't have kids, but this experience has completely turned us off on any future Disney visits. Even if we have kids in the future, we won   t go back.",-1
We've just come back from DisneyLand Paris and 6 rides (including the main ones   such as 'Hyperspace Mountain' weren't working). I wouldn't mind if we didn't have to queue for an hour for all the remaining rubbish rides but I think it was just a waste of time and money,-1
"This is a hard review for me to write since I have been to Disneyland countless times over the years with my daughter (who is now 11). I have a lot of respect and admiration for the creators, artists, and innovators of Disney movies and attractions. These men and women are truly inspiring. Walt would be proud. Who I don't have a lot of respect for are the greedy corporate shills that have taken Walt's vision for Disneyland and tossed it out the window in the name of profit maximization. It's pretty ridiculous, and last weekend's trip to Disneyland will be my last. Here are a few cold, hard truths about Disneyland:1) Way too crowded all day everyday. There is no off season.2) Ridiculously long waits for rides (because it is too crowded)3) Fast pass system inefficient (because it is too crowded)4) Obscenely expensive everything (all goods made in china cheap quality)5) Terrible food (minimal healthy choices stupid expensive)6) Terrible value for the amount of $$$ spent (you pay to stand in line)7) People are herded around like human cattle (it's disheartening to watch)8) There are lines for everything (and I mean everything)Overall, I can't imagine why any would want to drop hundreds, and even thousands of $$$ to essentially stand in line all day for a few minutes of fun. It just doesn't seem worth it. The only ones benefiting from this system are the suits. That is it.",-1
"The experience was quite disappointing for those who have done other Disneyland Parks (even for those who have just done Disney Hong Kong). The first thing that strikes you is that the staff does'nt smile, greet or is very friendly. In fact some of them are not helpful at all. Was quite shocked when I asked for directions to a particular attraction and one or two staff members just shrugged their shoulders and one of them said they have no idea! The other thing that strikes you is that you barely see any characters (other than during character Meet & Greet) walking around (unlike at Universal Studios Singapore). Shows are very very average. Just not worth it unless you have young children who insist.",-1
"We recently visited Disneyland on Saturday, October 7, 2017, and had a rather unfortunate experience. My husband and I were able to enjoy most of the park on a busy day (due to much strategic planning and use of the fastpass system). That was great as it was his first time, but it'll probably be our last time.A huge damper was put on our visit when we went to ride Splash Mountain. I was so excited to ride as we used one of our fastpasses and bypassed a 90 min lineup. I was worried when we were put in a boat with four other men (my husband and I are by no means tiny) but I figured we would be fine if a cast member thought it was okay for that much weight in the boat. The ride was great, we had a monumental tidal wave that thoroughly soaked us   all in good fun!What was NOT fun at all was when we got to the unloading zone the boat was too heavy to make it back up the mechanism   we were stuck just beyond the emergency exit. After about 15 mins the cast members unloaded all of the other boats but told us to stay where we were. Due to liability, the jump to make it back to the emergency exit was too big. We needed to stay where we were in order to not be escorted out of the park. The fire dept had been called and would be coming soon.More than 60 minutes later the firemen showed up, only to tell us  Sorry it took so long but someone called us and told us you didn't need us anymore . That was NOT something that you want to hear after waiting for so long to be 'rescued'.In the 60 minutes that we waited our boat was a spectacle for all the people in line. We were pointed and laughed at, photos and videos were taken. Some of the men in the boat were visibly very uncomfortable with the additional attention and requested numerous times that the lineup to be cleared from sight to stop the ridicule. Nothing was done   Cast members themselves all came to check out the situation   not to be confused with 'Check on'.At no point was there communication to us or regular updates   there was no 'are you okay' from cast members, or can we get you anything. One request made by another one of the men was just a simple plastic bag as his phone and camera had been soaked and ruined from the splash   he had to ask four times.The issue isn't that we were stuck or that we had to wait. I get it, rides break, stuff happens and it's all a part of the experience. The thing that's so upsetting is that this is DISNEY. The epitome of customer service and the place where the magic happens, NOT a place to be pointed and laughed at, underserviced, or shrugged off.I followed up with Disney customer service and received a cookie cutter canned response  we're sorry the ride broke  and  we're sorry you had bad service  cut and paste out of an employee manual.I completely understand that things happen, rides and attractions have technical difficulties. Our experience was a little beyond 'disappointment over the temporary closure of Splash Mountain', it was the fact that we WERE the temporary closure of Splash Mountain as a result of poor judgment of the staff. As such we were treated distastefully by all staff, not to mention the harassment and spectacle we endured during the wait.We had already missed the fireworks.Visiting from Canada for the weekend we only had one day in the park. I asked if we could talk to someone about the possibility of a meal voucher or gift card for the shops we were shrugged off and they told us to go to 'city hall' customer service, where I could wait again and lose the rest of our ONLY evening. We had at this point already lost almost 2 hours of our very limited time in the park.It would be nice to receive a genuine apology for myself and the other men in the boat. This is Disney... the epitome of customer service and the go to example used in all experiential marketing. I'm hoping they can make it right and restore the magic in my eyes.I would also strongly encourage a weight distribution disclaimer for your staff at Splash Mountain   rather than cramming the boats full, consideration of safety first.Disneyland is NOT what it used to be.",-1
"Let me preface by writing we have been to Disney Florida and Disney California. Took my 4 year old twins to HK with me on business and decided to bring them to HK Disney as a treat. My children are biracial Caucasian Asian. I am Caucasian, mom is Asian.My son has light brown hair dark blonde hair and hazel eyes with some minimal Asianfeatures (e.g., no epicanthic eyefold so his eyes look more Westen while his bone structure is more Asiatic). His twin sister has a darker complexion and aside from medium brown hair eyes, she looks like a light skinned Asian toddler.My son was constantly hassled by Japanese and Korean patrons in the park, mostly obnoxious women between the ages of 30 40 years old who not only asked completely inappropriate and racists questions of my wife and I, but also thought it acceptable andOK to take selfies with my son. One of the women, a woman from Osaka, keptreferring to my son as  cute half breed boy. I put a stop to this after around the 8th or 9th Japanese Korean woman did this (mind you this was in the first two hours we were in the park). The final straw for me was when we went to a Disney stage show and the had an Asian woman made up in black face paintperforming a circa  1950's America  song a la Beans & Cornbread in front of a thousandlittle kids.Given the insane price of entry, small size and limited features of this Disney park, notto mention the  merchandizing attempts  every five feet and the profoundly racist experiences we had to deal with, I am crossing this off as a  we'll visit them again  place for the kids. The Ocean Park nearby is much better and nobody thought my childwas a park attraction toy for taking cell phone photos.I'd skip Disney HK and opt for the stateside parks. Maybe we will try Disney Shanghai with better luck.",-1

I have visited Disneyland about 25 times over the last 40 or so years. I have seen many changes. I took my children when they were young. I have taken some of my grandkids here. This was the worst ever visit. The price is way too expensive. Much of the park was closed. Even Small World was closed. The steamship Columbia doesn't move. Tom Sawyer Island... closed. Old Bear Country area closed. Then they closed the park at 6PM so they could charge another $70 for Mickey's Halloween party. Greed is the word of the day now at  The Most Expensive Place on Earth .,-1
"I have been to Disneyland and Disneyworld several times. It used to be that Disneylands charm and simplicity kept it somewhat competitive with its larger, Florida based cousin. Now, its not even close. Disneyworld seems to have an endless budget to help your kids get lost in the fantasy...especially characters dressed up everywhere. At Disneyland, we only saw two characters the entire day. The biggest difference is that because 'Land is in the middle of the same 20 million people every day, its not just a target destination for traveling families, but  frequent fliers  who are no where near as polite. At allmost every line someone would cut in front, and the employees just watched. It was very upsetting to have your toddlers and children patiently wait 40 minutes, then have to watch (typically locals) people just step in front at the last second. If you say anything, you make a scene if front of your kids. If you dont, you are not a good role model. I didnt pay several hundreds of dollars to have to deal with that...the employees should. As your kids get older, Disney overall isnt as much fun. There are only a couple of  thrill  rides, as compared to other amusement parks which have several.Having said all of that, the park is clean and the kids had a good time.",-1
"Crowds were horrible for the 60th anniversary...We attempted to go last Monday to Disneyland.. (one day park hopper) ...we waited 1 2 hour in line and only moved 5 feet in our attempt to enter the front gates of the park...after that we decided to leave and come back another day. apparently there was a longer check in period for those with multi park passes having to show IDs etc. However, there was no structure or organization to the process so everything was incredibly slow and backed up into both parks.FYI if you decide to leave: keep your parking ticket, you can get a refund within 3 hours of purchase,and you have one hour to return a scooter for full refund. D land tickets purchased online are good for about 1 year after purchase...",-1
"Although Disneyland is favored by people from all over the world, however I'm pretty upset, and I'm sure I'm not the only one, on the admission prices just to get into the park itself, 75 , that just does not seem reasonable for those who have more than two children...I still love  It's a small world  and the many attractions they have to offer, but the prices of this  Magical  place leads me to believe that the average  Joe  and his family are not welcomed, and it's only for those who can afford such an exspence...If this is suppose to be an American past time then why can't everyone enjoy it without having to sell children, tv's, and valuable items just for the price of a ticket?",-1
"We have just returned from a family trip to Disneyland Paris. My two sisters and I decided to take our daughters aged 4 6 and 7 for a day and night. Well firstly can I say that this trip is costly. Everything about Disneyland is expensive. It cost us over   50 per ticket for entrance into the park and what do you get for this??? It seemed like we were walking around a park with hardly any good rides. My first impressions was that it was dated. Have they not updated this park since it first opened 20 plus years ago. Disney you really need to move with the times. The castle is plastic looking and not real like. Where is the Disney characters waving from the balcony? The rides are out dated. We queued for some ride called Le Pays Des Contes De Fee, according to their leaflet it's not to be missed. Well it a small boat ride around some lame small wooden scenes from Disney movies. My daughter could have made in nursery. Where is the animations. Where is the 3D cinematic rides that take you through a journey of Disney film adventures. Where is the holographic Minnie and Mikey waving at you as enter the park? Where is the Elsa and Anna Characters? Your most successful Disney film to date and you haven't decided to make a frozen castle? Where is the magic? All I saw was a couple of unpopular Disney characters in the park where you have to que hours to have a pic with. Mickey and Minnie well expect over a 2 hour queue to meet them. You should have a proper theatre auditorium where visitors can sit properly to see a property show. It seems Disney you have lost your magic, This park is not about the children this is a money spinner. Everything is about making money. We booked to have lunch with the Disney princesses 70 EUROS PER PERSON! The kids menu was Cinderella bites to start and pasta for main. Well what came out for our young kids to eat was laughable. Quails eggs and a load of salad leaves in a bowl. You call that Cinderella bites. Kids don't eat food like this. The pasta a tiny bowl of plain pasta with a small portion of tomato sauce on the side. What a disgrace. The manager said but you pay for the princess experience. Oh what Cinderella Ariel and sleeping beauty walking around the restaurant for half an hour. WHERE IS ELSA AND ANNA or your up to date characters. They should all be in the park every single day. This is a Sham! Sorry but I truly think Walt Disney would be turning in his grave. Bring back the real magic of Disney where kids truly experience good food and great quality attractions and entertainment. Why don't you bring in a macdonalds into the park and a pizza express? Decent food chains. Your greed means you are so lacking in quality. Very very dissappointed. I would say to a family saving all their hard earned cash to go. DONT BOTHER..",-1
"I waited a couple weeks after returning from our California trip to let my thoughts about Disneyland sink in. We have never been to Disneyland or Disneyworld for that matter so we were novices. We only scheduled one day at the park and looking back on it i wish we had skipped it. First off let me tell all those who are worried about crowds  there is good reason to be. We went on a Monday at the end of April and i have never seen crowds like that  and don't want to again. We basically paid $300 (entrance for 3) to wait in line all day to ride four rides. I'm sorry  but that's ridiculous. Rides are fun, but the shortest queue we came across was 90 minutes. Many of the rides were closed for maintenance so maybe that put more stress on the operating rides, I   m not sure. The fast pass did help a couple of times and yes, we got right on the rides, but that whole process is ridiculous as well. This cheerful attitude that is always mentioned in these reviews was not present on the day we visited except by the parking attendant. Maybe i need a fast pass for that as well? The food and souvenirs are beyond ridiculous in price. Amusement parks are supposed to be fun. Disneyland is not.",-1
Hotel Magic Circle was ok. Breakfast was very good. BUT Disneyland Paris was so disappointing. The place needs upgrading with more rides and needs the magic and sparkle advertise on their website. There doesn't seem to be a cap on numbers allowed into the parks so they were crowded with waiting times around 75 mins per ride. (Some fast pass machines were broken). With the extortionate price of tickets it works out at tens of pounds per ride!! The staff in the parks seemed indifferent to visitors with a take it or leave it attitude. The only saving grace was the parade and the evening fireworks. A sad experience   definitely better in the USA.,-1
"Lots of rides were shut down due to renovations and the rides that were open kept closing due to technical problems. For example, I went to ride Splash Mountain and was in line 4 times before it was working long enough to get on finally. Way to many people for so many things to be going wrong. :( ",-1
"Just come back from a 3 day visit to Disney Paris. We have been many times before but it seems they have  lost the plot .We travelled with daughter and 5 grand children looking forward to giving them a similar experience to what we had previously experienced, only to find that not one ride had less than 60 min waiting time including children's rides, the main adult rides were 90 mins plus and fast pass availability 4 to 5 hours in advance! We only achieved 6 rides over 3 days! Costing over   1000 for the tickets is daylight robbery.Both parks were the same problem far too many people being let in and hardly able to walk down the main street.We had to go to Macdonalds to get anything to eat as no tables or capacity for eating anywhere in the park.We admit the exchange rate is poor at the moment but paying thousands of pounds to barely move around in the overcrowded park for 3 days is hardly worth it. Far better to save the money to go to Florida where the staff at least are friendly and welcoming and you can actually get on a ride in a reasonable time.",-1
"For an anniversary year I found it hard to believe that one of the best rated attractions was closed. Pirates of the Caribes. The never ending queue still amazes me, they have just gotten worse since I first visited the park en LA 35 years ago. I guess the greed rules. With little news and a noise level of the box music that I hope hell will not provide if I go there.Well something positive as well. The staff 100%, cleanliness 99% and a well maintained park.",-1
"Rides were good, need a lot of patience. Family of 4 got in a combined 14 rides, ( 3.5 rides each)(3 mins each ride) waited an average of 40 minutes  ride. Figured it cost $1:00 minute for my family to be in eurodisney. ($500.  for the day).Waited 20 mins to get coffee, 35 mins to get a bite to eat etc. etc.Poor value for money because of poor organisation by Disney. Dread to think what it is like in peak periods.",-1
"Visited Disneyland July 14 16th 2013. Cost of two day park hopper for just my wife and I $420.00. With this was our hotel accommodations, expensive Disney food, we total out at $800.00. Even if everything went perfect this still is way too expensive. But we experience Disney during a two day period that included five attraction breakdowns and heard from others of two more. We approached an attraction that posted a 30 minute stand by time, an hour and 15 minutes later we were told that the ride was experiencing technical difficulties and that we could leave and come back later. Huh, fat chance! This was typical for our other experiencesNot only is Disneyland food expensive it borderline edible. We have decided to forgo anymore Disney corp. vacations and seek other  more bang for the buck' options. Our advice when you are considering a Disney vacation, Don't!",-1
"This is my second review about Disappointing Disney The saga goes on, my granddaughter like most little girls dream of meeting princesses in castles, so we booked the very expensive princess lunch, but after the terrible time we had over the last few days with all the queues for everything and not been able to eat because restaurants are so full or fully booked (read my first review) meeting The princesses seemed like a lovely afternoon in the hellhole of Disney. We ordered our lunch and sat in anticipation to wait for the princesses my granddaughter dressed just like the pretty princesses suddenly she then started to feel unwell so we went to bathroom where she started to vomit, we told our waitress to cancel our meal. My granddaughters dreams shattered, her princess dress covered in vomit, all of us distressed to see her distress and again Disney did not disappoint all they wanted was our money for food we did not get to eat!! We did ask them if they were serious as obviously we didn   t eat the food and told them to cancel it but they were serious and made us pay for price for this shattered little girl dream!! Disney the land of trickster! ",-1

Food was terrible yet at exorbitant price. definitely will not recommend any tourist to visit. it will be a whole day wasted.",-1
"Disneyland was very disappointing, huge crowds, very long wait. We will never go back, it did not worth almost $100 entry fee.MovieWorld, DreamWorld, SeaWorld and other attractions at Gold Cost are better value, better rides and not as many people :) We went to Disneyland on Monday , hopping that crowds will not be too big. Disappointed.",-1
"If you have been to Disneyland, Florida this resort will not even come close in comparison. The queues are crazy with unrealistic waiting times displayed. There wasn't a single thing that we didn't queue for, rides, food, toilets, etc. The magic experience that is so important in America is lacking here. Over hour long queues for a two minute photo opportunity with the Disney characters for my little boy, whereas in Florida they are regularly around the parks.  We queued for well over an hour for the Pirates of the Caribbean ride, which then broke down and left us sat on it for 30 minutes with promises of it being running again shortly. Eventually we were evacuated with not a single word of apology, let alone anything complimentary as a gesture of goodwill!We had a two day break with a park hopper ticket and on the day we were in the Disneyland Park managed approx three rides. We had to leave a queue to meet Mickey Mouse with one very disappointed little boy having waited for 30 minutes with the queue not moving. Dinner took an hour and a half, having waited for food, then having to sit on the floor to start off, eventually managing to grab a dirty vacated table. This place is so over crowded, commercial and lacks the resources and customer experience!",-1
"Prices are high, crowds are bigger than ever , lines are longer than ever, food is worse than ever in the park, to put it simply , the magic is gone . To pay 240.00 for two days for the chance to be trampled by parents running with their little ones tucked in strollers when early entry into the park starts. Not to mention when there is early entry at Disneyland , there were only 2 parts of the park opened, Fantasy Land and Tomorrow Land. The other parts open at 9AM when there is the second running of the strollers. I can not imagine if they had to evacuate the park in an emergency what would happen. Disney seems only concerned about how many butts they can pack into the park.On the plus side the water shows at night in California Adventure were amazing. Restaurants will not let you check in for your reservation no more than 10 minutes prior to your time.MAKE RESERVATIONS FOR ALL DINING IN THE PARK, EVEN FOR BREAKFAST. YES , EVEN FOR BREAKFAST!!!!I have been coming to the park since 1979 and have never had a worker be short or rude to guests. This time it happened 3 times. I do believe it had to happen sooner or later, the amount of people that are at the park would even try the patience of a saint.Good bye Disney , I knew you well.",-1

After going to Disneyland for so many years it has all come down to GREED. Walt would never have stood for the prices they are now charging to get in the park or the cost of food or pins or t shirts. The Quality of the food vs Cost is just plain GREED. I have been in the park about 45 times in the last 57 years. I have 23 grand children and we will not be coming again. It is a shame that GREED took over the park. The cost of everything has just took the magic out of DISNEYLAND for this large family. We will look to other attractions where we can get a better value. Sorry you have done so much damage to a great place. $$$$$$$$$ GREED GREED GREED$$$$$$$$$$.,-1
"Went to Disney with very high expectations and it turned out to be one of our worst experiences ever.To start off just to buy the tickets it took us around close to one and a half hours.Later we saw that they had ticket counters near Disney Village and Walt Disney Studios park with absolutely no lines.They could have directed us to go to these other counters but oh! well we are in Paris no! so we had to get a taste of the rudeness.The wait time and lines to see each character was at least 60 minutes. They have a fast pass option but there was no one to tell us how to get the fast pass.When we found one that explained that we were already eligible for one,the people near the characters said they were done with fast pass for the day and wouldn't give no more.A little heads up at the ticketing counter would have taken care of this.We wanted to get on the train ride,the ushers there said that the train was not working & when we asked could they tell us when it would be functional they said they had no clue.Two hours later when we went back and asked them,they said the train rides for the day was done & it was just 4:45p:m and the train rides were supposed to end at 6p:m.They were endless queues everywhere.They totally suck at crowd management. Didn't think that Disney is so dysfunctional.All in all a terrible experience.Wasn't magical at all for my little boy who was crying when they said there were no train rides.Who cried again at not being able to meet the characters he really wanted to meet.Just wasted a lot of money and I will think a hundred times before I set foot on another Disney property.Seems like Disney is super confident that no matter what people will still go.But I am making sure that I will keep my family & friends away from this property.",-1
"The lines were ridiculous!!! 2 to 2 1 2 hours! We have loved Disneyland. I brought my daughter's for their 16th and 21st birthdays. For the average family it takes hard work to save the money to be able to go to Disneyland and to arrive and there be massive crowds and at least 14 ride closures plus many times having rides temporarily unavailable or go down after we waited in line for over an hour.... disappointing is an understatement. To also find out that there were some deep California resident discounts given that increased the crowds.... greedy! And to have bathrooms dirty and even the rides be untidy. Oh my goodness, and THEN... we ordered the mac n cheese at the Carnation restaurant and the only mac n cheese in the menu was $9, we were charged $20 each!!!! What on earth???",-1
"Been to Disney Orlando Florida multiple times, was well aware that Disney Paris would be smaller and that they only have the two parks so I thought I was going open minded, but Disney Paris needs to lock their doors close up shop. It is small with unhappy , unfriendly staff, we had five broken down rides and no one could tell us when they would be working. The park has large Disney posters everywhere but that attraction or restaurant is not there. This is not one of the happiest places in the world like Disney says. A parade that is maybe 8 minutes long Main Street is pathetic, save your time money.",-1
"This was the 4th time I have been to Disneyland and the least impressive. For a place that often has hot weather there isn't much shade and not many places to keep cool. We were there mid September in the middle of a heat wave. When you've forked out over $1000 dollars for your family to be there and have limited time you are going to go regardless. We had been to Disneyworld 4 years prior and even back then they had way more air conditioned places and water vapour sprayers to keep people cool in the long lines for rides. We thought we might try and beat the heat one morning and go to a magic morning. What a joke!! That just entitled us to either join a queue for Disneyland that extended right across to near the entrance to California Disney or queue up early for California Disney to open. We decided to join the shorter queue and stand in the sun for half an hour until they opened the gates to California Disney. Only to find when they opened the gates that didn't mean they were really letting you in early. They had roped off all the entrances to all the lands within the California park and didn't open them for another half hour. The happiest place on earth pretty quickly became miserable with a thousand people standing in the sun for another half hour with crying, whinging children wondering when they could get out of the sun and onto a ride. The only saving grace for Disneyland is the new Cars ride. Other than that if you have the choice between Disneyland and Disneyworld choose Disneyworld every day of the week. It's better run, not as tired, the staff are friendlier and happier and given that there are more worlds the queues are shorter.",-1
"We will be visiting Disneyland in December January for my husbands Big Birthday so I wanted to make it special by ordering him a cake to be sent to a restaurant. I called the (non 1 800 number on their website (714) 781 DINE) to order the cake. I spoke to a young guy and right from the get go he seemed dazed and confused about what should have been a simple transaction. It was about a 30 minute conversation to try to order a very simple cake. I had already waited on hold (long distance) for 45 mins to get through only to have more issues with order. He took all of my information including hotel, name, confirmation   AND my credit card information. He said he would then send me a confirmation email. Well I never did receive an email. I waited two weeks and called back. Same problem again, waited on hold for 30 minutes when finally someone picked up. I went through my whole issue with her and she seemed just as confused. She put me on hold about 6 times for minimum 5 6 minutes while she consulted with someone else. Finally she says there is no record of my order but she will follow through and speak to the hotel and bakery etc and call me back that same day. Surprise, NO call back. Who hires these people??? Why do they all seem to be brand new with no training?? Soooooo frustrating. So third time is the charm, NOT. I call back again today to try to track this order. I spoke to Anita today and the first thing she said was that they don't place orders for hotel delivery that I have to go through the hotel directly...What?? why didn't the first two reps tell me this?? Needless to say I have cancelled the order (that didn't seem to exist) and I will not be doing business with Disney dining anytime soon. I have booked a restaurant from their website but it wouldn't let me make changes to it, I had to call back again (no 1 800 ) to make a simple time change.You would think a company this big would have the best customer service in the world. They don't even have a  feedback  link on their website to email. They really need to go in and clean up their website and make it more user friendly (very confusing in some areas). Another simple solution to placing cake orders is to have an online link to do this yourself. Take out the agent all together then there is NO ROOM for error. COME ON DISNEYLAND, catch up with the times and get a website designer to fix these issues. And get a 1 800 number for your customers.",-1
"I am very disappointed that i have to write this complaint, but we were very unsatisfied with our stay at Santa Fe Hotel, Disneyland Paris from 6th November '09 to 8th Novemever '09. We went especially for our child's first birthday as we wanted it to be a special, magical day for him.  There were numerous issus that arose over our weekend at Disneyland Paris, and feel that these should be reported and followed up. As a customer and mother I do not agree how these issues could of occured on our visit and am disgusted that Disneyland Paris allow such rude and unfriendly attitudes towards their paying customers. Firstly, when we arrived we were given a room on the first floor of which there was no lift for us to take the pram up even though on our booking we had noted that we had a baby with us. We had to go back to reception and ask for a room on the ground floor. The next room we were given was right next to the main entrance into the building. The main entrance door to the block would not shut so a draft was coming underneath our door. We stopped the draft by putting towels down by the door. We had a baby in a cot which is close to the floor, having to put towels by the door to stop the draft is really not good enough. When initially checking in, we were asked a time we would like to have breakfast. We asked if we had to chose a time as with a baby we are never on time and didnt want to rush. We were told that we had to chose a time, so we did. The next morning we frantically rushed to get ready for our allocated breakfast time, only to find ourselves waiting in a long queue. At first we thought the queue was for our table and waited patiently. As we had to rush to make it down on time, our baby was still in his night clothes. We then realised the majority of people in the queue did not have their ticket with an allocated time on, and the Disneyland Staff were just letting them in for breakfast with no priority for the people queuing with a ticket. When we finally found a table we found it to be dirty, the milk machine was out of milk, there were only broken bits of bread in the bread basket and there were no glasses to get juice. This is unacceptable. We are trying to get our child used to a feeding time. We had to break our schedule to fit in with the Santa Fe rules, only to find out nobody was sticking to the rules anyway.All this time was wasted which we could have spent in the park. Our friends then went back to the room to get a shower while we finished eating and feeding our baby. On return to the room, they found the new key they were given didn't work, so they had to go back to reception to fix this problem. Once again, more time that was lost that could have been spent in the park. They had to queue for a considerable amount of time to get to the reception desk, only to then speak to an incredibly rude and ignorant manager. Our friends explained the problem about the key to him, and expressed that they were disappointed about loosing time in the park as they also had to queue for breakfast when other people were allowed to push in etc. The manager replied that there were problems at Santa Fe with regards to the breakfast, but they had tried numerous other ways of doing it and the way they were currently using worked best. He then went on to add that he had been to many other hotels throughout the world and that they all have problems. Our friends said that they were also frequent travellers and had not seen breakfast in such shambles as that! The manager went on to argue with our friends that he had been to more countries and and stayed in more hotels than they had!! We find this to be completely unprofessional. The manager tried to resolve the problem by promising that he would come back to the room and fix the key. He never did. The rest of our 2 day stay we had to share the key which was completely unreasonable.  When we finally got to the park we were having a lovely time until.. We had booked the 'Birthday Meet and Great' in the Lucky Nugget for our son's first birthday. Again, we wanted his day to be extra special and one to remember for all of us. I phoned twice and both times when I reseved a place I was asked for his age and name. Once again, we had to wait a considerable amount of time to even be let into the Lucky Nugget, in which time other guests had started gathering outside. When the doors eventually opened, we found the other guests to push in and bombard other guests. With regards to Health and Safety, this is a very dangerous situation.  When we arrived we were seated at a table and then we went to change our son's nappy. When we came back, the staff were handing out the birthday cakes. We found the waiters to be very rude. They literally plonked the cake down in front of us. Nobody said happy birthday to him. A card was also placed on the table which was blank. It didn't even his name writen on it.  Goofy, Pluto, Tigger and Tac came round to meet our son, of which he loved. Then we spotted Mickey, but he was going round every table so we thought he would come to us last as we were situated near the end. When Mickey finally got to the tables near us, we assumed he would then come to us. To our dismay we relised he was about to leave, so my partner went over to him and kindly asked if he could you come over to say happy birthday to our son and sign his card. Mickey's helper then very rudely and abruptly replied  no, we are going he has no more time . We were so incredibly disappointed and upset by this. Our son has a Disneyland Paris autograph book with pictures of him with everyone except Mickey. Later, the staff then brought around the surprise for the the birthday boy girl and missed our table, so I went to the bar and asked if our son could have his surprise. A staff member called Aissa then went to get one and gave it to our son. We quickly realised the surprise was not suitable for under 3's, so we asked them if he could have a different surprise suitable for his age group. Aissa then went to find another product and once again came back with another surprise that was not suitable for under 3's. Aissa told us they didn't have anything for under 3's which I found funny as we were in Disney which is aimed at children, and we had seen things suitable for his age group around the park. We found the lady we spoke to very abbupt and her attitude towards us appalling. I was concerned my son would pick up on her negative approach as they pick things up so quickly at his age. I informed her that we had paid for him to have a birthday cake, meet the characters and receive a birthday surprise and that he had not recieved his surprise. She rudely replied 'You didn't pay for him'. We had to pay 19 euros a head for the adults. What right does she have to talk to paying customer like that? She then tried to get around the situation by telling us the surprise was not included in the price, and then told us that he could have the surprise that was not suitable for under 3's for him. Items have warnings printed on them for a reason. If our son had choked on the gift that Disneyland Paris gave him that was not suitable for his age group, imagine the public interest and what would be printed in the newspapers. Luckily we did notice, but if Disneyland Paris is going around giving presents to other children and the parents are not so alert to this, it's an accident waiting to happen. I told her that I would like to speak to a manager about these issues, only to be told there were no mangers on site. Once again, if something was to happen in the Lucky Nugget and there was no manager around to handle the situation, imagine the interest of the public and newspapers. Something else waiting to happen really!Finally a supervisor came and spoke to us. He was very pleasant and understanding of our issues raised to him. He also told us that we could complain near the entance of the park and explained that he could not do much more than which we found to be resonable. So, why couldn't Aissa who gave him the unsuitable toy, or the manager at Santa Fe handled it the same? Why did they have an abusive, threatening and uncaring attitude towards us? We're paying customers, wanting a fantastic birthday for our son. We found the staff to be unreasonable with us and make our time at Disneyland Paris uncomfortable and stressful. So much time was wasted going back and forth which could have been spent in the park. We're disgusted that Disneyland Paris employ people with such poor customer service and unacceptable approach to customers to work around children and deal with children and families everyday on their special occasions. The time for his birthday party was runined and we payed 19euros a head *4 to be argueing a fair point with a staff member that was so unreasonable and rude which i feel is totaly wrong. We paid   636 for 2 nights in a draughty room which was not suitable for a child to sleep in a cot low to the floor. When we complained at City Hall the staff were very helpful, understanding and friendly. They totaly understood our point that we could not give this toy to our son and kindly gave him teddy which was very kind. Why couldn't that have been done earlier at the Lucky Nugget? They were also very sympathetic about our troubles at Santa Fe. They informed us to write to Disneyland Paris as this is not acceptable behaviour for staff at Disney. We are so angry and upset to think we paid all that money for our son's birthday and ended up treated in such a poor manner. Disneyland Paris is meant to be a family park and we didn't expect such low standards, rudeness and aggressiveness.  So, that was his first birthday. It was meant to be incredibly special. Instead, it was an incredible let down.",-1

"We are... were as of tomorrow 5 year annual pass holders who travel... traveled at least 2054 round trip 5 or more times a year to visit Disneyland. Yes, you could say we were dedicated and probably a few other descriptive words... So it would take quite a bit to convince this duo and often double duo to say,  Ya, I don't think I want to do that again...  We have easily spent close to 100k there in the last 5 years... And although I'm not experienced, make no claim to be experienced, and don't currently have any Disneyland stock, I would be selling it now if I did.Oh, this last trip... where to even begin... First off Cars Land is good. Not great. Not comparable to Indiana Jones, but it is not 8 hours of wait time good with 2 successful rides during off season. It can't carry Disneyland like they think it can. People aren't getting off this ride like,  Wow! Amazing!  which you hear and see on so many other rides... Although we pretty much expected this.What we didn't expect was the other changes... Almost all the rides went down several times over the 6 days we were there. We'd stand in line, the be sent away. Go stand in another line and be sent away... People just weren't walking around with that same  Yeah, I'm in Disneyland!  look either. I could see the same opinion on most of the crowds face... It saddened me.And the food... It's not the same. I don't just mean the menus because they've changed since June, but the quality. We were ready to order Domino's to our room by day 5... The personnel... Not all the Cast Members by no means! But not just one bad apple either... Clearly there's some problems there in Anaheim and it's showing in how the employees are handling their jobs. Not to mention our new little Cast Member featured in the picture attached... It's a coach roach for those of you like myself are seeing one for the first time, just out side of Thunder Mountain...Somethings got to give. I believe (AGAIN NOT AN EXPERT!!) that Disneyland can ride out this one bad year, but I'm afraid if they don't get it figured out they'll not have the same needed numbers of returning visitors and Southern CA just can't support this park on their own. I really hope they pull this one out. I don't think it's Walt's vision...Respectfully, Once one of Disneyland Biggest Fans...",-1
We took our 4 year old and 8 month old to Disneyland Paris at the beginning of July. We expected magic. We didn't get it! We had to wait 40 minutes to check in at the hotel when there were 3 staff on check in and 2 people in front of us is the queue. This was because the check in staff were trying to sell anything and everything.We stayed in the Santa Fe. I have stayed in better Premier Inns. There was no kettle in the room and no cot as requested. I had to telephone reception twice to get these sent to the room and had to wait an hour by which time my 8 month old had fallen asleep on the floor. We had to pay    10 for tea and coffee sachets!The staff at the hotel were a miserable bunch and customer service was definitely not a priority. The childrens indoor play area in the hotel was a glorified cupboard with a small table and chair and was only open when the restaurant was open. The shuttle bus didn't run every 10 minutes and when it arrived everyone pushed and shoved to get on. My son was pushed off the bus at one point and people were stepping over the buggy to get on. The queues inside the parks were ridiculous with some rides having a wait time of over an hour. Queue barging is the norm which we found really irritating. There were no characters walking about and no staff anywhere to offer assistance. The shops all sell the same merchandise and it is all over priced and nothing special.    60 for a fancy dress costume!The food in the restaurants was poor quality and mass produced. The best place we found to eat was The Earl of Sandwich in Disney Village. The rides aren't anything to get too excited about and 3 broke down while we were there. We found that nothing was easy in Disneyland and none of the staff were interested in helping. We had access to the Disneyland Park from 8am as we were staying in the hotel but only a few rides were actually open and we couldn't get into the studio park until 10 when the general public were let in.I would advise anyone thinking about going to disneyland paris to save up and go to Disney in Florida or California. That's what we will be doing. Disneyland Paris really gives Disney a bad name. We won't be going back.,-1
"We have just returned from a visit to Disneyland Paris and having visited both LA and Orlando on numerous occasions we are surprised that these parks in Paris have the Disney name.To say that we felt  ripped off  is an understatement. Two cheeseburgers, small frites and med cola, 6 chicken nuggets meal and kids meal nearly   70.This was not a character restaurant   my grand daughter (20) and her god daughter (5)went to the Princess meal and that cost them   85!!! We had researched that before going but decided that was a meal not to be missed hence why !only one adult accompaned the child.A small box of popcorn was nearly   5 't get I won't go on but after paying for the entry tickets dont get ripped off for food and drink   a small bottle of water was   3.50.",-1
"Too Crowded, too pricey, and has lost it's charm. Disneyland of the 50's 60's 70's and 80's was a wonderful place to visit. It has lost all charm. If you enjoy standing line line at the DMV you will love this place. Everything has a price tag on it and now all the rides exit to their overpriced gift shops. I'll bet Walt is just rolling over in his grave.",-1
"We were looking forward to our visit to Disneyland. We were highly disappointed. Complete waste of money. Disneyland is nothing like Disney world. We knew it wouldn   t be the same; but we were at least hoping to feel the same magic. We did not. We did not see any characters the whole time we were there. The only thing this park cares about is selling it   s merchandise. Whether it be disney or Star Wars merchandise, it was being pandered everywhere. The park is overcrowded. Ride lines are outrageous. Even with maxpass you wait over two hours. The Pixar parade was a joke. Only 20 minutes long. Food prices are through the roof. Never again will we visit a Disney resort or property. Time to move on to universal studios. ",-1
A two day pass with lunches for a family of four set us back over $800.00. Wait times for the more popular rides was about 45 minutes. Way too crowded and over priced to warrant a return trip.,-1
"Stayed here in March 2017. It was our 8th, and last time. Yet again, a handful of the better rides were closed. The one that were open kept breaking down( Big thunder mountain was closed more than it was open). No apologies from these people. Even the fast pass ticket machines were occasionally closed. The fast food restaraunts have become really expensive. 14.99 Euros for a burger and chips! It's not the place it was ten years ago. If the entire park isn't open they shopud reflect this in their prices.",-1
"so crowded, people were rude and crossing in front, no manners way to crowded, couldn't move without being ran over or running someone over.",-1
"This place is simply way too over rated. Avoid it like plague on a weekend or on a holiday. Long ques for rides , food and even for clicking a pic. Food is overpriced and not worth it.",-1
"corn dogs are 6.19, souvenire cups are 12.99. The people working at Disneyland seem to be very unhappy people that don't like children.  Their short with you and the food is more like carnival food",-1
"Weekend queues can go as long as 120min, believe it or not. Fast pass need to wait for 5h! With so many people and some sitting on the floor at casey corner to eat their hotdogs for dinner, you can find their restaurant Pizzeria Bella Notte closing at 6.30pm.! What lousy service. We understand the park is supposed to be magical at night but when night falls, the place was not well lit and pose risks for children, elderly and the disabled. The parades had shorter duration compared to other disney parks and totally underwhelming.Paid one of the most expensive disney tickets,   69 per person, but did not get the value. Tokyo disney was much cheaper but so much better in terms of service and experience.Would not return again.",-1
"What a waste of time, effort and money. Awful food that we had to wait too long to get and rides, whilst fun, took way to long to queue for. Disneyland your fast pass system is awful! Never going back there again...",-1
"What a shame. Plan for a vacation and spent one hour....Just in line to get into the park. No staff giving directions or info. About 3 4 lines that went all the way out to the street. We   re talking about 2 3 blocks. But, if you do not have anything with you, and they mean nothing. Small bag, not even a large wallet, then you go to a smaller line. I have never seen such lines anywhere, park, attractions or stadiums. Getting cheap on security, guess they do not want to spend money on staff. Save yourself from waisting your morning. Never come early on busy days!!!!!!",-1
"We have visited Disneyland Paris 4 times in the last few years and this is the worst it has ever been. The park looks very worn out and the rides keep breaking down. We had 6 stops on one ride alone for  technical problems . The new attractions were having  technical problems  most days. We were there for 5 days and there were rides not working on all the days in both parks. We were not able to get on the Crusher ride, my sons favourite, as this broke down at least three times a day! He was very upset as we could not ride this as the queues when it did work were 90 mins long. The parades were non existent, there used to be 3 parades a day and lots of Christmas cheer, now you get 1 in each park and only 6 floats! The dancers were a troop but now you get a couple dancing only! The Christmas decorations were sparse to say the least; the lack of Disney characters was very noticeable as they only came out for the photo shoots etc but no interaction or fun. The costs have grown and you should expect to pay top prices for the cheapest quality. Restaurants in the village as well as the park are not delivering any service and the cost of a family of 4 with a 2 course meal will set you back 120 Euros. The staffs looked unhappy and have no Christmas additions to their uniforms, no Santa hats or tinsel or any reference to Christmas at all! If your looking for a bit a sparkle and fun before Christmas give Disneyland Paris a miss.",-1
Long Queue's for rides which I can except but the 1hr queue for  Fast Food  not expectable. The theme seemed to be not enough staff of concession stands. Even when we ate at the more up market restaurants (California grill and Chez Remy) we still had a good half hour wait from being seated despite having a reservation and eating the fixed menu at the California grill. For a fine dining experience not good enough in my view. ,-1
"Been living in HK for the past 10 years and was looking forward to visiting Disneyland in 2006 when it was opened, what a disappointment!!! Nothing comparable to other Disneylands (France, USA...etc) in terms of size, entertainment, attractions, price, space, crowd etc...  Bonded with tourists...More",-1
"We^re a family of 2 adults and 2 kids. We booked a 2 parks 2 days arrangement, which is astronomically expensive, compared to other parks like Europapark in Rust, Germany, or Efteling park in the Netherlands. It was not our first time in Disneyland Paris, we've been at least 3 times before. But I must say that the last trip was for sure the last one for a long time. We felt ripped off in every way: at every attraction there were queues of 45 minutes at least, up to 120 minutes. In two days we were just able to make 9 rides in total. Many of them had constantly technical issues, and were down, so we couln't even use our fastpass (happened twice to us, plus another time we waited nearly an hour at Big Thunder Mountain, then it closed due to technical issues, right before we could ride). Another fastpass ticket went bust because we spent 110 minutes in a queue which was supposed to last  only  70 minutes. So if you like to spend your time standing in the cold, with some drizzling rain, with children who are very disappointed because they can't go on any ride, with completely overprized and overcrowded restaurants, then Disneyland is for you at Christmas time! To be fair, I have to say that the Xmas decorations were even more beautiful this year than the year before, but that didn't compensate our total frustration. We all actually regretted having gone there, and if we ever go again in an attraction park around Xmas, it will be either Europapark or Efteling, both less than half price of the Disney rip off.",-1
"Went to Disneyland over Spring Break 2015 with three grandchildren (ages 8 and twins age 2). $500 for 3 rides and lunch! Never, never again! The wait times were ridiculous! In the 70's and 80's, we went with our children to Disney World in Florida    we got  tickets  (the old system) and the days were always enjoyable for them! Crowds are okay    the wait times are not! Disney needs to come up with a better system! What a waste of time and money!",-1
"we have been here a number of times over the years that it has been open so we are not fazed by the high prices in the park or the number of staff that are so rude they should be sacked on the spot but this time I'm so sad to see the state of the park, the maintenance of the buildings, the walkways and the little things that make Disney so magical for the whole family has gone to pot, Walt Disney would shut this place down in a heartbeat if he saw it there are patches of concrete all over the park different colours from the rest of the ground, the building and flooring are cracked and crumbling and rubbish strewn all over the place, even waiting for the rides people are smoking at the gates and the staff just don't care.",-1
The area is very small. I can say smallest disneyland. We can finish all park within half a day. There are not many rides and no ride for mature!,-1
"We went to DLP on 21st Oct, staying at the Santa Fe Hotel. The hotel was lovely, no complaints! We were in the Disney Park for 8am which was worth it. The rides were good, the kids loved Buzz Lightyear. We took some snacks with us, which saved some money. We ate at Cafe Mickey, the food is discusting! lots of characters which was the only good thing. Rainforest cafe was better and the Lucky nugget saloon was ok but nothing great. Bad service in this one, waited 20mins to pay. They rush you then your left standing and waiting for ages. Buffalo Bills is worth it! Was great, we really got involved and was fun! The people are pushy and rude, pushing my 5 year old. I'd had enough after 2 days! Was a good time but we wouldnt go back there again!Everything expensive, but i knew what to expect. We travelled on eurostar which is great, Disney Express works very well too. The longest queue was about 30mins for Nemo and Peter Pan. but usually the queus go quite quick and we were usually only waiting for 5 10 mins. I wouldnt recommend going on a Saturday, it got extremely busy on this day. When it rains it rains! Head for the studios for more shelter! Stitch Live was worth seeing too. Be very careful, when its wet everywhere is very slippery, lots of people falling over! No one queues for anything, so in the end we stopped queueing too. They shove you in the lines, i ended up barging them back just to make them stop. Even with me being pregnant they do not care! Take rainjackets you WILL need them! If travelling on Eurostar you can take as much luggage as you want. We bought back lots of presents even a huge globe in a box and it was fine. there is an Esso garage outside near the Santa Fe but we didnt go there. The shuttle buses were fine for us, no pushing. Get breakfast before 8am, after this its really busy!",-1
I understand the time we visited is busy period but staff are soooo slow. We visit Florida every year and staff are quick and efficient. Saw lots of empty seats for rides with a 120 minute queue! Food is not great in the parks and expensive. Again slow and massive queues. People walk everywhere smoking! No designated smoking area. I find this a big problem. People blowing smoke into mine and my son's face non stop. Lots of rides out of order or breaking down after queuing for 60 mins to be told leave (no fast pass issues to come back) Just lacking the disney magic you find at Disney world. ,-1
"Although I read the reviews prior to going, I still wasn't expecting the park to be that small. The first disappointment was the 'fake' train station building. It looked like a backdrop from a cheap play made out of canvas. Main Street was less than 5th of the length than it's counterparts, and castle (although surrounding by hoarding), looked no higher than your tallest basketball player! Many of the food establishments were closed, although what i eat eat was very good. Been to many Disney Parks, and this was by far the worst...really not worth they money they're asking for.",-1
"Are you kidding me?! That is what the sign said on Wednesday, January 4, 2017. It was CRAZY CROWDED! Don't get me wrong, I LOVE Disneyland but this was insane! When I lived in Southern California, I had an annual pass. We would go on off days to avoid the crowds. We came down on off days and rainy days, hoping that it would keep the crowds low. I guess everyone had the same idea! This year our kids had a weird Holiday schedule. So I thought it would be fun to make a quick trip to Disneyland. It was so crowded that it made it hard to have fun. We got in right as it opened and got our first fast pass and then went to ride Indiana Jones. After waiting for 20 minutes in line, they closed the ride. They should offer return tickets for those that had waited in line. It was so crowded that there were horrible lines to use the rest rooms and then you had to wait in line to wash your hands! I've never been to Disneyland where the bathrooms were so poorly maintained. They were dirty! I've never seen this before at this park. Stalls had no toilet paper and there were no paper towels. I even informed a a cast member of the problem and they shrugged their shoulders at me. I'd have to say the most annoying part of this visit was the LINE CUTTING! When did this become acceptable? Everyone was doing it. Old people, young people, little kids, and parents were all cutting in line. You get in line and wait like everyone else has had to do. You should not be able to play, eat, use the restroom, whatever and then when your party is at the front, you push your way up to them!!! NO! NO! NO! Also, people walking in the crowded park texting or using their smart phones and not paying attention to where they are walking. I lost count of how many times I got slammed into by people not paying attention. Play your games, text, read your email or what ever while in line, not while walking. I could go on but you understand. I Love Disneyland and will continue to visit but I think that they need to rethink some of their policies.",-1
The park really disappointed me! all the rides are for little kids and not for adults at all. we actually upgraded the 97$ tickets (a person) and went to the other park adventure (it costs us 50$ a person). The parade was great and there wasn't light pardae show.The queue line is busy we waited 80 minutes ! to 1 ride,-1
"My husband, daughter aged 10 and I have just returned from Disneyland Paris. We stayed at Hotel New York from 12 15th inclusive. Drive down from Calais not bad   this was our fourth visit. Checked in quickly at Hotel but disappointed to find no kettle in room and very surly cleaners on arrival at our room door. A great Disney welcome (not!). Unfortunately it was English half term and French school holidays and the park was very busy. Weather was attrocious and we had nowhere to get wet clothes dry easily. Queues to see the characters were long, we gave up half the time. Food was ridiculously expensive. We went to Planet Hollywood for Valentines Lunch and the in house photographer would not take no for an answer until I exploded. Went for coffee, and deli sandwiches one night cost 20 euros. Gave up after that and went to McDonalds. We found the French were given preferential treatment for everything. Queues everywhere all the time through security, for meals, characters. Having said that the new Buzz ride is great and the Stunt Show remains a favourite.However we will not return. Journey back home took 1 hour longer due to accident just on Paris outskirts. Save your money for Florida   we are going to and we are sure the food will be cheaper and the American people so much more warm and welcoming.",-1
"This is our 3rd visit to the park and it will be our lastThe place is a shambles and a VERY expensive one at 550 euros for 4 of us for 2 daysFor that I expect ALL the rides working. Queued 3 times for Thunder Mountain only to be told it was again out of order. Refurbing Its a Small world...why in peak season?Queued for 70 mins for Crushems coaster to be told when we were next on that it had broken down! We refused to leave and got on 20 mins later when fixed. The back scenes tour broke down twice while we were doing the tourThe whole place needs looking at as the money generated on entrance, the extortionate food and merchandise needs investing in the park. This is not the Disney experience that has been portrayed for years but an expensive money making excuseThe queues are ridiculous and so why shut the fast track in the afternoon when the park is open until 11pmI really wouldn't waste your money and holiday on this and have vowed never to return........which is a great shame!",-1
"My family visited Disneyland Paris last week. Because we are all Disney fans, I am trying to find something good to say about it. Ummm...Tower of Terror is great!That's about it!First the service. One member of our party is over 60, after we paid admission we found out that he was entitled to a 35% senior discount. We tried to get our refund no joy. They told us we should have told them his age when we bought the ticket, but there is NO WHERE around the ticket area that announces the discount.Second the prices. A 2 park one day pass is 79 euros (about 90 U.S) which is more than a park hopper at WDW with 4 parks included and a lot more attractions in the U.S., Paris is missing some of the best rides. We knew that going in and decided to go anyway. We made the mistake of not bringing water an lunch to the park. The prices at any theme park are outrageous, but Disney Paris is looking to break records! A 2 ounce bag of chips was 4 euros! A bottle of water was 8. Absolutely horrible. We cancelled our dinner reservations in the park because of the prices and went back to Paris to eat, missing the nighttime show simply because inner was more ridiculously price than any 5 star restaurant in Paris!The crowds were awful. Disney in the states will shut the gates if it gets that full. No less than a 90 minute line anywhere. No crowd control at all! Pickpockets were in force as well, there is no security and we saw several people upset because they had been victimized.Anyone who is used to Disney in the U.S., needs to eware rides are NOT the same! Indiana Jones and Space Mountain have loops that go upside down. I am not a person who can handle upside down, and I expected the same rides. I was not prepared for the loops and became ill on IndianaJones. I asked first before Space Mountain and abstained. What a disappointment! There should be enough information in the guide to forewarn guests. I would never go back to Disney Paris!!",-1
Our visit was for 3 full days and out of the 3 one of them was spent queuing. Very badly organised for such a commercial organisation. On 4 occasions we were turned away from a ride as it was broken down. Food costs are extortionate and very little other choice than burgers and fries if you choose to eat in the park which are still vastly overpriced.,-1
"The French, with their well earned criticism for being rude, arrogant and unhelpfull, were to me, always unhappy bedfellows with Disney, a charming, warm, welcoming and entertaining company. While I am no expert on Disney Parks, I have been to the one's in the U.S.A. and there is simply no comparison. ",-1
4 hours 4 rides. Ridiculous waiting times and very hot some places sat 15 minutes wait but are more likely to be 45 minutes. Everything was severely overpriced and the staff are rede and ignorant. Kids were over it after 4 hours and didn't like it and don't want to return. ,-1
"Going at peak season is probably just asking for trouble. And that's what we did. Hauling four kids around Disneyland in peak season is worse than Survivor. Manners in this part of the world are in very short supply, there are tonnes of people, and you can expect to be frequently jostled, pushed and have your three year old ripped from your arm by some impatient European teenager wanting to get one metre ahead of you on the escalator.The queues were unbelievable    50 90 minutes, for rides that last only minutes.We watched a couple of movies    Captain Eo and the Armaggedon one    but be warned you have to sit through a 10 minute video which is basically a long advertisement (in the case of Captain Eo it was for Kodak). Really? haven't we paid enough to get in    do we need to be forced to watch advertising? I turned around during these to see if anyone was watching and absolutely no one was! But you have to stand during these ads, and it is mega infuriating.The icing on the cake was at the Videopolis arcade games    my children had been queuing at the air hockey table for a game and when it was finally their turn, two adults leapt from their game and quickly seized the air hockey game so that my children couldn't have a turn. When my husband pointed out that our kids had been waiting, the woman haughtily replied that they were only playing that game while waiting for the air hockey to finish. They then proceeded to have game after game (continually inserting coins so that the kids couldn't have a go) and when i politely asked them how much longer they were going to be the woman simply shrugged and said 'i don't know, i don't know). No staff to help in any of these areas    the one from the eatery told me to go find a shop to get this woman off and allow my kids to have a game. A shop? which one? He just shrugged and i gave up. Charming. Bathroom facilities are very dirty but the baby rooms seem to be ok (there aren't many). But be warned, you aren't allowed to take a pram into the baby changing facilities (!!) so if you are going in by yourself with more than one small child, be prepared. Actually just don't. Go with two people because no matter how much pleading you undertake, you won't be allowed to take that pram in. Cos the staff are young students, with no influence and no ability to be flexible when conditions call for it. They are only there for a few months at a time, and they just do what they are told.The staff are taught to have what staffer described to me as 'American manners'. That is, no matter how rude people are to you, you just smile and say 'have a nice day'. And people are rude to them, unbelievably so. I've never heard people be as rude and demanding as i did at Disneyland. All around horrible. The attractions on the Gold Coast in Australia are much better, and the atmosphere is a lot less combative.",-1
More than 15 rides are closed and the park over sells the entry tickets way more than its capacity to handle. No one inside to help or guide you. Huge queue for certain rides having wait time of more than two hours.,-1
"The Disneyland Paris Park is small, which can be seen as a bit of a bonus, and has a lot of the main attractions that anyone would want to go to Disneyland for. Many of these attractions have either an EU or a French twist, adding a bit of character to the park. There are, however, less shows and experiences than either Disneyland or Walt Disney World. This means that if you are not into the ride experience there is less for you to do. There are also very few rides that pregnant women can go on (not normally a problem, but this time it was an issue).The big drawback with this park is the guests smoking. I wasn't able to go on Pirates of the Caribbean and was pointed towards a waiting area. This should have been a nice area to sit and wait for your party but the benches there were taken up with people so desperate for a cigarette that they lit up as they walked out of the ride. If this wasn't disgusting enough, the  cast members  (a term I use very loosely here) ignore individuals who smoke, walking past people smoking in the middle of Main Street or outside of the rides rather than in the designated smoking areas. Indeed the one place where I didn't see anyone smoking was in the designated smoking areas.The lack of management maintenance of the Disney standard means that I can only suggest that you visit this park if you are a smoker. Otherwise, don't bother!",-1
"We had a very disappointing experience at Disneyland. My husband needs an ECV because of heath issues, he cannot walk for long periods at a time. Where you have to rent them is a long walk from where you get off the tram. We get inside and there are strollers everywhere. It is so hard to maneuver around them and if you need to park your ECV.... good luck.....I asked one employee where to park it at the Peter Pan ride and he says  It is a 45 minute wait for the ride.  What?!?!?! I told him... I am aware of that, we are willing to wait, where can my husband park his ECV? He says by the stroller parking. Thankfully, he did find a place. We ate in the French Market area for supper and the whole place was messy. The tables were dirty and ground covered with powdered sugar and trash, while about a dozen people working there had ample time to talk and laugh with each other instead of cleaning up the area. The Jungle Ride was a disaster....we waited for 45 minutes to ride and then the employee goes so fast during the ride, you didn't have time to look at anything. People were trying to take pictures and finally gave up. Then when the ride is over, we have to wait to get off because the boats are backed up! Hey... why don't you go slower during the ride that we waited so long for???? We have been to Disneyworld and it is a much better experience. I was expecting the same from Disneyland and we were left disappointed in our experience. We were thinking about going to Disney's California Adventure, but because of our experience here, we didn't want to waste more money by having a bad experience. I have always wanted to come to Disneyland and can say that I have been here, but not worth the money to come back.",-1
We have been to Disneyland many times and never had a problem until this trip. I have Rheumatoid arthritis and while I may look  normal  it is very difficult to stand for any period of time. I guess they have a new policy where you have to convince the person that you have a disability. I guess she felt that I wasn't disabled enough as she said that if I was unwilling to have my husband push me around in a wheelchair I was going to have a difficult time. Well she was right I had a difficult time and ended up leaving hours early. Good thing my children are old enough to stay themselves otherwise the whole family would have been disappointed. We will be spending our money on other vacations as this will be our last trip to Disneyland.,-1
"I am an avid Disney fan. I live in Texas but have been an annual passholder off and on for the past 17 years. It gets more expensive and more crowded every year. This visit, I had a bad experience that has left a bad taste in my mouth and I am disappointed with the way Disney is handled a problem that I had. As most families do when they arrive at Disneyland, they stop to take a photo in front of the flowers at the entrance. We pre paid for our Disney Photo Pass so we wanted to take advantage of it. We stopped for several minutes to do some photos and there were 2 photographers there so we were able to take some pictures with our camera as well as his. When we walked off, my daughter left her sunglasses on the brick wall and realized it a couple of minutes later as we walked in front of City Hall. She ran back to the Photo Pass Photographers who had just took our pictures and asked if they had seen her prescription sunglasses and the Photo Pass Photographer told us that the photographer who took our pictures had the glasses and was taking them to lost and found!!! In the mean time, I had gone straight to Lost and Found to file a report. As with all things Disney, I had to stand in line for 45 minutes. Once I gave the report, the girl said that the photographer had not turned them in yet but for us to check back that evening or the next day. I called every day and that photographer never turned them in or the system at the Lost and Found is bad. These are $400, Kate Spade prescription sunglasses!! Sadly, sunglasses aren't covered on insurance and she had these glasses for one week. I don't know what to do. Lost and Found is no help. They said that they get hundreds of glasses per day and throw them away after 2 weeks. I have called almost every day for 2 weeks and they say that they don't have them. What happened to them???This visit was overall disappointing at Disneyland. We were disappointed with the crowds and the Grad Night craziness all day throughout the park. We were there 9 days and never got to see the fireworks. Three of the days were canceled due to high winds. The other days were so crowded that they felt dangerous. Once the parade is over the entire park crams into Main Street to watch the projections and the fireworks. This must be some sort of safety hazard. If there was a fire or something else happened, that people had to make a fast exit, there would be people who are trampled. Not to mention, people have to get a spot at least 4 hours before to get a place and then when the parade is over...all hell breaks loose and every man is for themselves. Not happy with this! ",-1
"My overall experience would have been a great one if it hadn't been for the new ticket entrance process at Disneyland. Each line has two customer reps   one takes a picture of you and the other checks for the validate date. While my family was waiting in line for a magic morning, the person in front of us had mistakenly taken another family member's ticket and the line was held up. After 10 minutes, I asked if my family could get through at the next line but the rep said she already verified our pictures so we had to stay in the current line. Another 5 minutes passed and the people behind us also started complaining and walking to other lines so my family followed. Once I got into the park, I went to guest services and complained that half of our magic morning was ruined with this poorly executed process and bad customer services. Oh, did I mention that the device that Disney uses for picture validation is slow and it takes about twice the time to get into a park? Also, it is not fun at all if you have a park hopper ticket and have to go through the same ticket validation with each re entrance.",-1
"Our family, my wife and three children visited over New Year . It was our second visit, the first 8 years ago which was poor but either we had memoried like goldfish or hoped that it was a one off bad experience. It was not!There was one redeeming feature, the New Year dinner in our hotel was wonderful although very expensive. Other than that it was atrocious. The concierge was a joke, rude and unhelpful, my wife who was in a wheel chair was treated like a pariah, the attraction and in particular the rationed tickets for wheelchair users meant that a 30 minute queue for the public was a three hour queue for her because of the wheelchair. People rude, food poor, so poor that two of our family were sick after eating a    150 meal of disgusting filth in the pirates of the caribbean themed restaurant. Even the waiter sympathised, he was embarrassed.We have visited Disney Fl which is fantastic, this is as poor as it gets folks, don't bother, pay the airfare and go to FL",-1
"due to traffic, we didnt arrive until 4 but still had to pay the full price ($87 PER person). The place was a zoo, even on a non holiday weekday. 30 40 minute waits were standard.Your entertainment dollars are better spent elsewhere. If you have kids obsessed with princesses, get there early and get it done in a day",-1
"Unfortunately, this is not what it seems. Don't waste your money. Instead get the free Fast Pass for whatever time the show is that you want to watch and purchase your dinner where every you would like to eat.My family recently went on a trip to Disneyland and purchased the On the go dinning package, with the expectation that we would be  guaranteed  better viewing spot than the people who simply get the fast pass. NOT THE CASE. We arrived 30 minutes prior to the show and we were literally stuck behind a tree with all the people who got normal fast passes and didn't pay for the dinner experience. Not to mention the fact that the food was sub par. The lasagna was rubbery and the chicken was dry. You were given only 3 options and you're forced to have to pick a time that is well before the actual show time. We had a 9pm show and we had to eat our food at 2:30pm.When I addressed this matter with the  leads  they were NOT helpful nor was the manager at  City Hall  on Main Street either. I was ignored and told I would be helped and the person never came back and then when we went to main street  City Hall  the manager Ricardo was not helpful and extremely rude.From what I could see the show seemed very enjoyable but I was beyond upset that I paid for this experience and was told that I was paying for the food. NOT the case I was paying for my food and my tickets. It seems like it would be worth it if you had better spot to sit but there is no guarantee that you will see anything.AGAIN I STRESS DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!! NOT WORTH IT AT ALL!!!!",-1
"I have just returned from a two day visit to disneyland paris and all I can say is what a disappointment. Firstly, you could be in any theme park in Europe and it is only occasionally that you are reminded that this is Disneyland Pairs. There were no characters walking around the park and it does not have that magical Disney feel. The staff were unhelpful, unfriendly and uninterested. There was no interaction with the children and it seems they were just there for the money. They were quiet often rude or would just choose to ignore you.We were also disappointed with the number of rides shows that were either not working or cancelled. To name a few, indian jones ride closed, Pirates of the caribbean ride closed, thunder mountain closed, Rock'n'roller Coaster closed, car parade was cancelled as was the stun show.Also, to buy anything in the park was expensive, a bottle of water was 3.09 euro so i would advise taking your own food and water. I will not be visiting Disneyland Paris again and will advise family and friend to avoid or go to florida!",-1
"I realize that most people won't care about this review as the magical mystery created from youth will still lead you to go here and by no means do we want you not to go, but a good dose of reality needs to be taken prior and during your visit.While many Disney staff eagerly want your visit to be joyful and memorable, the greed of management has put many responsible for line management woefully unprepared. Fast passes cost money, especially when you purchase the on line app version to make it easier to get around the park and to manage when and where you want to go. We arrived at the park at 9am with a six year old and we knew that you really only get one good hour per year your kid is   giving us 6 hours at the park before she melts. This was our last day of a very expensive investment in Disney (we are Vacation members as well) and we were only able to get a fast pass for the Haunted Mansion for 5:40pm. It was going to be a long day   but she really wanted to go. We stayed at the park all day and when we finally got to the Mansion, we told the staff person we were here for our fast pass and he pointed to a very long line. We said, 'no' we have a fast pass for this attraction and he said   yes   that is the line. There must have been 1000 people in line and when I asked in disbelief how that could be for the fast pass   he said    well, its faster than the other line as the main line was 3 hours at that point  That is poor management and poor customer service. There wan't any way we were going to wait another 45 minutes with a six year old   let alone consider waiting in the main line. Clearly Disney handed out too many fast passes to make money and in our case took it without us ever having a chance to redeem the pass. We left.We spoke to several other Disney staff and they were as indignant as the others. Fair warning... if you think that the fast pass system will truly make your park experience a skip the line experience   think again. The staff acted tired and overworked and under  Disney ed . This was a very expensive   average experience and we will chose other parks in the future.",-1
"We have recently got back from a 5 day, 4 night break in DLP. We stopped at the Davy Crockett Ranch which I was pleased with but I will write a separate review for that. This review is for DLP. We are a family of 7, consisting of 2 adults & 5 kids aged 11, 10, 8, 6 and 2. It was half term so I expected it to be busy, but I did not expect the queues to ruin my time there. They were a nightmare. Queueing for 30 minutes is bad enough but lots of them were for 70 minutes! It states clearly at the beginning of the ride how long you will have to wait, but they have a clever strategy of hiding how long the queue is as most of it is concealed from view. My husband said he felt like Homer Simpson as every time he thought he was nearing the end DOH, turn the corner and there is another mile of queue! My 2 year old was a nightmare waiting as you can't constrain them in a buggy as you have to leave the buggy outside of the ride so he kept trying to run off. My other kids would get bored too, and would end up bickering with each other or climbing on the barriers (which you are not allowed to do). Tip   any electrical hand held device that you have, please take, it will help alleviate boredom and keep Mom & Dad from losing the plot! We paid for the half board option and I am so glad that we did as we would have spent a fortune otherwise. We did not spend hardly any money as I refuse to be conned by the extortionate prices that they charge for food, drinks, toys, clothes etc. We just took packed lunches into the park, with drinks and sat and had our lunch in one of the many picnic areas. I told the kids that if there was anything they wanted to buy, take a picture and I'll have a look on Amazon when I get back home for a 3rd of the price. Unsurprisingly there was nothing that they were desperate to get! The food in the restaurants was lovely. Plenty to choose from and a good variety. Although don't get choosing Billy Bobs, we went there the one night and we had to queue for about 30 minutes just to be seated. I booked my restaurant reservations before I went which I would recommend.The 5pm Parade is fun but the crowds ruin it for me. I was stressed out keeping an eye on all my children. Also, when it finishes, getting out of the park is a nightmare as everyone else is doing it to. The night time parade is fantastic. The castle being lit up with fireworks is wonderful, but again, it is so busy, getting a decent place to view it is hard work.I preferred Disney Studios to the park as I enjoyed the shows. The car stunt show was brilliant. Also, the timings for the various shows usually meant that you didn't have to queue for too long.There were a couple of parks but they were closed. This was disappointing as this would have given my husband and I a bit of chilling out time whilst the kids let off some steam (I have all boys who have lots of energy), as they were getting cheesed off with queueing. We used the free  magic hours , but everyone seemed to as well. Yes, it's quieter than midday, but still, you are looking at about 30 minute wait, if not more. We also used the free pass, but sometimes the queue to even get the free pass was ridiculous.Overall I'm glad we went as it was an experience but this was not a holiday for me it was more of a military mission. Maybe I would have enjoyed it more if I had 1 or 2 children, but as my husband said, it would test the relationship of even the strongest of couples. Would I go back? No chance. Would I spend a fortune going to Florida? No. Give me a holiday where the kids have freedom to run about rather than being constrained to a queue and I can chill out, then I'm happy! I can safely say we won't be visiting another theme park for a long time!",-1
"I kept asking family members if there were things to do at Disney that didn   t revolve around rides. Not really. Most of the rides suck. We were there on a slower day mid week in Feb. The wait times weren   t too long. 20 30 minutes. Even still, we waiting that long to get on to a ride that is really just a parade for a movie that was released years ago. The Park was under construction. I don   t really care about that part. The park was clean and the staff was friendly. The food was not memorable. When it comes time to eat, either bring your lunch from home or go to Downtown Disney. It is a nice perk that they allow you to bring in your own food. We also like they they would give you free water cups with ice upon request. I would be just fine if I didn   t come back to Disneyland. There isn   t anything here that is worth what you pay for. ",-1
We had been very excited to be visiting Disneyland and had been discussing which characters we were hoping to have photos taken with. The day we visited was a Sunday in October. Not one character was strolling the park   not one! We saw a stationary Maleficent and could have queued for a photo but didn't bother. It was pleasant walking around the park and very clean of course but became very crowded after about 11.00am. The queues for any ride were over an hour at anytime of the day so we only got to do four rides over the whole day. All up I would not recommend it at all. Very very expensive for not a lot of fun.,-1
"There is no free hot water. How am I suppose to heat up a bottle of cold milk? Secondly, I almost made it past the security checkpoint with a pair of scissors because they had checked the bag and it was good but when I was listing the things I was carrying, I told them about a pair of scissors. They confiscated that. Now how am I suppose to cut up the food. I mean this is suppose to be a family friendly park. ",-1
"The worst of the Disney Parks we   ve visited (all Florida, California and Tokyo parks). Other than the ease of getting to the property on the RER A line, there is very little to like about this subpar version of Disneyland. There are a much smaller number of    showcase    rides at this location, resulting in way longer lines than at US parks and an antiquated FastPass system that runs out of passes mere hours after the park opens for the day. The workers at this park were unhelpful and downright scornful or rude at times even for the most basic of questions. And the grounds sometimes had trash and cigarette butts laying around. You would never see that at any other Disney park. Finally, the size of strollers and backpacks allowed at this park are gigantic, resulting in some incredibly frustrating experiences as you try to navigate the park   s very narrow passage ways. We checked it off the list, but we will definitely never set foot in this place again.",-1
"its nice to the locals but not for turistswaste of time go to other parks, its expensive with no reason",-1
"We (a family of 10, ages 2 68) all visited Disneyland & California Adventure Park on February 16 & 17. It was a waste of time & money. Adventure Park: maybe 4 rides for people over the age of 7 and the waits for those rides were rediculous (1.5   2 hours). Many of the rides were closed or broke down during our visit. Next day at Disneyland, again rides closed, long waits, rides breaking down left and right and way too many people! We should have been told more about the parks when we purchased the tickets or even when I called in advance to ask questions. One park is primarily for little kids and the other, unless you pay for the Fastpass app and figure out how to use it quickly, don't waste your time or money going here. I personally cannot ride any rides due to medical issues, but still had to pay full price (rent for the space I took up while standing for hours waiting, possibly??)",-1
"Dear DisneylandAfter paying $1000USD for tickets for my family. I don   t think I   m being unreasonable to ask for the following. DISNEYLAND CASTLE I couldn   t believe that there wasn   t any notifications to advise you are renovating the castle and it   s currently all covered up. We missed our chance for the iconic photo in front of the castle. WORKING RIDES. we wasted so much time on your broken down rides. We were stuck inside Splash Mountain for 30mins and then escorted out of the canoes, through the attraction and out to the backlot. There was no apology. Indiana Jones broke down 3 times. My husband and daughter were stuck for 45mins and we were turned around twice due to the ride malfunctioning. Haunted Mansion closed as we approached with our fast pass and then we went up to Roger Rabbit in ToonTown only to be told the ride is closed after lining up. Then being part of an angry mob of people who were turned away and having to rejoin the back of the queue when it reopened. PLEASE UPDATE YOUR APP TO ADVISE WHEN RIDES ARE CLOSED!FIX YOUR WIFI Your wifi reminds me of Australia   s NBN, never working and only available in a couple of spots around the place. In 2019, it   s a minimum to offer wifi especially with a large percentage of international travellers. CROWD CONTROL last Thursday, I felt like a sardine. There must be a limit to the number of people who can access this place. It was really unpleasant being squashed in a crowd with young children and aggressive pram pushers. THE GOOD? Fast passes and golden hour. I would have left Disney without these options. Also having the option to go to California Adventure Park. It   s a shame that it   s taken me 44 years to get to Disneyland and although I enjoyed my day, it was Ted the magical experience that I hoped for. ",-1
"Have been to Disneyland before, as my wife is a California native. We have also been to many other theme parks all over the country as well. Now, when one goes to a theme park, crowds and long lines, as well as high prices for souvenirs, food, parking, and entrance into the park are to be expected. However, it was so crowded yesterday, you couldn't tell where the lines for the rides were, and walking was nearly impossible! In fact, we relished waiting in long lines, because it gave relief from the pushing, shoving, and getting the backs of your ankles run over by strollers! In eight hours, we were able to get on two rides. The part that will keep us from ever going back, though, was at the end of the day. We had a train to catch, and needed to exit the park to catch a shuttle to the train station at 2130 hours. We left the souvenir shop closest to the gate, no more than 75 yards, at 2100 hours.....it took us OVER ONE HOUR to get out of the gate. There was zero crowd control, and literally no way to move. Had there been a fire or some other emergency, there would have been casualties. BTW: we missed our shuttle.Does Disney not keep track of how many people are in the park? Can they not see the streets are so crowded you cannot move? I would advise folks to avoid this place, or be ready to shuffle, jostle, push, shove, be run over, stepped on, walked on, stepped on, and hoping the lines for the rides are long just so you can get a respite from the crowded streets!There were literally children crying and saying they wanted to go home. I guess it's no longer the happiest place on earth....",-1
"It was a public holiday and the park was full, with lots of excursions and people from mainland China. From the high price of the tickets (and that's where the waiting lines start) to every attraction, you can easily spend almost all day waiting to see or ride some of them. Even the children get bored of waiting, and after some hours they're the ones asking the parents to leave.I was at the Disneyland Park in California and it was much better, still a lot of people but not so much waiting. And there they have some very good rides, comparing to these in Hong Kong. They're childish and mostly appeal to the kids, but maybe that's the idea   although the children don't visit the park by themselves?!Oh and the food is also not so good, almost every stall has the same stuff (and sometimes also waiting lines, hey even to go to the toilet you have to wait!)",-1
"What can you say about Disneyland. For my wife and I, including parking, was $200.00 just to get in the gate. We went on 5 6 14 on a Tuesday, figuring that school was still in session so it wouldn't be crowded. Boy was I wrong, it was crowded.The following rides where closed: Indian Jones Adventure Pirates of the Caribbean Small World   my wife's favorite Finding Nemo Sub Voyage Sailing Ship ColumbiaIf there going to close rides, I wish they would publish it on their web site in a place that can be easily found.The following rides broke down while we were there. Roger Rabbits car toon spin Peter Pans Flight Haunted MansionWe where in the Haunted Mansion when it went down, just beyond where you get out of the elevator, before you get to the cars. It was crowed and hot. They kept announcing that the ride would start in a little bit. So more and more people came out of the elevator, and it got more crowded and even hotter.The bottom line was it was about an hour before they admitted it wasn't going to run, they apologized, and promised everybody some kind of Disney Bucks, that didn't happen either.We did find some rides that worked and some good places to eat, that rescued the day.I do recommend the Soft Pineapple Ice Cream at the Tiki Room, Delicious.",-1
"I have no doubt that Disneyland was going off, circa 1982. But it has not kept pace with the times and it is just sad, dingy, shabby and rundown. And a total waste of money.I had a few laughs, but at one point the big rides (the ones for adults) ALL shut down except for space mountain with no indication when they'd reopen, plus a bunch like pirates of the Caribbean and finding nemo were closed all day. It was quite bizarre.What they need is wifi access, more signage in general, electronic signage letting you know what is open, ride wait times etc   all the things that people these days expect.But more importantly it was just the overall dinginess that was the biggest disappointment  happiest place on earth and magical is just a marketing ploy   an excellent one they do brilliantly. The reality is just old, dated rides that looked shabby and 80s. Even the staff in their awful uniforms looked like someone from the 80s trying to look 50s.Unless you have young kids, and I mean age ten tops, don't bother. It is just sad and overrated. Totally shocked at the good reviews this place gets. I think it just is one of those childhood fantasy places we all build up in our minds, and the reality is just awful.Save your money and go elsewhere!",-1
"After talking to a Disney rep at the hotel we were staying at, we decided to get the park hopper for an extra $50. It cost us $167 per ticket. Now you think the rep would have told us about the incredible wait times but nope, she didn   t....must work on commission.So we head to the park the next day, going through security is hilarious. They think they are protecting the country. My belt set off the metal detector. I told them it   s my belt. I was pulled aside, and they use a hand held on you, shirt up, belt buckle flipped...because you can hide so much behind that you know.We decided to go to Adventure first. When we got to Soaring, there was a 50 minute wait. Forget that, off to the next ride to find the same thing.We opted to go over to Disneyland where we found the same wait times. We had to suck it up and stand in line. We were so frustrated after 2 hours that we went on the boat that goes around in a circle just to say we went on a ride! The fast passes are a waste of time as well. You can only hold one at a time. We ended up going to get a fast pass for Soaring at 5 pm. We were given a comeback time of 8:30 to 9:30 pm....3 hours later!!At the end of the day, we went on 6 rides, 2 of them kids rides just to try and feel like we were getting value. It ended up costing over $27 per ride!!!I don   t know what bothered me more, waiting over 50 minutes per ride or the fact that nobody else seemed to be bothered.I wrote an email to Disney and got a so sad, too bad e mail back. I responded saying that we bought off or your rep and she should have told us that the park hopper was a waste of money. I received another e mail saying....are you still communicating with us on this matter? Sorry you didn   t like our response. We will not be refunding you anything. Our wait times are posted on our app......are you kidding me? I have to download your app to get the times!Their customer service doesn   t get it. They are making a fortune there and they don   t care about you. They don   t realize that not wanting to do anything for people just buys them what we spent 10 fold in negative advertising.Don   t waste your money. Go elsewhere.",-1
"We have earnt a degree in queuing with even the small rides taking half an hour before you got on. We were allowed to enter 2 hours early which helped but there were still large queues. The waiting time could be reduced if staff were more efficient in getting people on and off and if the equipment was working properly. We waited an hour for a 2 minute ride on a train with one going around empty and the remaining one had 2 carriages not operating. We ate lunch twice there and the food was awful and expensive   it cost 30 euros for sandwhiches, crisps and a drink for 2 adults and 1 child.The only good experience was the show that takes place just before the park closes.I would recommend that if you go and want to go on the Peter Pan ride use the fast pass option as the average waiting time is 1hr 30 mins and it is not that great. We went years ago and it is still the same.",-1
"The most important thing to note is that I grew up going to Florida Disney 2 or 3 times a year. I have also been to California Disney a few times, so I cant help but compare. I feel like this trip was a waste of money in all honesty. We went in April and did the trip  on the cheap  I suppose. We took a national express coach from London to Paris overnight and it was such a time and money saver. We got to paris about 6am and the coach was comfortable enough to sleep, obviously a bit disruptive to have to get off at customs Eurotunnel but other than that, pleasant. The round trip was only   100 total for 2 people which was a total deal. The train to disney was something like 15 euros total from Gare de Lyon, which we walked to from the station. As you can imagine we got to Disney well before parks opened. The few shops restaurants there were pretty rubbish options. We had McDonalds for breakfast. When we got into the studios park, Tower of Terror and Indiana Jones were clsed for the day. Aerosmith wasn't as good as Orlando. Over at the disney park, we had an alright day, watched one parade, Space Mountain was really good actually. The Ratatouille ride was brilliant. Lunch was awful  not enough options, we wanted to eat a restaurant but only 2 were open and not good choices, so ended up having a crappy hot dog. We left the park by 4pm because the day jsut wasnt going well. Our trip to Paris in general wasn't great but honestly, if its feesable for you, save your money and go to Orlando  that is the disney that I know and love.",-1
"Went to Disneyland this morning as I was suppose to be part of the Veterans Day Salute Program . It turn s out ( with no notice to the public , all entrance  FREE  on Birthdays &  FREE  Entrance to Veterans and active duty has been cancelled from here on in and prices are going to double on January 1st . I have raved about Disneyland here forever as the most magical; place on earth , but now they will never get my money again. I am a retired and 100 % service connected combat veteran and I feel doing away with the  FREE  entrance is a slap in the face especially when you are going to be a part of a program that has made Disney what it is today . Veterans and disabled and birthday folks have had free entrance for ever and now it is gone .",-1
"We were VERY disappointed with our trip to Disneyland this time: the new multi day ticket picture taking process that was just launched this winter is leading to unbelievable lines just to get in, tired and rude staff and patrons and a significant reduction of our time in the park (20 40 mins a day   more when we park hopped   lost to lines just to get into the parks). While we appreciate the need to stop people from selling sharing their multi day tickets, the staff at the gates need to find a better, more friendly way to manage the lines and to get people through the process and into the park. We lost a lot of time each day to the confusion and poor people management at the gates. For example, on Saturday, two monorail trains left in the morning empty as the staff at the Downtown Disney Monorail gates were unable to process tickets, take photos and answer the multitude of questions raised. The line just stopped moving. I have never experienced anything like it at a Disney Park and we go multiple times each year.We hope that they fix this quickly.",-1
"I planned a trip to southern california around disney and it happened to be the place we liked the least. I had the most miserable, tiring, hot day of my life. I went on a weekday to try and avoid the crowds somewhat. But 1.5  hour waits for the big rides. 45 minute waits for the kiddie rides. Lines to eat. Lines to go to the bathroom. I expected lines. But we barely did anything all day. We used the fastpasses as much we could. But standing in line all day in full sun when it is 100  degrees drove me nuts. Disney, please can you please get some more benches in the park. But what topped it all off was when i stood in line for about 1 hour we were the next group to ride, they told us they had to shut the ride down for the parade. So we waited in line for nothing. Also, when my fastpass time for star trek ride came, the ride was stopped for maitanence because it had problems. Terrible terrible park. I am sure i just had bad luck and the hot did not help. But it was insane and i will necer want to come back.",-1
"There were 9 attractions closed while I was there.  Thus, all the other attractions were really lined up.  Plus the park closed at 8 pm, making less time, less attractions for the same amount of money.  The bathrooms were dirty.",-1
They know they cannot service the amount of people they let in. Yet they look ack them in . 2 hours 1 ride wait. 1hr another. 45min to get food 25 minutes toilet. Your lucky to get 3 rides in for the day. They charge a lot more for an Express ticket. Seriously it's not a place to visit.. to give the kids some fun we went to parks with little wait...but they could have had the same fun at the local park.,-1
"I don't know where to start really.. Disneyland is supposed to be a fantasyland for Children with characters and princesses in abundance.. In the 2 days I was here myself or my daughter never saw one disney character. The rides were a disgrace, the queues horrendous, the staff miserable, the organisation poor, the fast pass idea is worthless and the food was awful and expensive and slow .. It really is that bad. I live in Blackpool in the UK and The Pleasure beach at   5 admission is infinitely better. I am surprised at Disney being associated with this place... But maybe they have become a big con too. I have been to Florida and loved it and have booked to take my daughter on a Disney Cruise around the Caribbean next spring but I will be cancelling that after this experience. I have spent   1500 for a 3 day trip to this so called fantasy world .. The only good thing is that we had the option of a fourth day but declined. How on earth can it be called Disney without any characters there... Even my 6 year old was saying   Daaad can we go, this is not nice  take a good look at yourselves Disney and do yourselves a favour and get the hell away from this place.",-1
"Visited for 3 days with my husband and 5 year old son, and couldn't wait to get home. It was absolutely abysmal, the crowds are dangerous, I mean there are so many people it's literally dangerously overcrowded. The queues for everything are disgraceful, you spend 8 hours in the park and have time to go on about 4 rides due to the queues, we bought an autograph book, and got 2 autographs the whole time we were there, as the queues for meet and greets are all over 2 hours long. I'm not sure how there are so many positive reviews for this place, it certainly isn't  magical  or  special  it's ridiculously overpriced and incredibly stressful. Some of the staff are incredibly rude too, one physically shoved my husband out of the way when he was stood waiting for the parade. Even my son hated it, by the third day all he wanted to do was go back to the hotel and play on the little park, I regret massively paying for this family holiday. My advice to anyone thinking of booking... don't do it! You'd get more  Disney magic  from a Disney DVD... Either save for the parks in Florida or take a trip to your local theme park where you'd have a much better time and save an absolute fortune. ",-1
"Not being a native Californian maybe I just don't get it, but I would rather jab bamboo under my finger nails than spend another day at Disney. Fake, manicured, corporate is what I see...if this is the happiest place on earth God help us!! My sister and I took my nephews there and what I remember is lots of waiting in line, bad, overpriced, food and a few fun runs down the Matterhorn. Even the boys seemed underwhelmed; the older one said to me  Disneyland is OK, but I'd rather go to the tide pools at Crystal Cove! ",-1
"If you really want to go, go.But you should know beforehand:1   there is no respect: people smoke in the entire park, although there are areas designated for that. Peolple smoke in the lines, in the face of children(including yours) with that blas   face. The employees did not see it (there are few, comparing to USA). When they do, they do nothing about it, or just do not care.2   People usually cut line. Yep, it is true( I saw a lot of this complaints here in Tripadvisor) .You have to be paranoid in a vigil to prevent this to happen. The staff do nothing as well.3   There are many (not all of course) rude employees. Very rude.4   it is very disorganized. The fastpass not exist in some attractions, and in others there are only few of them.5 the food is expensive (but this is not what bothers me at most)In summary: It is not Disney. Disney means joy, respect, a place for children and adults that go to the park with good intentions, respecting others and with a good spirit. Is not what happens here.I suggest a few things: the first, and best : save your money and go to the U.S., which is the real Disney (can be Orlando or California). The second: if you live in Europe and can not go to the U.S., but really want to go  Disney , be prepared....Paris is such a wonderful city, so do not waist your time here!",-1
"We came here not knowing what to really expect as we had heard mixed reviews from friends about DL HK. After visiting, I can say this theme park is really catered towards young children as rides and very tacky, uninteresting and not thrilling.   My title...More",-1
"I went to Disneyland 20 years ago and loved it as a child. This time   in my late 20s   I went again with two friends and was shocked. There had been no extensions   it is the same park where they are doing some refurbishments with WAY TOO MANY People. Instead of extending the park, they speed up the rides... so you have the queue for approx 60 minutes for a really short ride.The Disney characters used to walk through the park and you could take pictures. Now the kids and parents need to queue for approx. 60 minutes to take a picture.The fireworks at 21h are recommendable   but for the price you have to pay to get in, I would not go back. Go to other parks instead!Worst of all! There is no proper food. You have a choice of disgusting and cheap    food      NO healthy or vegetarian options available. The snacks you can get are disgusting waffles, crepes and crisps. No selection.I love disney but they are ruining the experience for everyone.Go with time:   offer healthy options to eat and a wider selection  Either open new rides to spread the mass of people or limit the amount of tickets.  Reconsider most of your processes and become more efficient.  have the disney characters waking around to spread the magic for kids  stop opening more shops!!! There are more than enough",-1
this park is good for the young kids and the Halloween shows parades were brilliant but the whole place is in need of some serious maintenance   TLC you never see any one cleaning in America that is all you do see. people are smoking every where and no one asks anyone to stop the whole place needs several months cleaning   maintenance. The food and snacks are way to expensive crazy prices & not even good quality buy from the supermarket and take in with you. the Disney merchandise is more expensive than it is in the shops in the uk. I purchased a planes toy in the UK for   20 before we left from Disney the exact same toy 40 euro in Disney twice the cost.The queues are huge with very few fast passes available. you are called for the shows way before they start to give them more time to force merchandise on you it is hard to tell kids no when they are having flashing lights etc waved in front of them. the whole place needs to concentrate more on being great disney experience than a merchandising exercise more merchandise would sell its self if the experience was improved and above you are also paying a large entrance fee as well . come on Disney sort it out.,-1
"Much bigger than I was expecting. Heard so many stories about how small it is, but with small kids it's actually great. Very good for young kids, but older kids would be bored quickly. As usual, food & drinks are exorbitant. Night parade was greatGiving it 2 stars for no wireless internet in the park.",-1
have been coming here regularly with family . its not got that draw any more . it was easter holidays.  park was so busy with children . waste of money for oldies like us .,-1
"They didn't handle things professionally, it was overall a terrible experience to begin with. the lines took an hour and a half or more, keep in mind it wasn't even a busy day it was a Tuesday. People were very rude, they just didn't deserve the money they got from us and I will never be going back.",-1
"Don't know what promos or such Disney has going, but this year has been off the charts busy, even on days its not supposed to be.",-1
"I'm in a wheelchair and the place was so busy it made it impossible to move around to get to the attractions. After the first half hour , I wanted to leave. The majority of rides were inaccessible. The park was an unfortunate waste of money. What a disappointment for this disneyland experience. We left early allowing our grandchildren to enjoy their day as we had been slowing them down drastically.",-1
"decided to book thought Thomas Cook as taking the grandchildren for 3 nights 4 days. I had checked all the prices for trains etc and decided on the plane. glad we did. this was a good choice as we were collected from the airport and taken to the hotel. Cost   400 for flights for 2 adults and 2 kids age 6 and 4.Hotelcost   400 ish for half board. food wasnt great. salad bar not very inventive. and the main meals were ver poor. breakfast was continental style and if you wanted a cooked breakfast you had to lay out another 4 euro each. I paid for an omlette and beans for the grandson as he doesnt eat bread which is a real issue. but it was swimming in fat and he wouldnt eat it. the room. nice no issues.. clean etc. the kids had bunk beds and were really comfy. our bed was dredfull. was like two camp beds put together with a mattress on top so therefore a dip and ridge effect kettle in the room was a bonus and a hairdrier in the bathroom.. nice shower and bathif your self cat ering.. there is NOT a single shop anywehre in the vacinity and you would need to catch a train to the next town. we wanted to buy coffee as it was costing us 6euro for two smal cups, but no where to buy it. all hotels are around 15 20 minutes on the shuttle bus to disney land. and the busses go regulalry all day.had to pay another 540 euro for two days park entry.. so were now on   1500 for 3 nights. day one was spent queuing for 2 hours to see a princess and 1.5 hours to see mickey mouse. i expected to see charactors walking around.. nope.. not one. the kids were so dissapointed and i honestly wondered what the hell i had wasted   500 on! feel really ripped off. fish n chips (spot the fish) and fish finger and chips for the kids another   50 a time. everything is quadruple the price you wil pay in a disney store at home. we did the roudn the world boat which was good and the parade was good too. the paddle steamer was 15 minutes that i will never get back and apart from an old farmer (model) rocking in a wheelchair that was all there was to that. the kids kept asking to go back to the hotel to go swimming or in the play area (soft play)we met a family on the last day who told us that for our age group of kids they would have enjoyed the Disney odeon..but you do need a third day.Do not buy your tickets from the actual Disney land as we did!! we should not have paid for Harry as he is actually not 4 until march. so should have been free but they dont ask you for ages they simply charge you and i didnt ask.also the hotel were doing days for the price of 2 and we didnt realise that. also. on your tickets you are entitled to FREE PRIORITY PASSES.. no one actually tells you anything. and we need not have queued all the time.........would i return? i honestly dont think so.. its a lot of walking. a lot of money and altogether cost 2k which would better have been spent on an all incluisve holliday somewhere hot !i was so dissapointed with the place. i really wanted and expected for my grandchildren to see fairies and charactors that they know and love. but apart from the parade there was nothingnot for me",-1
"Grumpy staff, long lines, nothing for a 2 year old to do except queue, constant music blaring overly loud music from every corner of the very small park. Basically if you've been to any half decent theme park anywhere in the world, it'll have more to do and have better rides than HK Disneyland. Yes it's very pretty, but i was expecting a much better attention to detail and at least something for small children to do. The day started by us being told off by a member of staff because our 2 year old was having a drink of water on the train (it was a hot day), and went downhill from there.It is incredibly small, we went when it was supposedly quiet, I'd hate to see it when it was busy. It might be better for older children but there's still only about 6 rides so save your money and spend the day looking at amazing Hong Kong and take the kids somewhere better when you get home. Maybe I'm used to theme parks in the UK, USA and Australia but still I was expecting more from Disney.",-1
"We stayed at the chayan hotel about 6 years ago and had a fantastic time at disneyland. My wife is a Disney fanatic and my son was 6 years old we spent every day loving every minute all the carictors were out and about interacting with the visitors etc.We went again this year and took our son who is now 11 and daughter who is 5 we stayed at the sister hotel santa fe this was as plesent as the last time we stayed food was still less than appealing and what a change barely any carictors to see half the main rides closed ie crush coaster Peter pan ride and over the course of 5 day 6 rides broke down.Going to see the princesses is madness as you que for about an hour were there you see only 1 and can't choose who or even get told who your seeing unless you want to pay    60 per person to have a meal with them and then you only get 3 princesses and 1 prince.There are some carictors out but at set locations but never at the same time each day, when you ask the staff what time they will be out the next day that can't tell you or give you the wrong time so most of your holiday is spent sitting around and wasting time waiting due to poor information. Food was still poor throughout the park and very pricy about    80 for a family of 4 with a desert and 1 drink each average price for a kids meal is    14. And a small bottle of coke will set you back about   2.50On this holiday I had to complain on two separate occasions not all but many of the staff were rude and did not care it was more shut up and put up attitude and we will never be returning again. My understanding alot of the problems have come down to staff reductions to save money due to the lighting show that has cost 20 million all I can say is drop the show it's about the kids and bring back all the carictors that's what they want to see.",-1
"The park is well maintained and clean, and most of the staff is helpful. That   s the positive side.The rest is rubbish. If you go, bring a lot of patience. You have to stand in line everywhere. If you want to have your picture taken with one of the famous Disney princesses, wait for 60 min. If you want to go on a ride, wait another 60 min. If you want something to eat, wait in line for 30 min. When we left people were taking seats waiting for the parade 45 min later. My kids (5 and 8) were very disappointed. We managed 3 rides during the 6.5 hours we spend there. I   d say the time spend was divided into 3 hours of waiting time, 1 hour of sitting down eating, 2.15 hours walking and 15 min ride. The fast pass is a joke, we got a time slot 4.5 hours later and by that time we were long gone.Don   t bother, I for sure won   t be coming back!",-1
"Disney is supposed to make your dreams come true. Sadly the magic disappeared on day one when we arrived. The accommodation was fine, beds nice and comfy, a good size and clean. No kettle or drink making facilities in the room. We had to hire a kettle    25, which came with nothing !! Oh of course you have to buy a tea package to go with it.    9, what does that have in it? Four paper cups, PAPER CUPS ! Four tea bags, UHT milk in pots.Sugar and four biscuits. No thanks . Bought cups from store and got t bags from restaurants. Needed a wheelchair, no mobility scooters! Okay, you need to walk to the park for 20 mins which is quicker or catch the bus. Done ! In park you have hire scrappy wheelchair which didn't open properly or steer well.    125:00 deposit and    45 a day as well as the evening before use and morning of return even when we were not in the park.    90 to have it sitting in the corridor. The hotel would not return it for us. Bad organisation skills came to mind.....No facilites for a quick meal for the kids. Restaurant     27 per head all you eat buffett. No good for kids and diabetics on portion control. Bar snacks   all we offer is a slice of pizza and a pot of pasta heated in the microwave. So five portions and drinks   54 : (Breakfast buffet. Nothing for diabetics at all. Sugar cereals, fruit in syrup, white bread, cheeses, croissants......oh dear!On site queues everywhere. Expensive food and poor quality. Broken rides, rides closed and kids cold and disappointed. We had to queue to see Mickey, Whinnie the pooh and no other characters around. Very saddened by this. The best bits........ rides that were open, the parade was frequent and really exciting, Christmas lights everywhere made it look so magical, fireworks were heavenly but on too late so my children missed them. The best thing of all was the Character breakfast, it made their trip. Lots of food and lots of characters to visit them.",-1
"Disneyland has always been overpriced but it's fun, I suppose. If we didn't have kids I probably would never go back because it's such a huge waste of money. The kids who work the rides are friendly for the most part and the food is mediocre. It was insanely crowded the last week of January. I can only guess that was because of the unseasonably hot weather. All in all, overcrowded no matter what time of year, overpriced for what you get, and the food is overpriced and underwhelming. ",-1
We were here 5 years ago and found this trip very different. Last time there was definitely an atmosphere of a very happy place but this no longer exists. It   s too crowded and you have to wait too long for the rides (even in Winter). Too many strollers motorised rides that you constantly have to watch out for. A couple of the best rides were closed for renovation but overall the park looks old and needs a good revamp overall.,-1
"I spent 4 days 3 nights here. It was awful, complete rip off. Don't go if you can help it.All shops are the same, lovely beautiful buildings and houses but nothingness in side. If you like the same merchandise being thrown at you in every building that resembles a house, then fair enough. Why couldnt they have Mickey and Donald having tea or doing a stooges act of some kind? Just shops shops shops. Overpriced crystal Mickeys etc too much branding, not enough fun.Freezing weather in February (biting cold), which is natural, but yet only food on the stands were coke and popcorn...where's the hot food? Tea, coffee? Jacket potatoes? I was in awe of their lack of common sense, the person running it is lacking something in their head. Plenty of clothes shops open. Plenty of Mickeys charging money for photos. The magic disappears as quick as your euros do.Every restaurant is like walking into McDonalds... awful. Food tastes horrible and there is little choice but burgers and hotdogs. The rides are seriously out of date, I'm 31, but my last visit was when I was 14yrs old, it was exactly the same. There is an extra park, but it reminded me of an industrial estate. The space simulator ride broke down halfway (after 45 minutes waiting in the cold), we got a brief apology by confused staff and led out the back door. Probably just as well because it had been boring as hell up to that moment.Most of the staff looked bored out of their head and it was like being in a gypsy fairground. The restaurants are quite obviously not large enough to cope with the number of tickets they sell, as you have to reserve. Staff sit everywhere with their hand gestures telling you not to do this, not to do that, don't sit here, get off the road, stop here, really started getting on my nerves after 2 days.Repetitive parades with annoying music (after 4 days you'll feel like throwing your coke at Mickey Mouse). The rides will have you waiting for an hour, but will last 3 minutes. We had a couple of good moments, the Rock n Roller coaster was good, the Little Mermaid show my 2 yr old loved, and the Cars ride. Thats all I can muster with positivity about the place. I was left looking at the hole in my bank account and feeling conned.",-1
"We were so looking forward to taking our family to Disney Paris. We have a 2 year old and a 4 year old. I am so disappointed, as was my husband. Please think twice before you make a decision to go here.Amongst everything else, if you are British now is a very bad time to be going over there, because of the    against the Euro. Once you get there, you are trapped. There is no local supermarket to stock up on soft drinks or snacks. There is nothing but Disney and it's merchandise for miles around. The whole thing is a very clever, expensive, well oiled machine. You HAVE to eat and drink there, and boy, do they nail you on prices. The food is ALL burgers, chips and pizza. Not bad for an odd day but any longer and feel like the man who made the film 'Supersize me'. Even the vile fast food is so disgusting. I was shocked as I thought the French even did fast food well. Not the case. For a simple cheeseburger, no drink or fries you are talking about   7. For 4 of you, even very little children who eat hardly anything, to eat in Rainforest Cafe, you are talking   80. Easily. My 2 year old has come home with 'French Belly'. It was dirty. You don't expect that in a Disney Resort anywhere. A nice reminder for the long trip home.  We stayed at the Hotel New York, not actually a bad hotel. But even their room service food was similar, with little choice. A tiny, burnt pizza here cost   20 to be delivered to your room. Because it is a Disney Hotel, British families, I am ashamed to say, were letting their kids run wild. They were screaming and running up and down the corridors at midnight and the same from 6.00 am. I felt like I was in Disney Hell.If you want to see the Disney Characters, which is what sets Disney about from other theme parks, you will have to get in line. And wait. It's as if they are rationed to the public, unlike the US versions (why??? Isn't this their USP?). Your kids will either have to queue up, for half an hour to meet them and have a picture taken, or you will have to fight with hundreds of French and Italian people, to get near them. It was awful. Grown adults were shoving little kids out of the way or trampling on them. I saw a British woman in tears with her baby in tears, and another British couple ending up in a row with a horrible Italian woman, who knocked their little girl for six. It was that bad. Not quite the magic I expected. My own daughter wept because she couldn't get near anyone. So disappointing.We were told to go mid week. Which honestly wasn't much better, than the Sunday when we arrived . If you like queuing for 45 mins per kiddie ride, be my guest. This is the place for you.Some of the areas needed a lick of paint. The staff around Disney, I have to say, were pretty nice. You'd expect that for 2 adults paying   70 per day. The French that are there, are in the main, so rude, queue jumping pushing and shoving their way to the front, it will make you wish you had stayed at home.We asked my 4 year old daughter what her favourite part of the trip was. She very innocently said,'swimming in the hotel pool with Daddy'. That tells you everything you need to know. I think that Disney in Florida would be a much better choice if you could afford it. But please, save yourself time and money and a lot of stress and don't bother with the Paris one. I wouldn't set foot in that place in a million years.",-1
I decide to go see this attraction to compare the ones in Anaheim and Florida ! Sad to say it's a total bust ! Long walk from parking to Disney Entrance gate ! Some major attraction were closed for maintenance! Long long lines to ride most rides! Food was total overcharge and plain average! Service ? Hah hah they think they doing u service by pointing out where I want go? So pity enough said about the Disney I remembered in USA ! That's a must see if u have young ones ! Really so pity! Andre,-1
"Pros: If you like Disney stuff you'll have fun at any Disneylands. The Buzz lightyear (laser tag guns) attraction is fun. The Lion King show is really good too.Cons: Lots of rude park guests. One of if not the smallest Disneys. Also, quite far from town (it is near the airport) so if a is airport d is disney and tc is town center, it is like this:a....d....................................tcThere are lots of Chinese mainlanders   I think these are the main source of revenue for the park   so prepare to be shocked by the cultural difference: constant queue barging, invasion of personal space when they are forced to queue (they will probably be sniffing the back of your head or rubbing against your backside)   as if this shorten the queue time, people smoking outside designated areas, ill mannered kids screaming, littering and running around AND on your lucky day you might see the Disney parade as well as the golden showers or golden poop parades performed by Chinese kids.The goods: Buzz lightyear, Lion King show.Tips: Go on weekdays. Avoid queueing with rude looking park guests (the Chinese mainlanders). Get fastpass. The park is REALLY small so if you see a sudden long queue at an attraction, just come back later. It'll save you a lot of time.",-1
"We have been to Disney Florida & California and loved both of them. We only have memories of happy times.We knew August would be busy at EuroDisney so expected the queues for the rides and that the parks would be very crowded. Nothing prepared us for the amount of pushing, shoving and queue jumping. The restaurant food was terrible and the toilets were stinking.However, we had two really bad moments:The first was buying a Yearly Pass. The queue at the Annual Passport Office took 2 hours, despite the girl saying it would take 20 minutes. They are fanatical about you leaving buggies outside for Health & Safety reasons. They repeatedly asked us to do so, but we refused until we were close to the doors of the Annual Passport Office. When we eventually put the buggy with the others outside, our 2 year old daughter began to scream ...and scream ...and scream. She is in the Terrible Twos after all. We had one French man shouting abuse at us about her screaming. Inside we decided to complain about the long wait. The girl on the desk said   what do you expect, it's August!  We asked to see a manager, but she was another member of staff with an attitude problem. Basically they laughed in our faces. You pay a lot of money for Annual Passes and we expected administration to be fast, it isn't. What a waste of 2 valuable hours in the Parks.2) We came out of the Peter Pan ride late in the evening and decided to join the people gathering for the late night show. What a mistake! It became incredibly crowded in the area by the castle. Eventually there was absolutely no room to move. We were starting to get fairly worried by the pushing and shoving going on. On the one hand EuroDisney go on about not taking buggies into the Annual Passport OIffice for Health & Safety reasons, but people were trying to run us over with their buggies, so that they could get a better view. EuroDisney needs to take a good look at its crowd control, especially when you cannot see much in the dark. We would have liked to leave because we felt so uncomfortable in the crowd, but there was no room to move to exit.The only redeeming feature of the whole 4 days at EuroDisney was the parade at 7.00 pm, which was fantastic. Get your act together EuroDisney:  for the amount of money spent you expect better administration, better attitudes and better crowd control.",-1
"My wife and I only have one day at each park. So I booked us this tour for the morning of our Disneyland Park day.We did not have a magical time. We had a pretty slow group and we only got to go on 3 rides during our tour. The tour went from 9:45 (people showed up late and we we told to be there at 9:15) until after 2pm. Over four hours and only three rides.I knew most of the history already so the tour itself wasn't that great for me. When this would be worth it:*If you have at LEAST 3 days in the parks OR come here regularly throughout the year.*If you come regularly and want a SE Disney Pin*If you want a relaxing day and don't care about rides or waiting for things.*You REALLY want to see inside the dream suiteWhen this is not worth it:*If you only have one day per park. We missed out on a bunch of rides because the length of the tour.*If you LOVE rides and don't really care that much about history*If you have kids. Kids we were with HATED is and were so bored.We did not even go near Club 33 and didn't see Walt's apt or ride in the train.Long Story Short...I liked the tour in general (because I LOVE all things Disney) but it wasted a lot of our day and we missed a bunch of rides because of it...oh, and we went in early Nov when the crowds are much lighter...",-1
"This was are 3rd visit not good so much is closed this puts pressure on the other rides,all this at peak season,waiting times for most rides 45 60'we tried differant times of day early start or syayed late they really need to plan better and invest in more big rides last time we went you could use the fast pass system but this seems non exsistant now with only a few rides useing the system also why on the peter pan ride does fast pass not open until 11.30 it does not make sense. On two rides space mountain and pirates of the cariibbean it broke down just before we where about to get on this is meant to be a premium product they certainly charge premium prices i think for us this will be our last visit not worth the money or the hassle,get you act together Disney!",-1
"We were excited to be at Disneyland over Halloween weekend and looked forward to the decorations and excitement. We have never been during a peak season. It certainly was eye opening...First of all   we got 2 day park hopper tickets and because they were 2 day we ALL had to have our picture taken. WHY? Well, the cast member recited his lines perfectly about how it was to  protect  us in case we lost our tickets and someone else tried to use them.  Really , I said    so if we lose our tickets do you invalidate them and issue new ones? .  No.  This conversation went around in circles for about 2 minutes until I finally got him to admit that the REAL reason they MUST take your picture is to make sure you don't give sell your ticket to someone else. Nice.... BTW   you HAVE NO CHOICE. You MUST have your picture taken or they will not allow you in. Each person is linked to a ticket   yes, EVEN THE KIDS. And when you re enter, be sure you have the right person with the right ticket or you won't get in.Lines were outrageous and people working were crabby and generally unfriendly.Indiana Jones ride broke twice in the same day. Space Mountain also broke down. Tomorrowland future building is closed for a year to renovate it.FASTPASS tickets were a joke   more so, if you get a FASTPASS for certain rides you cannot get one for a different ride until you actually USE the first one.... such as Space Mtn and the Star Wars 3D ride.I guess the most upsetting thing was how DIRTY the park was. We have been here 4 times over the past 8 years and it has NEVER been dirty. NEVER. There were always people cleaning with rags, sweeping, etc. There were papers, food, gum, all kinds of things ALL OVER THE PARK and we only saw ONE person in the two days we were there that was sweeping. Very disappointing. Walt would be ashamed.We were travelling with grandparents in their 70s and at one point they just could not walk anymore. They showed their handicapped state issues cards to access the Haunted Mansion and it took 2 people to come over and be both rude and uncompassionate to tell them they had to walk ALL THE WAY back to the front to the main building to get a pass. They issues a FASTPASS and said to return in an hour   but it was apparently a big inconvenience for them.The next day they went directly to the Main Building to get a  pass . They were told that unless they rented a wheel chair they could not be assisted. More so, they were told by a cast member that it was a  park and you should expect to walk around a lot and wait on line if you are here . Nice. Very nice. Luckily we were with them and the grandkids had us to run around with them. But tell me, does this mean that grandparents are no longer welcome into Disneyland with their grandchildren unless the kids (regardless of age) push the grandparents around in wheel chairs? Completely unacceptable. I do realize that people abused the privilege and were hiring people to go to Disneyland with them to get line passes, but please.... these people are in their mid70s.... this wasn't a joke. Shame on Disney.I guess like all things, it has become completely and totally commercialized and the care and interest in making it a fun, family friendly, clean experience has passed. It's a business. And it has succumbed to the  make money  no matter what it takes mentality.... Sad thing   we were treated better and enjoyed Knotts Berry Farm more... now THAT says a lot.",-1
"Myself and my boyfriend visited Disneyland Paris in March 09. We had previously visited Disney World Florida back in Sept 08. Disneyland Paris had NO magic from the moment we arrived till the moment we left!!! The parks were obviously a lot smaller hence meaning longer que's compared to Florida. Fast pass was hardly open even though there was about over an hour ques for each ride. I think if you have already been to Florida you will absolutely HATE it here. There was no magic, no exact times to what parades floats would be on show (e.g. High School Musical was not even scheduled to be on show whilst there but appeared 4 times in 2 days!) the staff were very unhelpful and cold, the public (French, Germans) were very very very rude and has put me off every wanting to go back there. They had no care what so ever and were pushing into ques where we had waited for over an hour, walking into you and just being generally pig ignorant. The price of food there was ridiculously expensive compared to Florida. You are looking at paying around 15 euros for a cold burger, cold chips and watery drink. RIP OFF!! I wouldn't ever go back there and am saving my money to go to Florida again where you get much more value for money and an awesome time!!",-1
Total nonsense prices of the tickets if we consider the service provided.Very long lines to each entertainment for a 2 3 minutes joy.Hard Core price of the food to say the least. Scheme of the fast past tickets with the park hotel guests at least questionable.When you visit you understand the brutal profit of this company.Magic in their pockets.,-1
"Huge mistake! I thought the crowds during the summer were bad. They make the park seem empty compared to going during spring break. A 3 hour wait for the new Cars ride and fastpasses were all out by 10:15? No thanks. 2 hour wait for Space Mountain? Just trying to walk around was diffiult. Next time, we are going to take our kids out of school. At least the kids had fun.",-1
"I moved out west 5 years ago, from the east coast. Having been to disneyworld 15 timewithout ever having a problem I decided to book a stay at disneyland. I was suprisedby the big differences between parks.The bath rooms were very dirty,the fast pass mashineswere being stocked by 8 am and running out by 9 am, the grounds were dirty, I would neverrecommened disneyland to anyone, save a little more go to disneyworld, its larger,cleanerand more attentive. our trip was off peak, Id hate to see what peak time is like",-1
"okay i went to disneyland in los angeles and i have to say it really sucked the lines were very long the staff were really rude and they only have 2 thrill rides which are California screamin and space mountain which are very ordinary for thrill rides aside from that i would say it is a good place for little young girls since it doesnt have much for others,anyway if you are thinking of going to a thrillpark in Los Angeles go to Knotts berry farm or six flags they are heaps better",-1
The lines just to get through security were over 45 minutes long. Then you have to stand in line again to buy tickets if not pre purchased. Then stand in line again to enter the park. I do not recommend coming here anytime around the year end holidays. The crowds are just too big. ,-1
"Ok, lets start off by saying the kids(7 and 4) loved it. Thats the end of the good news. The park itself seen thru an adults eyes is a sorry looking affair. The price of everything which is well documented on here is extortionate and is only half the story. To eat you may need to go to a loan company first but then you are lucky to then EVEN get to eat. The restaurants are few and can't handle even a half full park. The first day after traipsing round with the kids and looking forward to somewhere to eat and sit down was an eye opener as you can't get a table unless you reserved it in advance which is ludicrous.When we visited over Easter, Space Mountain was closed, so was the Haunted Mansion, the Runaway Mine train had a fault(which was fixed by lunchtime(which is just to give you a timeline as we never actually got to eat)) and the Buzz Lightyear ride broke down as we were halfway round... I like the French but they revert to type on the ride changeovers. They are so slow at getting people off an attraction and new people on that it adds an eon to the queue time. Some of the rides are no better than local fairground rides..(step forward Snow White and Pinnochio)The shows are OK but are so dangerous as you get herded into these waiting areas before the doors are opened and people are jostling for the front that myself and my wife were keeping a firm grip on our girlsYou know that it is going to be a stamina slog with all the walking but you don't expect a law of the jungle attitude as people push, pull and are rude..Overall, it will be our one and only visit and if you are thinking of going, stick with Thorpe Park, Alton Towers, Blackpool Pleasure beach or one of the other theme parks. If you definitely want Disney, save up and do Florida.. Disneyland Paris just wants me to get the rat poison out for Mickey...",-1
"This review probably won't even reach the web. I swear the bad reviews are filtered by the rat himself. It makes no sense to me that sooo many people give this place good reviews. We were at Disneyland on 12 27 and 12 28 2010. Turns out so were 80,000 fellow suckers. I cannot fathom why so many people would subject themselves to waiting in line for $80 per person per day. We waited an hour to park, a half hour to board the shuttle buses to drop us in line to wait another 1 2 hour to get into the park, only to be herded down main street to enter one of many excruciatingly long ride lines. One of which exceeded 2 hours for the 2:42 min. duration Space Mountain ride unbelieveable. (First time we tried to ride Space Mt. we waited for 1 2 hr only to be told by Space Commander Tom that the ride was down and  check back later in the day to see if it was up and running.  This happened to us on the Indiana Jones ride as well, but thankfully we had just shuffled into line when that news was dropped on us.)We got a great deal with plane flight, hotel and rental car, but I kept thinking of the foreign suckers that shelled out probably twice what I did to enter the rat trap. Tokyo $1,600, France $800...Hopefully they got deals like we did, but can you imagine hauling 4 people halfway across the globe to basically wait in line at the  Happiest place on Earth?  (It's like political talking points If you float it out there, many will actually believe it without looking into it guilty.)On the second day we were considering leaving at noon to take the kids to the beach (my idea), but I was voted down. I would have loved to see the kids be able to run in the sand instead of stand in line ride on my worn out shoulders again. I have read another review of a guy that  enjoyed spending time in line with the family chit chatting.  (Hey Scandanavian Donald from Newport, I'll flip the bill for your whole family to return to Disney if you can send me a video of your family just  chit chatting  in line for 2:15 hrs.)I know there are ways to beat the crowds (fast passes you're only allowed one per family at a time and they sell out by around 10am), but I shouldn't have to work the system when I'm paying $80 for a ticket. Disney owes its customers to alleviate the crowds by limiting the number of people through the gate or putting all that revenue to work and create a thinktank to streamline the process.Bottom line Ask your friends about their experiences. We sprung it on the kids on Christmas morning so I didn't spread it around with fear that the cat would get out. On my return two co workers said,  You should have asked me, I would have told you it was going to suck.  And suck it did.",-1
"We went as part of a group tour so this visit was planned for us. As the title states, many of the attractions were closed for maintenance or remodeling and will be for many months. The ones that were working were overcrowded and prone to breaking down. We got stuck in the haunted mansion for about 20 minutes and Buzz Lightyear was stop and go. Peeling paint and tattered banners. Not the level that one would expect from the Disney name. Too few staff and too many guests. Even though attractions were reduced, the admission prices were not. No reason to go here. If you are going to go, at least do an internet search for the complete list of closed attractions and the schedule of repairs so you will not be too disappointed.",-1
We went here filled with excitement and had high expectations to be overwhelmed with joy after being told it is the  happiest place on earth . The park was absolutely packed when we arrived and we had to wait almost an hour to get parked and in the front gate. There hardly any thrilling rides or anything which was worth the 1 hour plus wait times so we spent the majority of the day walking around battling the insane crowd. All of the staff had fairly monotonous personalities and there wasn't a whole lot to see and do so we left after a few hours only. Universal Studios was so much better and a lot cheaper. Disneyland would probably only be good for little children.,-1
"The cast members in some instances were not friendly, nor was the service on rides, kiosks, or stores what we have become accustomed to at a Disney resort. If Walt Disney were alive and waking around his park, I think he would be alarmingly surprised. The parade and fireworks were wonderful as always. Toontown is in the sun almost all day and the wee ones couldn't ride anything because of the 100 degree heat. It was a waste of time to even walk over there. The train station on Main Street didn't have a ramp for strollers to get to the station requiring two people to carry the stroller upstairs. We couldn't find a handicapped ramp or elevator to get up there. Park hours have been reduced and ticketing prices have gone up, up, and away. Of course, this maximizes their profit and bottom line. We stayed at one of their hotels and the extra hour does no good because only a limited number of rides are open that extra hour. It is almost like they don't want you there anymore.",-1
"The crowds are a cause for safety concerns. We arrived New Year   s Day (which was actually nice) however today January 3rd.... the crowds were so large it was aweful..... The park is decorated extremely nice, especially showing its beauty at night. The average    main    rollercoasters averaged 2 3 hour waits when not using fast pass. Enjoyed most of my trip, but hope not to come back again for 5  years at least.",-1
"Fancy a visit to a theme park where you have to queue almost an hour for every ride? How about walking while saying  excuse me  every 2 min? That was our experience at Disneyland on a weekday in Spring which was not a school holiday. How crowded can it get during its peak season then?? The park is not big, if you take a walk around to just have a look it'll just take you an hour to see everything in the crowd. We only got to go on 4 rides as each time there was a queue of 45min. The other popular rides such as Its A Small World? Forget it! 75min! A photo with Mickey? 60min wait. It's just impossible to queue that long without small children getting impatient. We didn't enjoy our visit due to the crowd but I think for little children it was still magical to see Mickey or a princess walking around. ",-1
"I went to HK Disneyland on 5 April which happens to be Qing Ming festival and did not expect the massive crowds on that day. Queues for rides and F&B outlets were very long and we did not have a great experience especially with a young kid. For the amount spent on the tickets, it's really a waste of money as we only sat on a few rides. I'm wondering if the park has any cap on the number of guests in the park as we had a hard time finding seats around. I booked my tickets via the Disneyland Hotel online but there was no info or confirmation given to me whether my park tickets are booked. In the end, I was unable to enter and had to buy tickets on the spot. Luckily, one of the cast members, Carmen, helped us to resolve the issue and let us access without queuing up again. Also the balloons there are overrpriced   HK150 for a helium balloon.",-1
"Just vistited Disneyland Paris this Easter weekend with our 2 children aged 2 (just) and 9. All in all it was an OK experience but we (the children mainly) were extremely disappointed at the absence of the characters. We were there for a total of 11 hours and saw Mickey, Minnie, Donald & Daisy on a parade float once! Even at that we were kept about 5 metres away from them. When we booked the trip and told the children they were really excited, mainly to be  meeting  the stars of Disney. There were NONE around the park! No hand shaking, photos etc as you are led to believe from their literature before your visit. Above all we had told the children that they would see them and they were looking forward to this so much. Our 2 year old kept smiling and pointing at photos of Mickey & Minnie with such excitement and were really let down not to have had this precious, promised meeting which in turn made us out to have filled them with false promises. We expected several characters in each zone to enhance the Disney experience and overall this was a total let down. We feel that Disneyland didn't fulfil their promises that they advertised. Our children saw more of Mickey on the Metro ads and around the city than they did in the park.",-1
"I came here with my girlfriend, she has been here before and loves it. I am not hating on this place, it is a cool place but for a couple or someone without kids I think it only has so much appeal. All the kids there seemed to love it, they all had huge smiles and it was awesome to see so many children having a great time. I just don't think there is much there for a purely adult demographic which sucks because adults pay the entry fees. Saying that, it is Disney Land and the place is pretty spectacular. The grounds are clean, well manicured and looked after, there are plenty of staff there to assist guests. The entrance fees are very expensive, 74 euros per adult for a 2 park pass for one day is pretty ridiculous in my opinion. I have been to many, many theme parks on 4 continents and this was the most expensive by far. The food and drink is also more than you would pay outside the park but it isn't ridiculously expensive to their credit. For most of the attractions you are looking at  30 minutes, saying that the lines did seem to move faster the majority of the time compared to the predicted wait. There are little electronic clocks at the front of the attractions that alert you on how long to expect. This is a good idea and allows you to time manage better. Most of the shows are similar to other parks like Universal Studios, Dreamworld and Warner Brothers movie world to name a few but they are still entertaining. The movie magic illusion show was amazing, probably the thing I enjoyed most in both parks. The movie studio park closes officially at 7 yet at 5:30 we couldn't buy food or drink from several of the vendors there. Be warned also that most the shows, rides and parades etc finish earlier at both parks well before closing ie at least an hour, be sure to check the program. I didn't get to go on a few of the rides but the simulator, pirates of the Caribbean and a few others that I thought would be exhilarating failed to hit the spot. I think the rides cater more to the kids which I understand but there are many rides coded blue which means family friendly for kids and only a few coded orange for exhilarating rides. The ones coded orange took it to a comfortable level but just when you are getting the adrenalin pumping seems to be where they peak. If you are a thrill seeker or there with some friends and want to experience some rides that are going to knock your socks off, I would recommend you look elsewhere.",-1
"They moan and groan every year and seem to constantly lose money. Yet their key attractions are closed for upkeep, it seems all the time. Food outlets are disgusting unhealthy rubbish fast greasy food. Full of junk shops and baby rides. When comparing this miserable place to Ocean Park its absolutely  no contest . Someone needs to be fired from management (n oxymoron in this case). Best skip it is my advice.",-1
"First Disney theme park experience and probably never to be repeated. For the amount of people visiting each day there are not enough actual rides so queues quickly stretch to over an hour. Fast pass helps a bit but still spent at least 80% of the time queuing and 15% of the time walking from one part to another. In total over 2 days went on about 13 rides across Disneyland and Disney Studios, so approx EUR 11   person   ride. Also because of the crowds, difficult to get onto wifi and even 4G. Expensive food and you inevitably have to queue even for the restaurants. Would advise any family to forget rip off Paris and rip off Disney and head to another city park (e.g. Europa Park in Germany, which is half the price, has far more and much better rides, and as a result you spend less time queueing). ",-1
"There is no doubt that any parent would feel that the money is worth it when they see the sparkle in their daughters as they see Disney princesses. However, overall we were disappointed with Disney Land Park. Having recently been to Universal Studios in Singapore, we'd had high expectations. Unfortunately the age of Disney Paris is showing and the lack of modern technology in the rides is evident. You could overlook the dated nature of the place, as they clearly can't be updating it all the time. But what we could not overlook is an overt attempt to gouge every last cent out of you. When it came to lunch time, there were no simple stalls to be seen where you could get a hot dog or a sandwich (we eventually saw one at 5pm). You are effectively forced to eat in one of their over priced restaurants. We settled for their  fine American all you can eat buffet.  For EUR30 per adult and EUR17 for a child above 3 years of age you got to eat very average food   oh and ONE glass of soft drink! For those of you with young children you will probably share the pain of even getting your children to eat (and don't think of your kids simply eating what you bring with you if you want to go in   they charge you at the door as you walk in!). This was after a poor experience on the ticketing. We booked the Mini Ticket which allows access to both Parks in Low season for a day. Unfortunately we had to postpone our trip due to an emergency and had to move it to high season. Their website tells you that you can top up if you want to use the ticket in high season. What they don't tell you is that you don't top up to the two park high season price   you have to pay much more. So be it, but it would be better if the website is a little more transparent on what it means to top up. I only found out after a few calls to their call centre in Paris   it's not shown on the site. All in all, the kids will always remember that they've been to Disneyland, but it would be good if the experience was improved as time goes on so that parents feel it is worth the price. ",-1
"We visited Disneyland, Anaheim with our 2 daughters on 18 May, Monday with a lot of expectation. We were traveling from Bangalore, India on vacation and Disneyland was one of the top attractions of the trip. However it turned out to be a disappointing and tiring experience for us and the children alike.I can go on for an hour about the experience but this is a short summary  1. We did not go on Sunday to avoid the rush and queues but it turned out to be a day where every show ride had at least a 30 mins. wait time, not to mention the 95 100 mins wait time for Space Mountain and Star Tours in Tomorrowland   not something we were prepared for.2. Out of the 9 hrs we spent there, we'd have spent about 2 hrs having fun and rest standing in queues   something very difficult for small children.3. Our daughters were excited to meet the Disney characters, they had seen and read so much about them   the long queues with up to 50 mins wait time just to take pictures with their favourite characters, ruined that excitement.4. There were characters like Cinderella hurrying past weaving through the crowd in Fantasyland. By the time we could tell our daughters 'Look Cinderella' the characters disappeared from our view. We were told the characters will be in a hall in Fantasyland where we could meet them. By the time we reached there it was 6 pm and we were told that the characters have left for the day. Disneyland is open till 10 pm, how can the characters leave at 6 pm?5. We missed quite a few important shows because of 6 7 hours of standing in queues. Later we learnt that there is a system of fast pass wherein we could avoid the queues for some shows by showing up in a specified time window. We had spent 30 mins at the Disneyland entrance in the morning speaking with multiple Disneyland executives trying to find out the best 1 day tickets for us but nobody told us about the fast pass system.6. Any to top it all, there are no parades on Mondays and a few other week days. We had missed that information. So no parades for the children. We left the park around 11 pm and we did not see any fireworks as well.Overall, I am disappointed with our 'first' visit to Disneyland. I had read about Disneyland in MBA school. I had promised so much to the kids. And all we did was stand in the queues   well, mostly. The shows and rides were great but the crowd (on a Monday) really took everything away. This was our once in a lifetime trip (and expensive at about $100 a ticket) that went wrong.",-1
"We were visiting from FL and my wife wanted to see the original Disneyland. So we went on a Monday (thinking less crowded) We went to California adventure first, (thank god). Had a great time there. then went across the way to Disney and experienced a crush of people like I've never seen! Spent most of the afternoon just trying to get from one spot in the park to the next. I'm glad we went so my wife could check it off on the bucket list but we'll stick to the Florida parks where you can actually see the street in front of you.",-1
"We booked our 2days pass tickets in UK via the web site before our holiday in HK. It's really for our 3year old daughter as I've been to the one in Paris and Florida and thought it would be nice to spend some family time in a magical place.Good job we got a 2days pass as the following attractions rides were out of order: lion king show, run away mine train and slinky ride at toy story land. Hopefully lion king show will be available on our 2nd visit.Didn't realise you have to obtain some form of token to be able to join the queue to take photos with the Frozen characters so when we arrive at the area at 2pm we were told all token pass for the day have been all given out and we will have to come back another day.Fingers cross we can get a token on our 2nd visit tomorrow. Overall the Disney experience isn't one of my best in HK, and the park isn't big enough to spend a whole day with the family.",-1
"I'm currently standing in an hour and a half long line just to get on Finding Nemo. If your favorite ride is Space Mountain, expect a two and a half hour wait. The amount of people that are allowed into the park is ridiculous. We have to follow lines to get from land to land. I use to come here every year up through high school, never have I experienced so many people at Disneyland. Eventhough this is  peak season,  I wish those who operate the park would care about the happiness of the visitors who pay over $100 a ticket versus their net profit. Disney, everyone standing in these lines and herding through the park look miserable. Please take this post to heart.",-1
Even though had a fab time the park is dirty and very expensive. Everyone smokes in the q's and the time of the q's is ridiculous. It needs a good lick of paint and the staff were not very friendly. Our frustration is that you would be queing for ages and then people would just jump the q's and no one said anything!!!!! We enjoyed the studios but again needs modernisation as disney films and characters have now moved on .The shows in the studios were good. we paid a fortune so if honest save that bit extra and go to Florida.,-1
"Magic Mornings are a joke. Disneyland does not open all security checks so lines back up. They cannot move the people in the entrance gates quickly. Long waits to enter sets a bad tone for the day in  February, which has fewer visitors than other months.The happiest place on earth, has cast members yelling at a 2 year old pulling on the rope that he is holding to end the line to visit Buzz. What does one expect from a two year old who is waiting in yet another line.A very nasty cast member in city hall refused to discussed disability access when asked questions based on written material that disney publishes on their website.So much for the happiest place on earth.",-1
"I have now been to Disneyland Paris three times (well, actually the first time it was still Euro Disney). The first time was OK   despite it still being built. The second time (three years ago) there was a strike on so no parades and hardly any characters. Disneyland Studios at the time was sad and gave the impression that it was closing down and the food was terrible. We stayed at the Sequoia Lodge which, at the time, was actually very nice. Strange how things can change in three years. We returned in April this year due to a massive family get together (so Disney would not have been my choice). What a huge disappointment. Lets start with the Sequoia were we stayed. Clean, but poor service throughout. The bath towels were the size of hand towels, one soap between the three of us sharing the room for the duration, the plug in the sink didn't work (i.e. you had to use a nail file to prise it out) and only half the lights in the room worked. I have since found out from friends associates who have also stayed at the Sequoia that they all experienced this as well      we can   t have all stayed in the same room!The main park at Disney, shows signs of being run down. The trams seem to have disappeared, as have the old cars. The toilets were dirty and the parades were, how can I put this, pathetic. If you want to see a decent parade go to Bridgwater Carnival in Somerset!The Studios fared slightly better in as much as it looks like it   s had a lick of paint, since our last visit. However, again, it is almost as if they are trying to save money big time. This was particularly obvious in Honey I shrunk the Kids. It was so worn that the film was fuzzy and half the audience couldn   t feel the mice. We had to explain to those of our party that had never been before what was supposed to happen. Disney Village, like the parks, seemed very sad. Sad staff, sad service, and (like the hotel) half the lights in the signs didn   t work. Very seedy.So, would I recommend Disneyland Paris? If you have children and have never been to Florida     yes. They will be happy as it   s Disney. If you are going with other adults     no. It   s a massive rip off. Over priced, shabby and tacky. Even the fast food     isn   t (expect to wait up to 20 minutes for a burger    and that   s AFTER they   ve taken your order!",-1
"We stayed recently for Feb half term in the Davy Crockett hotel, whilst the accommodation was superb we were left disapointed by the park itself and the subsequent attempts to contact Disneyland. For our final day and on many of the previous days we had lots of rides breaking down, this was on top of many rides already being closed for refurbshment. The queues were then long due to the lower number of available rides. I have now e mailed Disneyland three times since my stay with no reply and through Facebook they have relayed that they answer e mails within 2 5 weeks!!",-1
"I was recently made redundant from my job of 15 years. I have 2 daughters aged 24 and 21 and we are huge Disney fans. We have visited Orlando on a few occasions when they were younger. I decided that I would use some of my redundancy money to fund a Disney trip as a treat. I could not afford Orlando so we booked a trip to Disneyland Paris and the three of us were very excited about it. The trip was a catastrophic disappointment. We stayed at the New York Hotel which was lovely   no real complaints there. We were offered the free meal plan which I upgraded to the Plus Plan.We arrived on Tuesday 28th June quite late and decided we would go into Disney Village for our evening meal. We decided to use our vouchers at Annette's. Whilst the food was lovely the service was unacceptable. We were served by a young waiter who advised us what we could order from the menu. I explained that I am vegetarian and so he said I could have the Veggie Burger, I asked if if was possible to change the toppings on the burger, the response was  no . Nothing else, just  no . We ordered drinks and I ordered a lemon fanta. Again the response was  you can't have that on your meal plan . I was very taken aback as this is not the kind of service I expect when in Disney. The food was lovely but the service left me feeling like I was a pauper expecting welfare handouts. It sullied the whole meal. I would have been prepared to pay for anything extra we wanted but that clearly was not an option.Nevermind, we thought, tomorrow is another day. We'll have fun in Disney Studios. How wrong we were. We arrived at the park at 11.30am, attempted to get into a Cinemagique and Art of Animation experience to be told to come back at 12 o clock. We then moved onto and spent the first half an hour queueing to get into the Armageddon  ride . It was absolutely rubbish. We couldn't understand a word that was being said and had expected so much more based on our Orlando experience. The day then goes from bad to worse. We next went to the Rock n Roller Coaster and expected to queue for one hour according to the notices. However, the ride broke down and so it was more like 2 hours that we queued. We next went to the  Behind the Scenes  tram experience and queued up for 20 minutes to then be told to go away as the ride had broken down. We were feeling very despondent and let down by this time. We moved around to Crush's coaster and queued up for half an hour to be told again that the ride had broken down and to go away and come back later. We decided to go into the Toy Story section of the park. More disappointment when we realised the Indy Car ride was closed for refurbishment. Never mind we thought, we'll go on the Parashute Drop. Can you guess what happened? After 45 minutes of queueing we were told that the ride had broken down and to come back later. By now this had totally ruined our day. We decided to try Crush again and after one and half hours of queuing we managed to get on the ride. Earlier in the day, around 3 o clock we had tried to get a fastpass for Ratatouille as the queue time was 2 hours but even though the park had 4 hours before it closed there were no fast passes available. So we spent nearly 8 hours in Disney Studios and only managed to get on 3 rides. Not exactly Disney standards or our money's worth.We were still unsure about the meal plan after our experience at Annette's and so decided to pay for a meal at Planet Hollywood instead that evening to cheer ourselves up.The next day we went into Disneyland Park with hopes that we might have a good day. We queued for 45 minutes for Buzz Lightyear (the wait time said 15 minutes). My girls were excited for some of the bigger rides and so we raced over to Space Mountain: closed. More disappointment. We raced over to Star Tours: closed. It goes on: Casey Jr: closed. Big Thunder Mountain: closed. Pirate Galleon: closed. Robinson Tree House: Closed. Peter Pan: Closed. Riverboat landing: closed. What a huge disappointment. We spent 12 hours in the park and the only rides we managed to get on were Indiana Jones after a horrific queue (no wonder as no other thrill rides were open) and Pirates of the Caribbean. We tried to get a fastpass for Indiana Jones at 2pm and bearing in mind that the rides didn't close til 10 that evening there were none left!We also ate in Blue Lagoon and I ordered the only vegetarian dish available and it came in a fish sauce so couldn't eat it.The whole trip was a huge disappointment from start to finish. Well over 50% of the big thrill rides were closed and added to that the number of rides that broke down we only managed a measly 5 rides after spending a total of 20 hours in the parks.This trip was meant to be a memory making trip for my daughters and I and it made all the wrong sort of memories. I don't think a review can fully get across the true disappoinment of the trip.I feel that my money has been taken under false promises. We booked with the intention of getting a Disney experience. Blackpool Pleasure Beach would have done better.I wrote to the CEO a week ago and havent even received an acknowledgement.",-1
"If you   ve been to the    better    Disneylands in Florida and Tokyo, give this a miss. Be assured that you will be disappointed. It is small, and on top of that, a bulk of it is under renovation.  Not worth a visit.",-1
"We found this the worst Disney Park around the world. It's far too small, not at all immersive in some areas. The castle was very small too, it just didn't have the magic. On a bright note, it's easy to get too for a quick few hours.",-1
"We had a great day out with my young children at Disney, there are lots of fun rides suitable for all ages and plenty of entertainment that you'd expect such as parade and bands playing music. The choice of food at restaurants is average but do try the mickey waffle with cream in his ears!!The worst bit for us was character meeting where the staff believe they are entitled to talk and behave with customers the way they like. We had first hand account of a couple begging to meet a character but they were turned down even though they'd come from abroad since they were five minutes late. We ourselves wanted to take our children to meet Donald but were slightly late since my wife stopped to help an elderly couple. I totally understand that being late is not an excuse and am not even arguing about it but the way the lady behaved and talked to us is at best appalling. We don't speak Chinese and she then started joking about us with other customers and they were all laughing. My family was very upset at this so I went to the guest relations team to lodge a formal complaint. The guy there took details of the incident on a small piece of paper and did not ask for my name contact. When I asked how they would send me feedback he said they don't but that he would raise it with the department of the employee concerned.",0
"If you have been to USA Disney or Universal Studios you would be very disappointed. If not, I believe you only need a one day pass as HK Disneyland is doable in 5 6 hours unless you wanted to stay for the fireworks at the end and of course, depending on queues. Focus seems to be on young children however there are some god rides and lots of eateries. Extremely clean. Make sure you can read the tourist guide map as there are not a lot of signs to the worlds. Souvenirs are reasonably priced and well within a tourists budget.",0
"It's the original. Got kids? Gotta do it I guess. For little ones it's great   the Park thrives on characters especially for girls. However with older boys the rides are getting dated which does not quite make up for the long lines. For us, Space Mountain & Matterhorn were good but nothing on California Adventure land next door. If you have little ones who are Disney mad then it's a must. Older boys will enjoy next door, Universal much more. Sorry Walt. ",0
"I moved to Florida 8 years ago and was visiting my home (California) over July 4th weekend with my family. It was the first time for my two year old nephew and I was a bit disappointed at the customer service overall. At the gate we were told my nephew could get a pin that said it was his first time at the park but they were out. They kind of shrugged and said we could go to City Hall to get a pin (which we were not going to do with two little ones). At the rides the customer service was not consistent....many of the employees looked like they did not want to be there and would chat amongst themselves. At Casey Jr's Circus Train my brother, nephew, and niece made it onto the ride and were saving a spot for us since my mom is elderly and we had to walk slowly....so her and I were waiting to board and my niece told the person working we were to get on with them and the worker ignored her and did not let us on. I do have to mention that at the Indiana Jones ride the customer service was spectacular and everyone looked and acted like they wanted to be there and wanted us to believe in the fantasy. at the Winnie the Pooh ride not so much. Anyway, of course I would go back but I wanted to mention that I noticed this change in service from years ago.",0
"This park has been around for a long time, but they charge you a LOT of money to visit it. It used to be ok because the prices for souvenirs and food were very reasonable. But that is no longer the case, expensive to get in and expensive to eat and to buy souvenirs. Here is something that I found the next day you can bring food and drinks in cooler. I highly recommend you do this. Also get there as soon as they open, because by 10:00 AM the park is full!!!",0
"I visited Hongkong Disneyland several weeks ago, but since my kids are below 4 years, I thought it's not worth to get in. So, we planned to visit but not buying tickets for entrance.Ok, we arrived at the station that connected with train to the park. Well, the train tickets costs quite a lot, around 28 HKD maybe I do not really remember. How we love to be in that train which all about Mickey, the window shape, the hand holder, and there are Disney's characters statue too on every corner of the compartment. We started to feel so Disney. We reached the station, still felt so Disney because within several steps we easily reached the welcome gate with Mickey statue on it.... Strolling along the way, and we reached a big fountain with whale and again Mickey on it, still excited and felt so Disney, until my eyes reached the sight of crowds, which was the mass of people queueing at the ticket gate... Our Disney feeling dropped drastically!  Is that all?  we asked each other... Come on, don't wish for Mickey and friends to get out, we cannot even see the castle or anything. And almost no food stalls around outside the ticket gate. That was real just it!If I knew it before, I wouldn't go out of the train station to save my Octopus balance...",0
"Not much to say, it's a nice park, nice to walk around and take in the atmosphere but other than that there is not much there for big kids. There were no looping rides and everything inside was too expensive (usual). Worth going for one day, you should be able to do everything you want within the day.",0
ill start by saying we visitred the ppk last week end which i appreciate was national holiday week end in france.  so obviously the place was crowded...  but the queues for the rides were exacerbated by the fact that many rides had cars not working 2 0r more on a lot of rides...think how much longer this makes the queue.....amazingly space mountain wasnt working !!!!! on holiday week end guys get real!!!! its one of the rides !!!! temple of doom ride broke down on sunday for over an hour the tram ride round back lot bvroke down etc now this is not good enough end of... also some restaurants in the pk were closed   disney whats happening you are losing your lustre   add in the daft prices for basic refreshments such as water and burger meals    makes this place unattractive   chessington in the uk offers much more to young visitors ...mum and dad find it less stressful and cheaper ...,0
"This is NOT the magical world that you enter as happens in the US parks...it's good but it's not magical. At the moment   July 2016   almost all of Fronteirland is closed. The area in front of the main gates is closed and boarded off, and the sword in the stone behind Sleeping Beauty's castle is also boarded up. Customer service in the shops is very very good   in other places it's sullen and, well....French..! Hot, busy, long queues, lots boarded up....",0
"Was really excited to visit EuroDisney and got a good deal on the two park one day it was cheaper than one day at WDW. Went to the Studios first   LOVED Rock N Roller Coaster!!. The ride is even better than the Walt Disney World one   actually lifted out of my seat. Had to ride it twice!! Also thought their Toy Solders Parachute drop looked cute. Studio Tram Tour was boring and the Tower of Terror looked too clean and new. I heard louder screams on the Toy Solders ride. There was only one restaurant open   it was a busy day and the restaurants are closed? Next off to Disneyland (e.g., Magic Kingdom in FL). Beautiful entrance and it was cool seeing another castle. Big Thunder Mountain was the only ride we enjoyed. Everything else was like a B version of the original.If you are a Disney fanatic like me, I was glad I had the opportunity to check it off my list since I've been to Paris a few times and thought my niece would enjoy it. I would not go out of my way to visit this unless you have small kids.Be ready for expensive food, but that's the standard at Disney.",0
"Our trip was May 9th   13th family of 5 (Wife, 4yr old daughter, myself and my parents)Arriving just after 2pm we checked into the hotel and returned back to the park just to have a look around before getting a full day in on the Friday. First impressions were good, the park is a good copy of the US parks (I've been to the one in California well over 20 times so I know it very well) After spending a couple of hours we returned to the hotel (Santa Fe) as my mum has trouble walking (uses a walker) we waited for the shuttle bus. This was our first taste of just how RUDE the Europeans can be (I don't want to point fingers but it's mainly the French) after the 15 minutes wait the amount of people wanting to get the bus was pretty big but we were at the front waiting in the disabled area so didn't think this would be a problem, how wrong can you be, we were pushed out of the way (me holding my 4yr old) my mum struggling to step into the bus, I just couldn't believe the people around us showing no respect for the less abled people. This was like it eveytime we used the shuttle, my mum dreaded using it if it was busy.Friday was our first full day in the park and the rudeness continued, what was worse it was coming from the Disney staff members. My mum decided to hire a wheelchair (50 euros a day, 150 euros deposit) she was told to go to city hall to get a pass which would allow her and one other member of the family to go on the rides at the exit. So went to city hall only to be told that she must provide proof that she is disabled, she's not officially disabled so she doesn't have a badge or letter from her doctor, so they refused to give her the pass. So if you   re thinking of hiring a wheelchair then make sure you have a letter from your doctor to get the pass.The rides are great although the Q times they advertise at the entrance you might as well double, 25 mins for peter pans flight turned into an hour. There was one thing that really made me mad and that was constant people smoking in the lines, the park operates a no smoking policy allowing 11 smoking areas around the park, the amount of times i had smoke blown in my direction, and it was clear the staff didn't care either.We left the park during the afternoon, when returning I was helping my daughter through the barriers, when me and my daughter were pushed aside by a member of staff so she could put through the tickets of a couple because their child was in a pushchair, there was no need to rush them through, they could have waited like everyone else, to say I was angry was an understatement, this is supposed to be a magical place yet so far I   ve been pushed around, treated like rubbish and being turned into a passive smoker. I was staring to realised if you can't beat them join them, so apart from taking up smoking i started treating people the same way as I was being treated, this seemed to work and the day got better. We wanted to watch the Disney Dreams show that started at 22:30 so found a good spot at 8pm and waited, by 21:30 people were trying to push their way in front of us even looking at me and shaking their heads because i wasn't letting them in front, you just have to be strong and stand your ground, the place is big enough so everyone can see the show. It was a great show on the castle and is a MUST see.Saturday we went into Disney studios (see other review) coming back into the park for dinner. Sunday was so much better, being a weekend I thought the park was going to be really busy but is wasn't if anything it seemed empty, we got to go on loads of rides and had a great day, my mum decided not to hire a wheelchair with all the hassle from last time and just used her walker, when we tried to go on some rides staff stopped her and asked for her pass, when we said city hall refused to give her one they called down to the operator on the ride who always gave her the ok for her to proceed, we got to do things as a family which we couldn't do on the Friday. The parades were great, 20 year anniversary every hour from midday (this is a little train that stops in front of the castle and all the characters get off and meet all the kids for 20 mins before getting back on and heading down main street USA) The other parade is at 7pm.To sum up, would I go back, only if I had to, I'm now looking at going to Disney in Florida, Paris is good but to have every ride in French, if you can't understand the language you   re just wondering what is going on. Yes sometimes you get the odd bit of English but it's not enough. Every now and then i thought this is just like the US Disney, but the French just killed it for me.I will go back one day, my daughter absolutely loved it and we did see a lot of characters, I would have rated it better if it wasn't for the rude staff and the people smoking everywhere, the park should police this more.TIPSBuy the meal vouchers when booking your holiday, food is expensive, the buffet meals cost 26 euros for adults and 13 for kids. If you do get the vouchers pick your restaurants and book a table as they will fill up fast, we booked our tables at the reception desk of our hotel. I got a great tip from trip advisor, I took an empty water bottle and just filled in up at any of the water fountains that can be found at the entrances to the toilets. Saved buying water or soft drinks and saved money.Take lots of spending money, the shops are fantastic, between the wife and daughter we nearly had to buy a new suitcase.",0
"Disappointed... Too many attractions closed. Food halls dirty and loads of flies. Some seriously rude staff. One women tried to up sell my daughter when she wanted a brioche and a drink for the offer price of 5.59   , she tried telling her she couldn't do it and she had to buy the expensive cup! We haven't been for ten years and it still felt like 'same old' no wow factor for us anymore even after so long. I think the quality of the food is disappointing. The French in my opinion just 'can't do Disney' Attitudes are poor, unenthusiastic, miserable! This is definitely our last time here, wouldn't waste our money. That said, for a 'first time experience'. It will still be ok. As long as you haven't experienced Florida, the true home of Disney! In my opinion.... Save up and go there!  ",0
"If you have been to the Disney parks in USA, expect this to be a very mini version of those. The rides are smaller as well. Unfortunately it was missing the splash mountain ride. :( Despite the size, still enjoyed ourselves. Do not miss the Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars ride, by far the best ride in the park.Disney is still the happiest place regardless of the size. :)",0
"I took my 3 boys (aged 10, 12 and 14) on a US road trip and Disneyland was our last stop before flying back to Perth, Australia. We only had 1 day so did the 2 park hopper (bloody expensive!) The park opened at 9 but was so disorganised   the line up for the security bag checks was crazy long and the gate we went through only had 2 people checking the bags so it took about 20 minutes  not good enough! Then the first ride we wanted to go on was not open yet which was unacceptable as they should have it ready before the gates open. The whold fast pass thing is a bit of a joke (but not funny!) Before 12 there were no more fast passes on anything we wanted to go on so had to line up for ages. We lined up for 40 minutes for the Mickey ferris wheel (although the wait time said 15minutes) then as we were about to get on it broke down. I asked the lady there if there was a pass system so we could be first in line when they fixed it but she said they dont do that. Great customer service. But there were positives   kids loved the rides and the fireworks and light show were awesome. Also the night parades with the amazing lights were an experience. The only issues there were the staff forcing everyone to squeeze into small roped off areas when the walkways (which were empty when the fireworks were on) were wide and could have accommodated lots more people. One female staff member was quite rude when I refused to move my children to a place where they couldnt see the fireworks or lights. Not the happiest place on Earth!",0
"Disneyland is one of the major attractions for Tourists visiting HongKong.However, it is very very expensive! Apart from that it is a heaven for kids!",0
"We visited the Disney resort for 2 days just before Christmas.First the positives. The Christmas decorations were very good, the Parades and rides were all good, the park is very clean as you   d expect. The negatives outweighed the positives however. Stay at a Disney hotel and get into the park at 8.30 instead of normal 10am opening time, the problem here is that most of the attractions don   t open until 10am so you might as well not bother. Half board vouchers for Disney restaurants, good look booking one if you don   t try 2 days in advance, a waste of time, we ended up eating elsewhere and paying the full price. The biggest problem however was the staff at Disney, I think most where absent when the Disney ethos was explained or they have a bad retention of instructions. I   d describe them as lacklustre and disinterested in the main, sometimes even rude, smiles were certainly in short supply. Disorganisation with the rides, certainly not what you   d expect from the Disney machine. In summary, it   s nothing like Disneyland Florida for the service and organisation. A bit of a let down for the prices paid.",0
"Disneyland itself is without a doubt a magical place! Starting on a positive, I really enjoyed when the castle lit up at night standing there looking out on it on the bridge with my boyfriend  very romantic, if it wasn't the fact it was the first time abroad with my man I don't think I would have seen it as such an adventure! We went on the trip with coach innovations  it was only   90 each for the trip and entry to park so we thought it would be worth it, however I must say it wasn't great! It rained all day, it was wet, cold, tiring weekend and the park just doesn't have enough shter   warm points  other than gift shops that are soooo expensive!! we only managed to get on the  finding nemo  ride which was an amazing ride  however we queued for 2 hours and were freezing! Staff didn't really seem friendly and were not many to be seen, didn't see anyone dressed up in character. The food really WAS NOT great!    20 for a burger and Chips   cold and inedible.Would maybe return in the summer  but even wrapped up it was unbearably freezing!Christmas parade was lovely! but not long enough.I think the fact we spent from 9am to 11pm was way too long !",0
"Having visited Disneyland Florida quite a few times which is exceptional, this park is a let down commercially and financially.Compared to florida this park is minuscule and when you have rides that are closed for maintenance which as Disney says  we are sorry that this ride is closed for essential maintenance and we hope it doesn't detract from your enjoyment etc etc .... .well yes it bloody does thank you .  Im only here for 4 days and I'm not coming back so yes it really pee me off .So now with the closure of Thunder mountain and Dumbo the park has lost its best rides so I may as well gone to Alton towers!You can go round the whole park in a day so to suffer 4 days going on the same rides was tedious to say the least, couple this with the rip off prices and you leave the park feeling as though you have been mugged literally.15 euros for a baseball cap, 8 euros for a slush puppie, etc. This wouldn't be so bad if you were on your own but when you have kids with you it soon starts to mount up.If you eat outside the park, apart from mcDees the prices are astronomical and to be honest you are in the middle of nowhere so you have to pay the going rate I'm afraid.I will be frank with you all out there, after you have paid for the trip and the food you may just as well go to the travel agent and go to florida for 2 weeks instead and I bet you the price difference will be negligible and you will enjoy USA much more than Paris. Bigger, Better and Cheaper",0
Coming with high expecations we were a bit disappointed with Disneyland Hong Kong. A few things really good but not as much Disney as we expected for instance there were very few characters out walking among the visitors. The food was really limited in selection and quality not good at all.,0
"While visiting Paris we thought it would be fun to experience Disneyland Paris being that we are big Disney fans. We were able to take the train from Paris which was about an hour and fifteen minute ride. We bought a day pass and were able to experience both parks in one day being that they are both very small. It was neat to see but it is not something that I would do again. Once you've experienced Disneyworld, this park just doesn't seem like much. If I had the to make the choice again, I probably would opt to take a train to London for an overnight instead.",0
"Easier to get in rides and photo with characters because queues are much shorter compare to the one in Japan. However, Disney staff at some eateries and cafes wasn't so friendly and look grumpy.. Overall still nice to visit hk Disney with kids because it's time saving and still consider a pleasant visit.. Had great fun too but do keep your eyes on your kids at all times. Oh ya, they give stickers to kiddies.. Definitely kids are happy with it.. ",0
"The merchandising is extensive and varied. You WILL find some great souvenirs. The Ratatouille ride experience was great, especially for fans of the movie like us. Although, the ride capacity was meagre and facilitated the length of queue.The all you can eat buffet was tasty, although hideously over priced despite only including one modest drink. These things leave a bad taste in the mouth. The gents toilets were flooded and the ladies toilets reeked of urine so badly my girlfriend was nearly sick because of the smell.The sets of buildings are immaculate but the site is intentionally confusing and the directional signage is almost non existent, and the theme park map isn't great. The point of this is to keep you wandering around aimlessly spending money, but it's cynical of the management.The Studios half of the park had some peculiar attractions to do with dated movies that I can't imagine many people would be interested in.The queuing system whereby you book a time to attend a ride was a good idea spoiled by the fact that it was not working available.The length of queues needs addressing. Either ride capacity needs to be greatly increased or numbers through the gates decreased, neither of which are likely to happen.Access to rides was often chaotic and confusing, with the public asking questions of the staff all the time because things were so unclear. Amazing really in an operator as experienced as Disney. The best part for me was the novelty Ratatouille chef's hat which I wore all day with pride and whimsey.",0
"I'm really glad we saw Disneyland Paris. I live in California and visit Disneyland California Adventure annually. So, when we decided to go to Paris, of course we had to check out Disney Paris.First of all, Downtown Disney is very small. They you can find currency exchange, Planet Hollywood, Starbucks (yeah), McDonald's with free wifi, Rainforest Cafe, a number of Disney stores, a few restaurants, and that's about it. Disney Studio is wonderful. I think we really enjoyed it because we have nothing to compare it to in California. I enjoyed the tour tram, the Toy Story section was awesome. Disneyland Paris had some unique items, but not many. I think there should be way more Disney Paris items than there were. I don't want to buy something I can buy at home. Very limited in merchandise of characters other than Mickey and Minnie. Thunder Mountain Railroad (our favorite at home) was closed in Paris yet again for a 2nd derailment in 6 months. It's a small park. Very few cast members, almost none. Very dark in some of the lands to the point of being a bit scary. Very few food offerings and extremely expensive at that. The biggest turn off were the restrooms. They were filthy and smelled of urine. Not at all to our Disney standard. The Disney hotels were beautiful.",0
"This park is tiny compared of course to Disney World. It is actually small compared to Disneyland in California. Whenever my friends come to see it they always talk about how small the castle seems. But, even though it is small it packs in some good attractions and good shows. Mystic Manor ride is pretty cool. Space mountain always is a thrill. Grizzly gulch has a fun roller coaster. And adventureland has some fun attractions. I haven't seen the new night parade yet, but I hear that it is one of the best things in the park now. You might want to check it out. ",0
Lower than expectation. I think it should be bigger. Big invest but feel incomplete. Little lovely place to visit.,0
"We visited at Christmastime 2015, was very crowded and 3 attractions broke down in the two days when we visited and almost all the attractions of the Wild West was closed. We had to queue for 45 minutes to 1 hour to each attraction. Considering the amount of money you pay as a family of 4 and although all in all the kids had a good time (but very very tiring with all the crowd) I don't think we will ever visit again.",0
"Visiting to Hong Kong Disneyland with family is a great experience. Despite the weather is not friendly that time, but we had so much fun in this place. It's great place to visit with entire family, my daughter is very happy with this present. It's surprise present for her birthday. For sure the queues its made us headache, but when we saw the show all the tiredness is gone.The parade was a good entertainment, but the most thing beautiful show is FIREWORK show. It's amaze all of us.For the food is very expensive, but nice food anyway..Overall we're happy to visit this place..",0
"In February there's a lot less people but anyway the fast pass is mandatory if you want to do more than 5 attraction in the day. The space mountain was in maintenance. So kids liked it, parents were there more for them that for the Parc. Tip: never do it's a small world twice in a row or you'll end the day with the music in your head. Lol",0
"I went to the HK Disneyland for a day with my family. If you've been to other parks, such as Paris, Anaheim, Orlando etc, it wont seem worth it in my opinion. If you have teenagers, i'd say over the age of ten, there may be 3 rides they'll really enjoy. There are many rides for small children though. The park is very small compared to the others. There are some good food stands and restaurants in the park. It is pretty well put together, and Main St. is amazing as in the other parks. Fireworks were great. I woud go on a monday or something, and off season is better as holidays and peak season its very busy. I would recommend this park for smaller children, but not nesecarilly for older kids.",0
"I visited both parks with my cousin and our boys, never again.There are no staff walking around the park, no information or assistance available in the park. You have to go to one of the rides to find a member of staff.The Disney characters were mainly in the Disney studios in the main park they were no where to be seen. You have to go to the little Hut things to see them the queen is like 50 minutes.Most of the rides in the main park for 5 year old and under were being refurbished and the wait for one ride was 75mins. If you have you children forgot fast track tickets as most of them do not take fast track tickets.Personally Disneyland paris is over rated and over priced. I would not be going back.They have a few good rides, my son aboustley enjoyed himself as long as his happy that's all that matters.",0
"Traveled with my wife for a half day visit. We had a character breakfast on Goofy's Kitchen Restaurant and it was amazing. Lots of Disney Characters came to our table for photos, hugs and autographs. Great food in a pleasant place.I wish I would return with my son some day.",0
"Long queues for everything food overpriced and not that good, I would recommend Victoria's on main street hot turkey sandwich was lovely but again overpriced. One thing I didn't know and I don't think many know that if you have a disability you can get a special pass to get you to the front of the queues which is a god send. Also paid to eat with the characters and not all of hem come to your table which is annoying. And the French are the most rudest arrogant people I have ever met.",0
"We were looking forward to our visit to Disneyland Paris, especially having been to Disneyworld Florida a few years ago. To say we were disappointed is putting it mildly. We were lucky enough to have wonderful weather. Our hotel The Santa Fe  was clean, comfortable and the staff were helpful. The rides were fun, the parade and fireworks were not to be missed, but where were the characters? It was not our idea of fun, to queue for up to two hours a day, to get a pass, that gave us a time to queue again for half an hour to spend five minutes with one princess. There were characters in Disney studios from 12.00 2.00, if you didn't mind the pushing and shoving to get your photo taken with the nearest character. The main reason for going to a Disney park are the characters, take them away and you have a moderate theme park. My advice is try to save the money and go to Florida.",0
"This is something to take into account as most of the attractions for kids 12  are not active at the moment.  Although the park is practically under major renovation ( including the park entry and ALL major attractions), they offer no discount to visitors.",0
"While in Paris my niece and I made a spur of the moment trip to Disneyland. I'd heard all of the jokes about how terrible it is   so our expectations weren't high. We had a nice time. My biggest complaint is the number of rides that weren't working or were being refurbished (Teacups, Pirates of the Carribean, Haunted Manor and several others I wasn't familiar with from the Orlando Park). There was also a general lack of customer satisfaction or  hustle  to get people through lines and onto rides quickly. Also disappointed with the photopass. I'm normally a sucker for the photopass at Disney or Universal. This one was $79, but there are only 6 rides that take photos and two of them are closed. Maybe it's worth it if you do a Princess breakfast. I would maybe go again if I was in Paris for two or more weeks  but it's not worth the trip if you've got limited time in Paris.",0
We had 4 day passes and only silent 1 day here ... Areas sectioned off for priority guests ... Again some characters we were denied access to because they were booked for special guests .... All money and queues .... Even after queuing for 2 hours to get a good spot to watch the parade was told it was cancelled due to light rain Absolutely rubbish unless you throw money at the place We were there 14 hours went on 3 rides didn't see any characters as quests too long or already fullParade cancelled so didn't watch that .... Got ripped off with drinks and paid nearly   5 for an ice creamFrozen show was good And the light show at 11 pm was goodBut overall disappointed ... Very tiring .. Very expensive .. And unless you are priority guests? RubbishStudios better for us ,0
"So it took us a long journey to get to this place, our girl was diagnosed with leukaemia back in 2013 at the tender age of 2.5yo and we promised when she finished treatment we would take her to the happiest place on earth, well most of the staff were grumpy, the evil queen and Pluto made up for it, they played their character exceptionally. You certainly need 3 days to get around and even then we missed parts. Highly recommend the fireworks, didnt get to see the parade as it was cancelled. Highly recommend Astro Orbitor, Mark Twain Riverboat, Sailing ship Columbia, Blue Bayou Restaurant, Big thunder Mountain Railroad and Matterhorn bobsleds although this ride is very riggetty and not great if you have a back issue!! It was fun to see the characters although got a little over having to que on day 3. Mikey made a fuss which was awesome and even hugged our girls pink seahorse called snugglebum whom has been by her side through treatment, now that brought a tear!! Loved disneyland railroad and Tarzans treehouse. I guess the expectation was too high and in parts was disappointing, maybe a little overwhelming too. The amount of people didnt really bother us and it was great to people watch, wish it could have been more.",0
"If you haven't been to a Disney Park before, and wanted to live the experience for maximum 2 days, then this is the place for you. Although this is the smallest Disney Park, it still has the samemajic and charm found in the other Parks.The rides in the Park are good for the kids (4 years and above),and adults can still enjoy few rides (space mountain, grizzly gulch and couple in Toy StoryLand). The good thing about the Park is that staff are very friendly, very neat and clean, and has a  Halal Food  restaurant that could be enjoyed by muslim travellers. I found this Park little cheaper than EuroDisney, especially in the entrance fees and Disney shops.They have a limited number of shows, and I managed to enter the  Lion King Festival  which found to be very entertaining and amazing.Depending on the season, either one or two parades are made during sunlight, and at night they do not have a night parade, but fireworks show, They do close some parts of the Park early as a safety precaution for the fireworks show. I would recommend this Park for travellers going through Hong Kong for a short time transit, but more than 2 days for this Park is not required.",0
"We very nearly didn't go as we are not major Disney fans and found the cost a little hard to swallow. However, we decided it was now or never as our children were 10 and 14. Have to say that this was the best move as they could go on all the big rides, were mature enough to queue without any moaning and were able to walk and stand around for pretty much 14 hours a day without a tantrum or need of a buggy. If they were young the park would be over priced as the tame rides are similar to fair ground rides and really not worth a 30 45 minute wait. The new Ratatouille ride was great fun but had queues of 120 minutes !!!! We came back at 8pm and went on twice within 15 mins. The Dreams show at 10pm was fabulous, Guy Fawkes night won't be the same after that! But again at 10pm , a little late for little ones. We found water fountains all over the park and used the tea time treat vouchers we got with the half board deal for extra drinks and snacks. Food is otherwise very expensive, 14 euros for a burger meal, 7 euros for a pint of lager. Even McDonalds charges Disney prices. Having said all of this, it was fun but for us, a one off.I would like to score it  good  but there is no option!",0
"We spent 2 days here and with very few exceptions (night fireworks spectacle, characters parade) most of the attractions are usual ones, but with very long expectation lines. The carousel is a 40 seconds ride, for which one expects at least 10 minutes. The house of Pinocchio and the one of Snow white were quite scary for my 3 1 2 years daughter. She liked the castle, the tea cups, a small world, dumbo (where again the expecting lines were incredibly long). Generally, i had the impression that the staff was either not really efficient, or they were acting on purpose to create expecting lines even when there were not so many folks (by letting cars   ships   wagons empty without an explanation). Everything, and I really mean everything is considerably more expensive than in the real world   outside of the parks,",0
"After the first time I vowed never to come back, but a friend suggested to go with our sons so there I went again. Like the first time I was surprised by the small size. Actually when there are no very long rows youre done at three o clock. The food is terrible. In my opinion its very over rated. Its nothing compared to de Efteling in the Netherlands where its much more fairylike, much more attractions, cheaper and shorter waiting lines. It was being with friends that made the day.",0
"We went on thursday and friday and we managed to do the Space Mountain twice with a waiting time of only 5 minutes     use the extra magic hours between 8 and 10. It was our sixth time, last time in 2006. Only one new attraction al the rest is still the same. We missed the magic feeling, the staff don't smile that much any more... We have since then seen much better parks in het USA but also the Eurapapark in Germany.",0
After 500 dollars in entry fee for the family it is really disappointing to be in a queue for two hours and then be told the ride has technical issues not just on one ride of cars but also on grizzly mountain   after such a great visit 2yrs ago I am disappointed. Expensive and under delivered won't be going back ,0
"besides the ticketsbeing high, their food is blan and is expensive.",0
"We were really excited at the prospect of taking our 2 year old daughter to Disneyland Paris. When you walk in and see the Castle, it's pretty impressive. But after two days of queuing and over priced junk food, you start to wish you had gone to Center Parcs or Alton Towers instead. We spent 2 hours, (no exaggeration), queuing to see a Disney Princess. We were so disappointed at the lack of characters wandering around the Disneyland Park. The rides were dated and very short   particularly disappointing when you've waited in line with a 2 year old for nearly an hour. The parade was nice and the castle show was fantastic. We're glad we've been and seen it for ourselves and we're sure this review won't stop others from wanting to go and experience the  magic  for themselves. However, be aware that you will queue and you may come away from it slightly disappointed and definitely a lot lighter in the wallet department!",0
I am afraid having been to Florida and L A quite a few times DLP staff need to take a leaf out of their colleagues the Disney smile had all but gone some staff quite unhelpful.Perhaps they had the Xmas blues.This did not spoil our...More,0
We booked a while ago and were not warned that half the park was being renovated. This meant that with young children there are no rides in frontier and adventure land that they could go on. The consequence for this was mad long question in fantasy and discovery land. The fast pass system is rubbish compared to Florida and there is no frozen much to my 3 year olds sadness. There is only a bit in the 5.30 parade. If this is what you want then safe that bit more and go to Florida.Sorry Disney but I feel really let down. It's not cheap to stay and visit you and I feel very short changed.My advice would be check what's open and on if you decide Disneyland Paris is for you. ,0
"A good park to visit to experience a day in Disney, however it isn't as good as the one in the US, and it is allot smaller. The park itself is relatively expensive, something that you would expect in a theme park. There is allot of attention to detail in the park. including the rides. Would recommend to any Disney fans.",0
"We live on the east coast and have been to Disneyworld several times, mainly due to its closer proximity. We wanted to spend a day in Disneyland for comparison. Both parks have superb shuttle service and staffing. Disneyworld is much grander, with a huge castle, larger park, and many more attractions. However, there were more dining options within the Disneyland Magic Kingdom.Our main disappointment was the number of broken rides. At various times of day the following rides were down: Thunder Mountain, Space Mountain, Pirates of the Caribbean, Alice in Wonderland, and a few rides for younger kids. Lines at the other rides were expectedly much longer than normal.Disneyland is a special place but overall it pales in comparison to Disneyworld. If you have been the latter resort I would not waste my time going to the former.",0
"Visited both parks August 2014 Vastly overcrowded, but I guess it's the summer holidays, can't complain too much..... By lunchtime all fast passes for all rides were done with.. Advertised queue times on some rides quite inaccurate by about 30mins to the worse!Rides we went on were great though! Space mountain, small world, dumbo, Indiana jones, star tours.... EtcToilets, frankly every one used throughout the day was disgusting and not up to cleanliness standards of other parks (eg disney Florida, universal). Graffiti, paper all over floor, blocked toilets... Stay away from Annette's diner. Food was overpriced, average and there was nothing 'fast' about this fast food diner :(Overall   the kids enjoyed it, but I think we'll go to the Florida one next time...",0
"We visited on the last day of the  medium  season, and I was really annoyed. Most of the good rides (e.g. roller coasters) were closed!Of course they would all open the next day, when it was High Season!The one roller coaster that was open had a 75 minute wait. This is not practical with kids. And the Fastpass was useless because all available slots were immediately booked up. It really depends what you want out of Disneyland Park ....If you want Disney ness then its great.If you want a theme park, go somewhere else! (For example, GardaLand in Italy is FAR better)Some negative notes: * Parking is expensive* Closed rides* Most of the character based attractions are outdated   my kids had no idea who most of the character were. E.g. Indiana Jones, Captain Nemo, Pirates of the Caribbean, Alice in wonderland, Dumbo ... Some positive notes: * Its spotless!* The food in the restaurants is quite good and not that expensive!* The fireworks show at the end was fantastic!* It's relatively good value ... esp when compared to a themepark where you have to pay for each ride!Some hints: * Bring lots of drinks ... the drinks are very expensive ... food is not too expensive.* Good shoes! Lots of walking* Get there early, but pace yourself. The queues disappear a couple of hours before closing. Do the good rides then, but don't be too tired by then : )* The fireworks show is just amazing!",0
VERY over crowded!!! Need more than one day to ride all the rides. Nice lockers and picnic area hidden right outside gates.,0
"Having never been to Disneyland before I think I just expected it to be bigger and grander. I think if I was 5 years old then I would have thought it was amazing. It looks a bit aged but they are obviously doing work on things as Sleeping beauty   s castle and a few other things were all closed for renovations. It   s not cheap but not overly expensive either. The rides we did go on were great and the street parade was fun. We got there at 10am opening and had walked the park and were done by 1:30 and had ridden a few rides, there really isn   t that many. We went on a Monday so didn   t have the massive queues either. I think if we had gone when our kids were young we probably would have enjoyed it more it certainly is a place for small children. ",0
"We staked out a spot in the roped out area near the castle for hours prior to countdown. at about 10 PM tons of rude people started to squeeze themselves into the crowd. One couple even started a fight because they were rude to the people who waited from 6 AM to save their space. Security came but didn't even dare to remove that rude couple from the park, so that really ruined our mood.While standing there, our friends messaged us and asked if we saw One Republic performed. It turned out the One Republic performance was prerecorded a long time ago, and it was dubbed into the live broadcast to make it look like it was live. Shame on Disney for faking this kind of broadcasts.All we had for NYE was a DJ the whole night. The fog came in so thick that we couldn't even see the fireworks.I would not return to Disneyland for NYE count down for these reasons:1. Lack of live entertainment2. Poor crowd control3. Incompetent security crew4. Simply unsafe for young children",0
"It can't be the happiest place on earth if it's filled with pushing shoving tourists and crowd. The queues were horrific and there was no management of the queues. The crowd was jumping queue, queuing for a family of 14, and, ill mannered. It made for a negative experience all round. The food was expensive and the restaurant areas were not properly maintained. By that I mean that it was not cleared up fast enough to manage the throngs coming into the restaurants. Needs crowd control, more affordable restaurants with ample seating and more expansive menus. ",0
"I just don't get why everyone gushes over Disneyland. It is extremely expensive and the most of the rides seem like Chucky Cheese on steroids. Maybe I'm jaded but to wait over 30 minutes to see Pirates of the Carribean??? And I have heard that the line ups were not that long as usual. My two year old was too young and nine year old almost too old. Seems that 5 8 is the perfect age as my nine year old only liked a handful of rides like the Roller Coasters and Indiana Jones. Many of the best rides were closed, Splash Mountain, Matterhorn, Soaring over California and Grizzly River. Do they have to close all the best rides at once? Although many people that have been told be Matterhorn and Splash were not that great. I think my nine year old would have enjoyed Six Flags better and the longest line ups were for the little kiddie rides like Dumbo which lasts one minute!!! Don't think I will go again for another 30 years, maybe with the Grandkids:)",0
"I recently moved to SoCal and bought one of the annual passports. My family are fans of Disney and we have have a good time on multiple visits to Orlando and on a Disney cruise. So, when we moved to the greater LA area, we couldn't pass up an annual membership. However, it turns out we have only used our pass a few days this year  barely worth buying the pass. You see, the park itself seems much more crowded than Orlando because it has much of the same rides attractions but they are compressed into a smaller area. In addition, they don't offer the waterparks, which are a nice diversion on hot days in Florida. The kids enjoy visiting, but I can barely tolerate it, so I don't think I'll be renewing my pass next year.",0
"It may have not been a good year (or probably month) to visit because they're renovating the place and there are lots of attractions that are closed when we were there 2 weeks ago. They also hiked up the ticket price starting January 2018.During our stay, 2 of the attractions that we went to malfunctioned so they had to close it for about an hour or so. Picture taking with Mickey & Minnie also have specific timings and they cut it short very early (around 4:00 or 4:30 PM). I could be wrong but I don't remember them closing it before 4PM on my previous visits few years ago.Don't get me wrong.... Disneyland is still a very fun place to visit in Hong Kong. Parade of the Stars is still one of my favorite events there. Always fun to see the Disney characters. I would still recommend to visit it specially if you have children who loves to go to theme parks.",0
"Queues were horrendous, quite a few rides were closed, food was horrendous and v expensive. All in all, not a good day!",0
Compared to the US Disney parks you may be disappointed with this Asian offering. Only two  big rides  and 50 minute queues in buildings with little ventilation .The majority of the park is retail outlets and food halls and the park is kept very clean . Overall although enjoyable a little underwhelming .,0
"It's Disneyland! A happy place to be. Rides are not very exciting. Universal Studio was much more fun. Everything in there is super expensive. Food could cost USD30 40 for a simple set meal of rice, chicken and cola. Doesn't even taste nice. Should stick with fried snacks and hotdogs.",0
"I have just spent the day with my family at HK Disneyland, and my overall impression of the place was average. I was staying in Hong Kong for a few days, and deliberately delayed my visit to Disneyland till the Monday to avoid the crowds. However, that didn't seem to help much.Having visited Universal Studios Singapore a few times, I would say that Disneyland Hong Kong is not as good. Universal sells a Fastpass which allows you to skip the queues on all the rides for an additional fee, however, the Disney Fastpass is only available for 2 rides, and works somewhat differently.The average wait time per attraction was 40 60 mins, and the park seemed to be bursting at the seams. Waiting 1 hour with 2 small kids for a 3 minute ride is not fun. The park itself is not massive and can be easily completed in one day. The food at the park is very expensive and the quality is not great. Hong Kong Disneyland is one of those theme parks that you will visit once on a holiday to Hong Kong, but it's not one of those places you would return to in a hurry.",0
"I've been 3 times to Disney, it's looking a little jaded now. I really wish they had a no smoking policy too, the place is littered with cigarette ends ... And not great to see the staff openly smoking!",0
"We just visited on 1 27 17 and experienced the majority of the rides kept breaking down. There were SO many people there during the  off season  and yet with so limited rides that were actually running, the lines were 60  minutes for everything. There were so many strollers everywhere, it was really difficult to get anywhere. I wish Disney would figure our some better crowd control options to help the flow around the park. The park itself was clean and magical. It's frustrating to pay almost $800 for a family of four (2 day pass) to have the majority of rides keep breaking down. Feels like someone's pockets are getting bigger and that money isn't being put back into the park for maintenance and customer satisfaction. I feel like Mr. Disney would be disappointed if he were alive to hear this experience. ",0
"Is it really worth a special visit? I visited the park 4 times, when it first opened, and an average of every 2 years after that and I admit that there has always been a magical, indescribably Disney speckle, but Hong Kong Disneyland is not that special when compared with the other Disney parks. Space mountain is always a hit, Toy Story land is cute, and Main Street USA is always quaint, but I find it very problematic how Disney did not exploit its chances with incorporating Hong Kong's flare into its characters attractions. It is quite cute when Minnie Mouse dresses up in traditional qipao and also a nice surprise when the space cafe serves cha siu burgers but these feel so obvious...Tourists and happy little kids are everywhere, they make you feel like a big kid at heart but, you are better off going to Ocean Park where there are more attractions and specifically, ones that are more specific to local culture, natural site and history. Disneyland is quintessentially American, and if you want that authenticity, go to the Disney parks in Florida. Pastiche ofSelection of American parks mashed into small and pricey real estate Admit that I am coming",0
"If you measure DLP vs Orlando you will be continually disappointed but if you accept that it is a smaller, less organised and less varied than the US version thne its fine. 2 parks Disneyland and Disney Studios, instead of 5 (albeit the Park site has 4 or 5 different  areas    adventureland, frontierland, fantasy land, etc.) and therefore lessw alking to cover it all, but it's quicker to run out of things to do and you end up doing Space Mountain 2 or 3 times at the end of the day when queues are down to 5 mins.The Magic hours for disney hotel residents are pretty restricted with 2 hours from 8am and only 2 areas of the park open, and not all the rides in those areas.The Buffalo Bill show is worth doing (in the context of everything at Disney being extortionately expensive). The Car stunt show is worth doing (identical to the US one though, if you've already seen it). All the big rides are as good as in the US   there's just not as many of them. The fastpass system gets used up pretty quickly and Crush's Coaster is good but DO NOT queue 90mins for it! Oh yes   one other difference from US. At DLP if the queue time says 30 mins its 45   in US if it says 30 its actually 20.We did 3 &1 2 days at DLP including a daytrip into Paris to see Eiffell Tower (climded the stairs to level2) Notre Dame and The Louvre   nice day out. My kids (14,11,8) had had enough at the end (ie 2 & 1 2 days at DLP) which kind of sums it up: nice for a quick fix, but be realistic in your expectations.",0
"We went to Disneyland with our daughter. Some aspects of it were magnificent. The parade was excellent and the park closing show was stunning. However the hard work was let down by some basic stuff. We went in the week during February, so defiantly not peak periods yet the park seemed unable to cope with the people. We queued for so many things and often felt like cattle in a market. But also I think they seemed to loose the magic in some ways. We can go on similar rides in most theme parks through the world but our kids (and us) want to see the Disney characters. You could queue up for ages (75 mins to see a princess because there was only 1 in there!!!!?) but why doesn't the park have people dressed as princesses, or Goofy, Micky etc just walking around. That personal touch is the difference between us coming back again or not. I don't want more rides, I want Disney magic.",0
"Im sorry, but I just don't understand the hype. Unfortunately, we went here with a 5 year old and 10 month old in the middle of peak season. In 5 hours we managed pretty much all that Tommorow Land had to offer ( but 3 of its atractions were closed) and one attraction in Frontier Land before we had had enough. The crowds, the 2 hour wait for a 90 second ride and the unrelenting heat ruined our magical day and to top it off, the fluke encounter with Mickey Mouse never turned up on our photo pass!!! I know that it is a must, but our 5 year old preferred Disney California Adventure Park (DCAP).On the plus side, the fast passes were much more available at Disneyland than DCAP and Star tours is a good ride.",0
"During a recent trip to Disneyland for the most part it was a good experience with the exception of a few park personnel. Parade director were rude, almost to the point of pushy, and at the area where kids can be scanned and armored like Iron Man the attendant was very abrupt, the start of the line was unmarked and those in line were sitting on the floor for how slow things were going.Also, for having to pay almost 100 a person to get in the park, 52 dollars for 3 people to eat (a sandwich and doodle salad) is a bit high.",0
"Going for new year it wasn't quite as cold in the day as expected and the rain held off.Due to annual passes Disneyland was very, very busy and at times crowding became dangerous when leaving the park.Staff were on the whole friendly, unlike many of the rude patriots. I didn't enjoy the smoke anywhere but restaurants and ride queues as my kids were continuingly enhaling secondhand smoke. The park was clean however and food as expected, but no soft drinks other than water for kids  we took our own.We didn't manage to get on all the rides attractions due to queues (meet princesses 4hours) and bug thunder mounting having two days of technical difficulties.Those we did go on were enjoyable and the parade was fantastic, as was the light show.Not sure if I will return to Paris again, but viewed this trip as a  warm up  for Florida. ",0
"Visited with my 13 year old daughter. The last time I visited was 14 years ago with my then 7 year old daughter. I must say that nothing has improved in that time, i expected the place to have modernised at least  installation of charging ports for example as techonology has advcanced and people now need their phones, tablets to do everything, including taking pictures, but I noted it was exactly the same as 14 years ago. Also, most people that work at the place did not understand a word of English. This is surprising considering that people visits from all over the world! My daughter and i spent a good part of 10 minutes trying to explain to the cashier staff about the pictures we wanted to buy at Mickey mouse stand as she could not understand us!All in all good but the place needs to improve and staff trained well to understand English.",0
"I booked a 2br suite for $1600 a night, crazy as it seems. The  Suite  was basically a 1 br with a door opening up into another seperate room. Additionally for the $1600, I got a room right next to the Monorail....nothing like hearing that thing going by every 5 minutes or so....NEVER AGAIN!",0
"The best ride of this park was Space Mountain. It's the only  thrill ride . The entire park is well done per Disney standards, but the planned expansion will add greatly to the feel of the park.  The food options are execellent.",0
"Overall fairly disappointed with the park. Some areas not well kept. eg. on exiting it's a small world the lawned areas had not been cut and full of weeds. ( just an observation) The days we were there the parks felt almost over crowded. In the Studios in particular many of the eating places were closed. There were long queues even for the ladies toilets. In the men's toilets there were at least 6 ladies in front of me in line to use them. Most of the toilets I used were dreadful and not being maintained. ( have seen better standards in porta loos at a pop festival !!We queued for ages even for some of the smallest of rides for the young children 30   40 minfor a 90 second roundabout ride. Most of the larger rides were at least an hour and a half.Even 10 min. after the official opening time there was a 2 hour wait for the tower of terror.We made the most of our time, but it was not the magical experience we had hoped for our two young grand children's first Disney visit. Unlike our first visit with our own daughter to Florida many years ago, which was near perfect and we always remember fondly. We have been back to Florida on 5 occasions and the standards are always high.One final warning, seems if you are carrying anything other than a Disney carrier bag ...beware!at 11o'clock at night, after 13 hours in the park with two young and very tired children. As we were leaving, we were dragged out of the madding crowd just outside the park by security and hauled to one side and being demanded to produce receipts for every item we had purchased in in park. (almost all children's toys) Even the hats our grandsons had on their heads. Much of which we had purchased the day before, with the receipts being back at the hotel.When we asked why with literally thousands and thousands of other people pushing past us at that very moment all rushing to get to their buses and cars, most dressed up in hats and ears and ...... well you get the picture! Why we were pulled over (and this guy was trying to look in our bags as well) We were advised it was because one of our carrier bags was one the we had brought with us and not an official Disney carrier bag!!!!! I am a very patient person but believe me, it would have been well worth the assault charge to deck the brainless jobsworth.When he saw how angry he was making us he backed off.What a way to totally kill what had been a very frustrating day anyway.Disneyland Paris really just do not have it right and are doing the magic of Disney no good at all.",0
"The heat, crowded, long lines for everything! It was my first time there with our family & probably last. Tickets are way overpriced for the amount of rides you're able to go on due to the long lines. Even fast pass lines were long to get tickets to come back at a later time during the day.",0
ok I wont  pay that much again I was not worth it.............................,0
"I regret not getting the 2 day pass as one day is not enough in trying all the attractions in Disney, especially if you come on a weekend. we met a few uncouth dancers, who allowed some European guests to take a pic with her but refused us. the queues to take a picture with the Disney characters are usually jam packed.",0
"Not as great at the American Disney's, but this was expected. Quite affordable in comparison though. The staff were amazing and very helpful, but I would recommend visiting any other time than in the Summer. It was too hard to line up with a 3 and 7 year old in the heat (which was 32 degrees celcius, but felt like 42c according to the app). The sprinkler system's which are at every amusement park in America, should definitely be introduced here, as we ended up missing out on a lot of rides, as the wait was too long.The parade was great   but really that was the only thing that made it feel really 'Disney'.",0
"This is the second time I have visited Disneyland Paris. This park is now 20 years old and it it showing its age. Water fountains not working, ponds with no water, paint pealing and just the look of an ageing park. Don't get me wrong but this is still a fun place to go, but in comparison to Disneyland California which is now almost 60 years old, this is starting to look run down. I also find that the organisational skills at almost every attraction is very poor. I am not blaming the staff but the supervisors and more importantly the management. There are the odd members of staff that look totally bored with what they are doing, perhaps they need to be weeded out and more enthusiastic staff employed. The number of attractions that have  breakdowns  which turn out to be lack of staff is very noticeable. Time for the senior management to wake up and see what is going on. There are a lot of good staff being badly let down by the supervision. As I said earlier still a fun place to go but could do better.My biggest gripe, and I know I'll end up with a lot of stick for this, but this is a park full of children and the number of people smoking throughout the park I feel is irresponsible. This needs to become a smoke free zone. Have smoking areas not the whole park.",0
"I feel a little unfair giving this place only a    3 star    rating. I   ve been to WDW 6 times, the missus has been to WDW 19 times and we tried to enjoy Disneyland Paris for what it is, but couldn   t. There wasn   t the same magic, the same atmosphere or the same sensation walking around WDW in Florida gives me or the missus for that matter. We were initially very excited to be going but after an hour the excitement dwindled and it was just like being at any other theme park. Don   t get me wrong, we did enjoy our time there and the rides we went on, but it just lacked something we enjoy about FL. I   ve found a number of the    cast members    to be rude and abrupt, the smiles on the faces of their Floridian counterparts weren   t there, the happy smiling, Mickey Glove waving cast members that they are weren   t to be seen amongst the French cast members. On the plus side, I got to go on the Peter Pan ride here as the queue for that in WDW is usually 90mins plus.The food is overpriced   and some! But on the plus side, the food is vastly superior to food in WDW, but still needlessly overpriced. The coffee cup size you get for    3.69 is not even what I   d consider    small    and for the first time in my life, I didn   t have the    ump when it was time to come home. I enjoyed the    steampunk    look to Discoveryland (where Tomorrowland is in WDW) and walking through the Nautilus was very interesting. I will return, but I   m in no rush to do so. ",0
"This was our big day out for the kids this summer. It started out well as we arrived as soon as it opened and the queues were reasonable. The kids were in awe of the whole place. My son (aged 10) went on the Indiana Jones ride and has not stopped talking about it since and my younger daughter loved the rides she went on. However, as the day went on the queues became ridiculous and nobody wanted to stand for 1 hour and 20 minutes for a ride. In the end we decided we would for Big Thunder Mountain and we were nearly on the ride when they ran into technical problems and just told everyone to leave. No apology and no fast passes to compensate those who had already queued for a long time. Although fast passes would have been no good to us as the ride never got going again during the time we were there, we felt the customer service could have been better. The other issue we had was the time it took to to get served at one of the fast food joints. 20 minutes it took to get served with chicken bugers, chips and soft drinks and there was only a few people ahead of me in the queue. My husband suggested that the fast food outlet should display waiting times in the same way the rides did. The highlight of the day for my daughter (aged 6) was the parade which was excellent. We did go in August and there are more visitors to the park than when we went in August 15 years ago. My advise to anyone would be to avoid the summer months and go at a quieter time of year if you can.",0
"Visited here with family and it was great fun! But since we visited in June, the heat was scorching and very tiring to stand in long queues for every ride. Each ride took us atleast 40 45 mins in queue and the ride was just for 10 mins, so plan your trip in off season! The rides were fun and DO NOT MISS the parade!There is a lot for older kids and adults too. Visit the roller coaster in the dark. Dont remember the name now.",0
"This is very close to the train station, probably only a 10 minute walk at the most, and you walk underneath the pink Disneyland Hotel to get in. We visited in October, so the park was decorated for Halloween. Unfortunately, a lot of the rides were closed for repair, and the majority of the rest had long queues. As we were staying at the nearby Newport Bay Hotel, we had access to Disney Magic Hours, which allowed us entrance between 8   10 am. This sounded great, but only two of the lands were open, and then not all the rides. Also, we exited Discovery Land to have our pictures taken with Chip and Dale, and then they wouldn't let us back in, and we had to join another long queue to get back in after 10am. Then, just like Hollywood Studios, there was more lines to even get a Fast Pass, We couldn't help comparing to Florida, where you seem to be able to get on a lot more rides, with less hassle. There is also a smoking ban, but the staff seemed scared to stop anybody, and people were walking around, and in the queues, smoking away. The shops are very good though, and there is a closed walkway behind them on both sides of Main Street, with some nice seating, where you can rest and get away from any bad weather.",0
Fairly small Disney park that has only 3 or 4 rides for older kids. This park is best for families with kids under about 10 years of age. Fireworks at end of day were a highlight. Park is open long hours so one day is enough if you are prepared to have a full day. Costs quite a lot more than Ocean Park and not as good. Trades off the Disney name. ,0
We did make the best of it but was not expecting an overly crowded park!Thanks to the fast pass program we were able to ride a few rides that didn't take 55 & 70 mins to wait in line for!The decor was Pumpkin Fall Fabulous & the staff were fabulous!It was disappointing when the show you want to see gets cancelled 3x for technical reasons but I guess it gives you a reason to go back!,0
"Mmmm, I think point form will the best way to review1   one would think that if they are not having fireworks at the end of the night because they only do it on weekends this time of the year, the entrance price should be reduced, quite a let down as we thought there would be fireworks and waited around after a volunteer said there would be fireworks, only that we noticed everyone was heading for the exit at the end of the night.2   refreshments and food is WAY overpriced, there is no need for it, profits can still be made without greed getting in the way.3   the staff are friendly considering they deal with lots of people,..... although I was having a photo with my children at the entrance and they were sitting on and I was leaning against the 3 foot brick wall with the fence and Mickey garden behind us and a staff member volunteer walked pass and asked me to get the children off the wall because  this is earth quake country and if we have one the wall would fall and cause an injury ............I'm sorry ,...what ????4   We have done it, but wont rush back, did have fun.5   It was clean and well maintained.6   Becareful as it is earthquake country and anything could be dangerous, including going to the toilet.7   You will make of it for what it is to you.",0
"I gave been fortunate enough to go to Florida on several occasions, this was not a good thing when embarking on a break at Disney Paris. There is no magic. I never realised it is the staff that give it the magic but with the French counterparts being arrogant, rude and totally un  customer focased I realise it's the staff that make it great. The rides are good the park is lively and has all the Disney bits but half of the rides seem to be closed at different times for no apparent reason. The food kiosks are 95%closed. The restaurants lack any atmosphere. When you find one open. The guest are wandering with cigarettes and cans of beer. There are tramps at the entrance trying to get money doing sketches. The travellators from the car parks are not working half the time for no reason. We enjoyed the rides but not the park and I do feel if we could not compare the two parks we would still have found things lacking but not really noticed the staff issues. Disney is a brand that I thought would be the same worldwide but this has priced to be wrong. ",0
"We have just returned from our trip to Disneyland over the weekend and the weather at noon time was HOT. For those travelling with young children you might wanna bring a hat for them (or even an umbrella). Use your FAST pass if possible to avoid queuing in the hot sun.Most of the rides were suitable for a 3 year old (except those at tomorrowland). Photo taking with Mickey and friends was available all day long (but you have to QUEUE). We were disappointed that there weren't many nice spots for phototaking compared to the one in Tokyo (where you could even go into Minnie's house) where each and every corner was kawaii. Food was expensive! Be prepared to pay at least HKD135 for a set meal. To avoid the crowds at lunch time you may want to go earlier eg at 1130am or 130pm.The street parade started at about 730pm. You'll have to gather early around the main street area if you want to get a good spot to take photographs. It's about 40 minutes so there might be nothing much to do thereafter (if you want to wait to catch the fireworks at 9pm), especially if the kids are already tired after a long day. ",0
"The park is cute, but not my favorite Disney Park. My top 3 are Disneyland (original), Tokyo Disney Sea, Epcot Center. This was cute and all the rides are in French, but a lot of areas were down for refurbishment so didn't take us long to get through with the park.",0
"We have always enjoyed our visits and not having been for 5 years booked 6 days. We were all surprised at the way standards had dropped and the professionalism we had come to expect was not evident.Toilets were dirty, restaurants had food on tables and floors even after cleaning, major rides were closed unexpectedly due to maintenance issues to name a few problems.We queued for the new Ratatouille ride for an hour ( minimum wait 120 minutes) even though the staff knew it had stopped working. No information given so we gave up.Thunder Mountain was closed unexpectedly   no information, inaccurate waiting times announced for many rides so queued for one ride expecting a 30 min wait and gave up after 60mins, early hours for Disney hotel visitors was not worth it as few rides open with lengthy queues.I have always loved our visits and just hope that the management deal with all of this   it is in their control to make this a magical experience again.",0
"Went there on a works triip myself & 3 children (two aged 10 & a 16 yo), stayed at Newport Bay Hotel for 3 nights in early November. We had a reduced rate so the trip was good value would have cost twice as much if i had booked it myself, a rip off. I had been there before & it seemed to me little had changed in 10 years, perhaps that's why visitors are down. Positives: kids had a great time & loved the rides, the new Ratatouille ride is fantastic & Tower of Terror was a hit. Also, kIds loved the coasters Space Mountain, Crush & Aerosmith. Stitch live was a unexpectedly good laugh to. Hotel was good, rooms clean & beds comfy, but no tea or coffee facilities in room ;0(, continental style breakfast was included. Park was very quiet & so we went on all the rides without any delays & only used the fastrack service once for ratatouille ride. Also, the dream show on the castle should not be missed very spectacular. Negatives: food is extortionately expensive & mostly crap, went to rainforest restaurant & was really disappointed, it had definitely gone downhill since the last time i was there. A friend said they had gone to the Lord sandwich bar & enjoyed it, but the kids were happy with McDonalds (as usual). I just grabbed some stuff from the breakfast bar on the second day & took it in the park with me as did a lot of other people to save some cash. Beer also extortionate so didn't bother even having a pint. I would go there again for the kids, but i would take a cooler bag full of food & drink for them, unless you have won the lottery.",0
We went during October thinking it might be less busy then the summer months but it was insanely busy. However all the Halloween decorations were fun to look at.,0
"Tomorrowland pretty much sums up Disneyland in 2019; a nostalgic vision of a future that has been left behind by reality.Our second visit in 20 years found us fumbling with apps that have poor usability, rides that lack the    wow    factor of neighbouring parks and outrageous prices for food and drink...and wait times in holding pens that afford no interactivity other than the horrendously poor guest wi fi that doesn   t even have full park coverage.Space Mountain, at over 90 minutes wait time on a good day is no longer a    bucket list    ride. And many of other once iconic attractions lack the polish and sophistication of other parks. Save your time, dump the kids in Disneyland and head on over to Adventureland Park. It   s still the same crappy app but at least Guardians, Cars and the Incredicoaster are worth the wait times.",0
"Our overall experience can be described as mixed feelings of disappointment and fun. It is better not to make comparisons between Anaheim Disneyland and this place because the former would defeat Euro Disney in every aspect. This place is much more expensive than its American counterpart, more crowded, smaller and less professional. At least three quarters of people were foreigners not speaking French but yet everthing was in French with little or no English explanation at all. It really was annoying. We had the right to understand just like the remaing French speaking minority. Fast tract tickets were adventures by themselves. Either the ticket machines were  pardon, not working  and you could not get the ticket or ticket collecting slots were not working so you could not get in there on time. some rides were closed without notice at the main entry, including Indiana Jones (closed forever I suppose), Captain EO (some sort of renovation), Pocahontas Indian Village (no explanation), etc. I do not think this place deserves the entrance fee and the next time we will prefer the original Disneyland.",0
"The park is crowded, the lines are a nightmare as is the parking, they never have discounted one day tickets that you can pick up cheap and absolutely everything is designed to separate you from the money in your wallet as quickly as possible. but hey its Disneyland they can get away with that because my kids had a blast all day long.",0
Never been to Disneyland (other than Disney California two days prior) and had a pretty good day! Fantastic shopping and the cool Halloween stuff happening at the tjme. Good as but the other park is more for adults with bigger rides so enjoyed that way more.Each to their own!,0
I took my family to a trip to Disneyland.as a person only hearing good things about Disneyland I was quite disappointed. Especially with the Fastpass system. When we went to use our fast fast for some of the rides they said they were already done for the day.so we ended up waiting 1 hour 30 minutes for the Indiana Jones ride when we're about to get on the cart the ride broke down.some of the staff are not very well informed about the history of the park. for almost paying $300 for the day it was not worth it,0
"Not really worth it. So crowded, we cannot move. The lines were full always. Probably they can improve their service.",0
"Every child needs to see Disneyland once in their life. A magical place for children. An expensive place for Mom and Dad!! A day pass is $80 for Adults. A four day pass for both parks was over $200. for an Adult. Still is great place for families. Just go prepared to have a fun, but expensive time.",0
"My husband and I love Disney. Every 5 years, we go to Orlando's Disney World for our Anniversary. We knew HK Disneyland couldn't hold a candle to Orlando's but we wanted to go for a cultural comparison. While this park has my favorite ride (Mystic Manor) and favorite roller coaster (Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars) out of all of the Disney rides I   ve been on, the rest of the park was lack luster. In the defense of the park, it was raining pretty much all day. (Rain has the potential to put a damper on just about anything.) The parade was understandably cancelled due to the weather. They did end up having the fireworks show at closing. The fireworks dwarfed the castle and it was a little humorous to me that the smoke from the fireworks completely hid the castle by the end. If you are in HK and you love Disney, definitely go for the Disney cultural experience. If you are not a Disney fan, this park will not make you become one.",0
"Having been to American Disneylands we found the Paris one quite underwhelming. Admittedly we did go on a wet January weekday but it was all a bit lacking. The day parades were quite small but overhyped and the places to eat were staffed by people that were very clearly unhappy with working there. The biggest issue however was with the number of rides that were closed and the amount of repairs and construction taking place, giving it a slight building site feeling.Unlike us, check the website in advance to see which rides are closed and whether it's value for money",0
"Been here 10 times over the past 15 years and seen it age... and not so gracefully either.Expensive food and gifts and good for the kids. Take your own packed lunch.If you like pin trading, you will also enjoy that. Don't be afraid to ask the staff with pins you like to trade. Quite often they do, but they are not obliged to do so if they have a particular pin they are very fond of.",0
"One would think that going to Disneyland on a Monday would mean less of a crowd than on a weekend. Well, it appears that I thought wrong in this case. Instead of the teens and 'tweens that dominate during the weekend, Disneyland on a perfect weather Monday was packed with adults playing hooky from work, and families with preschool aged children. This meant that Fantasyland, especially, was particularly chaotic. (Fantasyland was developed in a time before gigantic side by side twin strollers, and it showed!) There were a few places that weren't that crowded, such as Main Street, USA and the Monorail. Tips: If you really want to ride a particular ride, either try to get in on the Early Morning (one hour before the park officially opens) or get a FastPass as soon as the park officially opens. We didn't for Splash Mountain, and we didn't want to wait 90 minutes to ride, so we missed it. ",0
"Visited the park with my family on Wednesday. Tickets cost HK$619. IMO the park tickets are very expensive. The park is not very huge. Hence a 1 day ticket is sufficient unless you are staying in one of the resort hotels. Not many adult rides. Majority are kids friendly rides. For more adult rides, suggest to go Ocean Park instead. It   s also cheaper. Some of rides can queue for approx 30 45 mins.Food wise, There are a variety food offerings in the park from chinese to western meals. Set meal with a main course and soft drink will set you back approximately HK$100 150.We stayed there for the fireworks. It   s the last few shows before they shutdown the fireworks for a long period of renovation. The show was spectacular. Unfortunately they don   t offer it already. At the Main Street, there were even man made snow. Nice attempt to bring the Christmas mood.",0
"Pricing of Hong Kong Disneyland from 16 December 2016 increased from original HK$539 to HK$589 adult; then chirdren's tickets increased from HK$385 to HK$419 whereas elderly ticket remains unchanged at HK$100. Personally not recommended, it costs already HK$1,597 if you are a family of 3 people. (2 adults and one child) plus. the food inside Disneyland is not cheap.",0
Disneyland is Disneyland and one expects long lines and plenty of waiting. This was out first trip in November and we stayed from Nov. 4   11 which covered both Election Day and Veterans Day weekends. I would recommend opting for a slower time or only visiting during the week.,0
"Just returned from three days at euro disney,a party of five,two of us staying at the sante fe,the others at disneyland hotel because they wanted my grandson to have breakfast with the characters but you do pay a large premium to stay there.at the santa fe the room was fine even if we had to queue for an hour to checkin,the main down side of staying there is the bun fight for breakfast everyone rushing around with plates of rolls and ham madly making lunch to take with them to the park because everything is so expensive in there,the transfers between the hotel and park work well even coping with the rush after the fireworks, well worth watching even though we had to sit on the concrete for an hour because the place gets packed with thousands there on the evening we saw it,some of the rides seemed to have a perpetual queue best time is late evening not so many people about,now the gripes the place is so expensive for everything,the staff are to a large extent not friendly and do not seem to enjoy their work they all could do with a week in america to see how it should be done eruodisney is a very poor copy of the american expirience even if most of the children do enjoy it,and lastly we went from bristol with air france what a shambles they are they kept us waiting for over an hour for our baggage and there were only six checked cases on the flight,the baggage control seemed to have no idea where they were or where they had gone,the return flight showed it on time then we were told it had not yet left bristol so that was a hour and half late leaving,not good enough.thinking of going to disney do try and make it to the states no comparison.",0
"If not for Disneyland theme , I really not found it worth spending your full day on this. Quite expensive too and far from the city. I feel Ocean Park is a much better alternative to spend a day.",0
"My very first impression of Disney Paris is good, because after so many bad review and saying about poor doing of Disney Paris, well... the bright colored and majestic looking appearance does make me feel good.However, after few hours in the park, now I know why the park seem to be falling and distance away from their greater success story in US or Japan. I think is the content of their  magical  is not  magical enoughto me Disney is magical mainly due to it parade, I and my family had great fun with parades in Anaheim and Tokyo, is really magical and lively, the one over here... is just merely for the sake of Parade that they do the Parade, my daughter still enjoy it alot, but it fail to capture me and my wife heart, it just lack of that magical touch.2nd the food in the park, well... they really need to add some touch to that... it lack of variety and try to hard being  French  wayThe small world is close, and I am really disappointed with that, I try very hard not to mention the word small world to my daughter for that whole day.The bright side of this park is ... you do not need to wait very long for almost all the ride maximum 45 minutes, but usually 30 minutes will get you ride on, something you won't able to do in the other Disney park.However the Dream show at the park closing, does spark little magic out of me... it worth the wait for the park closure to catch the show, to me is even better than the parade itself.They got the right park, rides and everything but just need to put more magic portion in it to make it  MAGICAL ",0
"My 9 year old son and I just returned from a day where we had fun, but found the service and attention to detail very lacking compared with Orlando and Anaheim (I have come to find out that this has been a problem since day one of when it was EuroDisney). The usually impeccable and bend over backward service at the City Hall information desk was virtually nonexistent. Not only did the cast member not know the answer to our question (was there a place we could buy fruit), but seemed very disinterested in helping us. There also were many places where the physical upkeep of the park was less than what we have come to expect from Disney parks. Many restaurants and shops closed before the park's closing time (which was not even late in the evening    only 7:00). Lastly, there were many ride interruptions and times when rides were completely down    including Pirates of the Caribbean being (somewhat suspiciously) down for about the last hour the park was open.Again, we had a good time but you would need to go in with less than usual Disney park expectations.",0
"Came for a three day (1 day Halloween Party, 2 day park hopper) birthday celebration with friends. I probably should have visited during a non  holiday event  time, but was told,  oh, you will have SUCH FUN!!! . Maybe it was because I was dragged around that park for 10 hours that it lost its luster. I feel that I still haven't seen Disneyland the way that I want to see it. Get in early, seek out hidden Disney, instead of hitting the rides all day. I do not enjoy the tons of people, literally, dodging people, strollers, and electric scooters all day long. My perfect visit would be to go in, stroll the park, stop to listen to musicians and street performers, go door to door in mainstreet, things like that. Go back to the hotel from 3 until 7   nap, swim, soak your feet, have dinner, some wine, and return to the park in the evening for the parade and some fireworks. The rides are wonderful, but waiting for an hour, many times in the heat and behind screaming kids, or people on their phones, was not enjoyable to get a 2 minute ride. I had to leave my friends, who were buying trinkets   junk   any kind of junk   so I could go outside, sit on the sidewalk and finally   FINALLY take in a parade. So, nice!",0
"A good Family Fun day out to be had here. It is very small compared to the Anaheim Disney Land which I have been to several times. However this is still a good one to visit. The lines weren't that long for the rides attractions. But be prepared to pay a lot of money for food and drinks, as you always do at these types of attractionsOverall little kids and big kids will have fun",0
"Just came back on the 8th after staying a couple of nights at the sequoia lodge, to start with the overall amount of rides we went on was 2 altogether as many was too busy with wait times of around 35 minutes and with around 13 attractions closed in the Disney park , also we were waiting for meet and greet Mickey Mouse for about 20 minutes without hardly moving the whole time then to be told that Mickey was to be replaced by Donald ducks uncle which my children was a bit disappointed so we decided to leave our position in the queue, most shops are just selling toys,sweets, clothes and gifts which is expected but were quite expensive, I don't think we came across a ordinary shop which you could buy snacks and bottles of drinks from it was mainly eat in places which again        , the only place we relied on was our hotel little shop which just had cookies crisps sweets and bottles of drinks, and of course toys sweets clothes etc.. Didn't have enough time to watch the parade as it was at 5:45 sh and we had meal reserved at 6 before our visit so I cannot explain what that was like but brings me to also put in this review which I felt like we wasn't given enough information about the whole features of the park so we missed out on a few things because of this, whether that's the travel agents fault or the park I don't know but I suggest you find out everything it offers if you wish to go there, just like to add the Disney village steak house place was very nice to try out as you can have your lunch there with your hotel vouchers ( if you are full bored) the steak and peppercorn sauce was Devine and the restaurant was quite posh. if you did want to meet the characters in a shorter time you would need to be in the park for 8am sharp which I was very determined on the last day my kids were going to meet one for the amount of money we payed for the few days we stayed, so they did meet mini mouse and was very chuffed, Thanks for reading and I hope if you do go have a good time and please find out every little thing first as it can be a big help before splashing out on a visit , thanks again .",0
The Blue Bayou is expensive but not unreasonable for full service restaurant. The Monte Christo Sandwich is worth the trip! The setting is delightful sitting on the veranda of the plantation!We also had clam chowder and cheese potato soup at other counter places.While it seems like the food is costly in the park we noticed the prices were really in line with other restaurants in the area around the park.,0
"My 15 year old son and I visited Disneyland Hong Kong while on a holiday, and found it to be just so so. The upside is, it is easy to get to by mtr, and it is cheap to get in. The downside is that there are very few rides that are suitable for teenagers. The whole park is very small compared to other Disneyland parks, and it all seems to be aimed at 5 10 year olds. We were done with it in about five hours, and wished we had done Ocean Park instead.",0
The rides are constantly breaking down and it appears that this version of Disney feels that having Character actors is all that is needed lot of them. Weekend the parks were packed and full of wasps. Queues for rides were 2 hours or more One tip if you wnat to go on the steam train go to another station than main st   were the queue is 1 hour ,0
We decided to visit with our 3 yr old daughter whilst on holiday from the uk. Having never been to any other Disneyland locations I was very disappointed with it.There was a distinct lack of Disney characters around and there seemed to be more shops than attractions. Frankly peppa pig world at Paultons Park in the Uk was more enjoyable.I wouldn't visit again.,0
"Having visited Disneyland Paris several times in the past, I was looking forward to showing my hubby the magic of Disney. It started out well, i.e. we entered the park and the weather was good, but from then on, the magic could not outshine a park struggling to keep the magic alive. We had six day passes as part of a package deal including half board vouchers and vouchers for petit gourmande (afternoon snack). Our park passes stopped working on the first day, so upon every consequent visit, the entrance attendant had to manually punch the pass number and print a separate fast pass ticket for each of us (party of four). We quickly tired of this, and visited the park information office   which told us to take the problem up with our Disney hotel. Our Disney hotel could not assist us and told us to go to the park ticketing office. And so we circled around, until we finally managed to get new tickets on the second day. The rides were another joy. On every single day, a ride was cancelled, broke down, did not open at all or had a major crash. Technical error became our new worst friend. On two occasions, we were caught inside the actual rides and had to be evacuated. On many other occasions, we queued for up to an hour, to be told that the ride had to shut down.And finally, we had tremendous problems finding a decent meal. Our petit gourmande vouchers were impossible to use   on one occassion we hunted the Disney studios for close to an hour, to finally establish that the two restaurants which would indeed take our (Disney) vouchers were closed on that day (despite it being high season). This was extremely confusing, as almost all outlets would advertise Petit Gourmande, but not accept the Disney vouchers for Petit Gourmande.In addition, the restaurant food was extremely expensive, and we only had a few decent meals. In nearly all the restaurants, staff were stretched to the limit, and it was impossible to attract anyones attention, neither for ordering nor for paying.On the positive side, we did experience some nice rides, including Ratattouile, which we managed to get try on the very last evening of our stay (the ride suffered from repeat system failures). The daily parade was worth the wait, and the show at park closure absolutely fantastic. ",0
"We had to take a 3 year old grandson   which means of course you don't have a choice! Getting there   this is Hong Kong, mind you   was quite okay. However, the walk from the Disney Train Stop already is a hassle (lack of shade, directions). Once you get to the proper ticket counter (online orders only), you still have to cue up. Inside you get okay directions, but picking just your choice attractions is not easy, as you will have to pass by all those you didn't pick. Compare it to a supermarket or IKEA with their force you to buy layout. Now, once you do reach your pick, you still need to cue   not easy with little kids, and the quick channel, which you have to pay on top. You get hungry too, of course, and you're not allowed to bring stuff in! Apart from the high prices for any of the outlets, please don't expect quality or even appetizing food   you simply don't have a choice. What I just can't understand: they offer annual tickets and they even sell them! For me: once is more than enough. For my grandson: you get to see all those cartoon figures, rides, and stuff from the movies, which seems to be worth all the hassle. Congratulations to Disney for a truly rip off concept that even works!",0
We enjoyed our time at the park and left feeling like we had experienced a good day out but it was pretty pricey for what you got and even though we went outside school holidays and mid week the queues were bad and it really limited how much you could achieve in a day.To pay US$125 and spend half your day in queues is not particularly good value in my book.This place is just too overcrowded really to rate as great experience for me unfortunately.,0
"My husband and I travelled to Euro Disney (as they called it then back in 2006'.Compared to back in 2006 it seems to have gone a little downhill sadly ... Or maybe we were spoilt with a trip to Florida in 2007 who knows.We decided to travel to Disneyland Paris as it was closest, easiest and cheapest for our two children (2 years and 6 years). We stayed at the Kyriad hotel which suited nicely as it wasn't too far away and offered free shuttles to and from Disney each day.Upon arriving at Disneyland (which was a complete surprise for our children) it was sadly pouring with rain. Being English we are used to the odd downpour but we did fancy a Poncho and so we queued for almost 30 minutes at a small booth for a poncho for us and the kids . We found the ques appalling! People were shoving and shouting and quite frankly my husband looked totally bewildered by the idea of having to push and shove for a bit of plastic and he is too polite to push and be rude, thus it took us a long time to buy said poncho and the staff seemed far from happy with the situation. Luckily the weather improved throughout the day and so we were able to get dry again later. My son was happy to be at Disney , he was surprised but I don't think it was what he thought it would be ...  Firstly , he couldn't understand why on earth a queue would be almost an hour long for a ride which only lasts up to two minutes. I agreed and we soon figured out the fast pass route followed by the baby switch facility which is simply fab ! We managed about four rides on our first day as it was so busy but we got into the swing of things further along in the week.By day two we were starting to beats he queues with fast pass and baby switch and we had figured out to shop at a local supermarket to beat the prices. Top tip for anyone, especially families with kids is to make picnics as the prices in Disney as extortionate !!! We ate each day at one of the picnic locations near to a park. The kids loved the park (pochahontas themed park). However, we continued to be bombarded by wasps and unfortunately on my second day I was stung twice by a wasp , this sent my son into a panic every time a wasp so much as flew by... And they are everywhere in Disney it's a serious problem which seriously needs addressing.Things have really changed in terms of money, you can see this as whilst we greatly enjoyed watching the late night fireworks and light show ,it wasn't what it was when we first saw it many years ago. The fireworks are only very few in comparison to what we have seen in the past and they now rely up water and lights to create a show which I suppose was better for my son as he hates loud bangs. Personally though , the more fireworks the better for me. Saying that ,my daughter hated being in the dark so sadly we spent our time trying to watch said show whilst consoling our two year old and holding out six year olds ears incase of a sudden bang (which there aren't any for any parents with children who suffer with noise issues). Another big difference is the parades, when we first went parades were twice a day followed by the huge parade at night time prior to the fireworks... Now there is one parade a day and in between this they do a mini parade which includes a horse and cart with the frozen princesses in which lasts about ten minutes.... My daughter loved this as she developed a deep love for Anna whilst there.Frozen was certainly the theme of Disney obviously as its a hit film and the kids all love it (including me and I'm 32!). We had the pleasure of watching the frozen singalong which is well worth queuing for, it is magical as I took the time to record it on my iPhone, my daughter now spends at least twenty minutes each day since watching it ... Over and over ... And over and over .... She still waves to Anna even now from our kitchen table whilst having her snack.The shops!!! I love shops but my god there are loads and they all sell pretty much the same, it never used to be like that. Once upon a time each shop seemed to sell different merchandise which meant that you were more inclined to go into each one ... Now it is literally the same in every shop apart from the Christmas shop which was divine. We ended up spending an absolute fortune on merchandise as we are huge Disney fans. Upon returning home I sadly found that much of it was available on the disneystore for less than the park price :( At least our stuff is labelled with  Disney parks   but still, it doesn't seem fair that it's more expensive there than online ... So my tip would be to purchase your Anna, Elsa, Olaf or whatever else and take them with you to save tears from either your child or your wallet.My favourite shop is still the main one (emporium) but try to go early in the afternoon to avoid the hustle and bustle. The rides were fab but we're disappointed to find its a small world was shut until December. The kids enjoyed the rides and those that they couldn't ride were still accessible to my husband and I thanks to the baby switch facility. My only issue with the rides involves Thunder Mountain which seemed to break down at least twice a day (this happened all week ). My son and I had the pleasure of being the first back onto the ride following a closure and whilst he enjoyed it , I was slightly worried we would be one of the poor people climbing off on the ramp if it got stuck again (luckily it didn't). This needs fixing Disney if you're reading !!!I love Disney and I love the whole experience of visiting their parks but something was missing this time ... The magic ? I'm not sure .... It was sooo overcrowded and busy, I found that every time I needed the loo I was faced with a ten  twenty minute queue in the ladies whereas my husband went straight in and out. Perhaps more toilets for women with kids are required ?? Queues for food and toilets were awkward as who wants to wait for essentials with young kids ?!I think all the advertising of  now you can say yes   is because it can be achieved for cheaper these days with deals I guess and so now the park is packed to the rafters... This takes the magic away as it becomes crowded and uncomfy.We visited for five days using a five for four ticket from attraction tix (great value for tickets if your interested). We did have fun and the kids have memories to last a life time as we made it magical in our own way. I just hope Disney reads this and realise they need to reinstall some of their magic into their park. ",0
"Great time, Expectations were higher than imagined   learnt via tv ect. The bbq ranch is great to eat at. Some areas are oldish and faded, need upkeep   Toontown.",0
Cars Land and the Light show were the best two attractions.  Could do both parks in one day when you have no children.,0
"While we left with huge smiles on our faces, but I can't imagine we ll be back soon. The cynicism turned our stomachs. Food and souvenir prices were beyond outrageous; Disney knowing full well that enough parents are simply going to cave in to their childrens' begging, since making them happy is why they agreed to subject themselves to endless queuing in the first place. F  k you, Disney Corp. Second complaint: some of the rides, I kid you not, last about two minutes. The Indiana Jones roller coaster is amazing, but over in a flash. Ditto the Orbitron. While occasionally the lines move quicker than the given estimates, seriously, how utterly infuriating. My friend actually queued with his two daughters for an hour, only to have the fire services close the ride moments before they were getting on. As to the staff: many friendly and helpful, many not quite so much. Also, would it kill them to post more direction signs? The maps provided can only help you orient so much when you can't see what's where through the throng of thousands of people. Otherwise, the parades and late evening sound and light shows were my favourite feature. Many things were done brilliantly. But the cloying sense of Disney wanting your last euro, in the most cynical way imaginable, put me and my friends with children off, big time.",0
"The following applies to both parks. Queues for everything. A lot of rides were closed for refurbishment or because of snow. If you are prepared to queue 45 minutes, the rides are good. Not really any sensible food in the parks. Just burgers etc with a 30 minute queue. Food in Disney Village much better. I recommend Rainforest Cafe and King L  dwig. Expensive but very good. No general shops at all. Nowhere at all to buy things like medicines or 'normal' clothes, such as gloves. It was very cold and our hands were frozen.",0
"We have been to Disney three times now and each time it is great watching the kids faces.It is a wonderful place which allows you to be 8 years old all over again! So what are the punches you need to roll with? It is well documented that things are expensive, but year on year the increase has really over shot the mark of reasonable and some rides I am sure have got less in terms of their duration. Our co visitors seem to have become less and less pleasant.I appreciate that we in the UK may possibly be a bit prickly and prim about queuing, and just general good manners, or the  correct  way of doing things; but the visitors over the years have become marauding wildebeest. The shoving, queue jumping and the disregarding of children other than their own, is appalling. It starts off as eye brow raising, but really wears thin after the second day. Just keep this mind, like I said roll with the punches and try to not be too affected and enjoy the fun! Top tip   make sure you see the Disney show at 11pm perhaps a little too late for our younger visitors....it really is fantastic, but be aware they close all toilets an hour before the show starts until it finishes....so if you have somehow managed to keep our younger visitors awake for this extravaganza.......",0
"We have 3 children of different ages, yet still children, If your child is 10 years old or over they pay as an adult which I found to be wholly unfair and a blatant money grabbing stunt. Because of this we spent one day in an over crowded, over priced Disney. Will not return. Over $4 for a bottle of water ... seriously? ",0
"My 11 year old son and I visited Disneyland Paris on Sunday, January 15. I purchased our tickets online from the Disneyland Paris website a few days prior. We got a really good deal in my opinion, I purchased the  Special MAGIC 1 Day   2 Parks Ticket  and paid   45 adult and   39 for my son. So   84 for 2 parks, they were even cheaper if you chose the  Special MINI Ticket  which you can use only on weekdays. We only had 4 days in Paris and chose to go to Disneyland last minute so it worked out really well. We took the RER A (red) to Marne la Vall  e     Chessy and it drops you off right in front of the main entrance, you can't miss it. It took us about 45 minutes from our hotel and we arrived just as the park was opening at 1000. It was great because we were able to take photos without crowds and selfie sticks in the way and we entered the park right away. We spent the majority of our time at Disneyland (1000 1700). After the parade we headed to Walt Disney Studios just next door. The lines weren't bad at Disneyland, we were able to get on all the rides we wanted to and the longest wait was 45 mins to ride  Big Thunder Mountain . If you have ever been to Disney World in Florida, USA then Disneyland Paris won't be that big of a deal for you. They pretty much have all the same rides and attractions and even have the  Tower of Terror  in Disney Studio park. So very similar but worth a visit if you have never been to any Disney park. It was a very cold day when we visited but my kid never complained. I on the other hand wished I had worn double socks, my poor toes. It began to snow during the Disneyland parade and continued to snow for the rest of the night. We stayed at Disneyland Studios until closing (2000) and we practically walked on all the rides we wanted to, no lines anywhere. Best part of the day was the at 1900 when we witnessed the  Season of the Force  Star Wars show, it was great! The snow made it even more magical. Don't miss the show, they use the Tower of Terror hotel as a projector screen, have great sound effects, strobe lights, special effects and of course the characters come out and give a good show. We stayed until closing and grabbed a bite to eat on the way out. Prices are pretty reasonable for food and souvenirs. You can take your own food in, we did so we only had to purchase dinner. Dress warm if you plan to visit in winter, most of the day will be spent outdoors. In my opinion, this is not a  must see  attraction when in Paris but than again I have been to Disney World in Florida.",0
"Magical 1st timer eurodisney   Disneyland Paris but some magic moment being shattered by rude queue jumper, I say something to them but they just pretend to be dumb or ignores you and some just answer back in some language that I don't understand   but I don't want to ruin my little kids magical moment cause of these inconsiderate people! They need queue policy a little bit more strict.",0
You have to walk almost 20 Kilometers to cover the park.. also the wait time at each ride is atleast 30 45 minutes and fun experience of only 2 3 minutes... really awefull in terms of fooding options,0
"Hong Kong Disneyland is smallest when comparing with those in other cities. Most spots and games are similar, but some are lacking. One can finish in walking and playing around in shorter time. If you have been to Disneyland in USA and Japan, there is no surprise, and it is not really worth a visit. But if you have not been to any Disneyland before, perhaps you may like to have a try.",0
"First time visiting Disneyland! It's A OK. Not much of a Disney movie fan, but the wife and I agree we would come back to see more of Disneyland. (We would never go to California Adventure again   it's a dump.) We were dismayed to witness that the  Happiest place on Earth is sometimes not very much... And insane, outrageously high prices will ensure that only the  1 Percenters  will continue to be able to afford Disney attractions.The Pros   If you are a Disney movie fan, this is the place to be! Kids and adults who know and love the Disney characters will see them on Main Street and will love the themed rides and such. Overall the park is manicured and clean to a level not seen anywhere else in the world. Simply amazing how clean it is and we noticed, valued and appreciated that! Disneyland could also be considered a botanical garden with rides and amusement tucked into it. Disney should publish books on all the plants they have at the park (if they don't already). Heck if you're into flowers, plants and flora   go just to admire all of that. This park is also ULTRA  ADA compliant and it was good to see it so accessible to children and adults who would otherwise not be able to attend.The Cons  Disneyland is ridiculously expensive. Unless you live down the street from the park and have a season pass, you are going to spend 1000s of dollars to go to Disneyland, so start saving. This is a massive vacation expense for a family of 4. Costs will range from $1,000   5,000 depending on travel expenses.Disney parking is 16 bucks a day and a mile away with a shuttle to the park... Get a hotel close to the park and just walk there. It's only a 10 minute walk.The first sign you see...THE VERY FIRST SIGN YOU SEE, walking into the park says  Disneyland contains chemicals that causes cancer.  This is due to a dumb law in California that permeates all establishments, but hilarious nonetheless...The State of California also contains a disgusting compound known as a  Pelosi . There should be warning signs for that too......There was an employee forcibly telling guests to GO AWAY while the Disneyland Theater  rehearsal  was taking place. Rude, Lame and not well thought out. It's free advertising for your show! Everyone is standing there because it's right next to restrooms and snacks.The Matterhorn was broke down half the morning....sorry, but while we know  things happen    for the excessively high admission price   your maintenance staff should be up all night quality testing and calibrating the rides so that they are flawless during the day... That's the business you're in... No excuses. The carousel was broken down too and closed for repairs...I didn't care but you ruined a thousand kid's lives (including my niece's) who wanted to ride it.. Space Mountain was booooring... It's all dark, you don't see anything.... It's just a roller coaster, in the dark. The park is enormous and you will never cover everything in one day. It will take at least 2 days to see all of Disneyland.The biggest complaint is how incredibly cheap, chintzy and lame Disney has become with their pricing structure and park passes.... So you get a  Day  pass, but guess what... It's not really  all day . Because at 6pm the rides close and all these staff member  Disney Goons  with handheld sparkly signs (but smiling)   start checking for guest's armbands... If you don't have an armband, you're herded off to the left where you are unceremoniously dumped out at the entrance... You're politely but firmly being told to  get the F Out  because Mickey's Trick or Treat event has started and you weren't invited....  I also wanted to mention that the Disney Goons also stand with their signs IN FRONT OF THE SOUVENIR SHOPS trying to prevent you from entering shops after 6pm also. Horribly tacky and very unfriendly (and also not very  sales  savvy...). While most Disney guests were being herded out the doors and we overheard angry comments from guests about their day park pass not really being  all day , my wife and I managed to slip into a store to buy a few souvenirs for family members.We found out later that a  Mickey Trick or Treat  pass is an ADDITIONAL $67.00! So to truly spend all day at the park you need to purchase your  Day  pass   (which isn't really ALL DAY), and then you need to purchase an extra event pass for a grand total of $167.00 not including food and drinks or souvenirs. Most families will spend over $200 per person, per day for a  full day  at Disney. Rumors also abound (among hotel staff and guests) that Disney has fireworks every night! That was hilarious as we witnessed family members who had left early, or been ejected from the park, walk out of their hotels and or stand near street corners at 9:30 waiting for the fireworks to begin only to realize that Disney does not actually have fireworks every night.Look for deals and specials to milk every ounce of value you can out of your trip!",0
"I was kind of disappointed in Disneyland Paris. The park is quite small and the rides did not seem up to what I consider Disney standards. The outward appearance is very cute, but inside seems old and outdated. We are used to really cute shows in the USA. We waited for a Villains Show which turned out to be just one song sung by all the villains; one song is not a show. The best thing was the Ratatouille ride on the Studio side.",0
"We visited the park for New Years Eve 2013 staying a total of 4 days. This was our fifth visit but certainly the worst. The whole point of going to Disneyland is for the magic of Disney and the whole Christmas celebrations seemed to detract from this rather than enhance this. The main Christmas themed evening display was nice to see but not as good as the one we saw on our last visit in October 2012. In addition to this the park was packed to the point where you were continuously battling your way through crowds, huge restaurant queues and massive ride queues. Nearly all the queues in the park for the large rides were way to long averaging 1.5 hours plus for most of our stay. It was also annoying to find queue jumping and people standing right up against the back of you in queues. Fast passes are a great idea but most of them joint the standard queue in a way that you felt like you were pushing in, there were no staff helping to filter you through, instead you simply had to push your way in. Not sure why the Disney Paris management thinks this is acceptable in Europe but not in the USA. The rides as ever were great fun and the themeing is second to none, but the park falls short of the Magic Kingdom in Florida and the original Disneyland park in LA. Thunder Mountain broke down on three of the four days we were in the park which was disappointing. On the last day we waited 45 minutes even with our Fast Passes due to it breaking down and reopening causing a huge backlog of people.Probably the most annoying thing about this visit (that I have never noticed before) was the vast amount of people smoking all over the park; in queues (those outside and those inside), in the toilets, parades, shows and the doorways to restaurants and shops. I have no issue with people smoking affecting their own health but if there are smoking areas people should stick to these areas. The Disney staff did not seem to challenge members of the public smoking despite no smoking signs on nearly all the queues.Will not be visiting the Paris Disneyland Park any time soon and will never visit during peak time as its not worth it as the park standards slip. If you have to go during peak time go to Florida Disney parks as they are better managed and more enjoyable.",0
"My 8 year old son and I were in one of the souvenir shops while visiting Disney on April 3rd this year, he wanted to spend his saved up 50 euros on a toy, to remember the visit. We joined the queue to the till , in front of us were only 2 Arabic style dressed women waiting for their purchases to be processed. Before they were finished another lady in the same outfit came to them, passed them a huge pile of goods and a five hundred euro bill (to pay for her so she doesn't have to join the queue) and walked off. Before this was sorted, which took about 10 min, another lady came over to the 2 in front of us and did the same. This time i made a comment, that we are in a queue here and they are being rude. Another 5 minutes later ANOTHER lady came over and brought a pile of stuff with a big note in her hands to pass to the women in from on us.. This time i complained louder. And when ANOTHER one came and did the same once again my complaints got really vocal. At this point in the queue behind us was a person on a wheel chair and a few more. As i was complaining loudly a young french employee walked over to me, asked if i spoke English and suggested that my son and i were to move and join another queue in this shop, as  this one might be taking a while ... This was after at least 20 25 minutes of waiting behind the 2 original people who were in front of us.I believe , if you are going to give preferential treatment to customers with fat wallets that walk around flashing 500 euro notes   at least do it properly, without insulting other customers in your shop. My 8 year old stood there with a 50 in his little hand for the best part of half an hour to be rudely walked over by rich customers, which was blatantly and openly supported by the Disney staff.. Disgusting, disturbing, money grabbing attitude.",0
Ever since I was a child I dreamt of going to disneyland California and going on the tea cup ride well all my expectations were diminished disneyland California is not what i thought at all not only was it terribly busy on a Friday but the rides are very outdated the only partially interesting ride being the pirates of the Caribbean at least i can now say I have been but for a honeymoon experience very average I think much better for young children ,0
"Very small by Disney standards and aimed at the real littlies. As you would expect, terribly overpriced food which was really ordinary (although the bakery food was pretty good) and only 2 rides which would appeal to real thrill seekers. But the parades were fun to watch, the place is beautifully clean (unlike Disneyland Paris) and a pleasant day if you've got little ones.",0
"This was our third time as a family to the park. We had a good time and got on many of the rides without queuing, very rare as we have queued for hours sometimes for certain rides.The park and the studios park is dated and really needs a good clean. We do enjoy going here but you have to realise that this is run mainly by the french and therefore the normal or expected 'Disney' customer service is missing. We went to Anaheim a couple of years ago and this was the first disney park to be opened, even after all that time the maintenance and the park look better than this one, and Disney Paris is only 15 years old!!!It is very expensive for what it is and meals accomodation is basic. Although, we did find a few buffet options this time in the park for around 22 euros per person. I would reccomend taking snacks and drinks into the park, when they search your bags at the entrance they do not mind that you take such items in. The shows are really good and the whole experience is a step out of reality.Most of the visitors there are very selfish and push jump the queues this can be very annoying. If you get stressed out by this and waiting in line with nothing to look at I would give this Disney a wide berth.Overall, go and expect a euro version of the disney. It cannot be compared to Orlando or any of the other disney this is in a league of its own. If anything just have fun looking at the miserable and unhappy staff compared to the 'All American Smile'!",0
"*Family of 6, 4   70. Hotel Sequoia, fine, and found ourself in a breakfast hall with characters. No Qs, Was this because we did Disney Express or upgrade.*My daughter would self cater if theres a next time. *Park Food low in choice and expensive.And not easy to find healthy snacks* BOOK evening meals before leaving. Spontaneity is part of magic but not possible to eat before 9.00.   seriously. Or long qs *2 days were quiet , Qs. with shortish time up to 20   30 mins . But 30 85 mins other days.*Pushchair for under 5s (stand on board for under 7s) is a must, Dont guarantee to hire one.*Parades   we didnt bother   difficult to see and took the advantage of shorter Qs. on ridesYes the children luvd it BUT kept heading for frontierland playground.(The pirate playground was closed). That's telling. They love to use their imagination and to climb.Closures Dumbo was closed, Buzz cafe closed.Other things closed at whim*Beforehand All the homework you can before and after you book. Don't take anything for granted. egWe bought magic hours tickets and never used them.As we stayed up late. And check on fast passes and their limitations. On the first mornimg 10  1.00 ( a quieter day). We managed 3 rides.Yes a great theme park BUT I'm old enought to remember Walt Disney and his love of magical stories. My feeling is he'd be disappointed in this shopping Mall moneyspinner. And the Qs for rides, and toilets, and some food, and entry (not if on Park) etc.The kids want to go again but 2 days in our home town visiting its little adventure parks , staying over 2 night in a hotel plus some special shopping , favourite restaurants swimming and a film.would cost less than third and could be just as much fun........ sorry. I think I lost the magic somewhere",0
I have been here before and it was just not the same. The crowds are much bigger and the wait is too long. There are no trees so there is no shelter from the hot sun! The staff are not as friendly as they used to be and they did not try to understand that the temperatures were high and they could easily have hurried the pace between rides if they managed it properly. Also they never filled up all the rides and a lot of rides had only two or three people where 4 or 5 could easily have gone. The only good thing was they had a fast tract where you could punch your ticket and were given a time to come back for that particular ride. Though the time given was 4 or 5 hours after it still meant that we did not have to wait under the hot sun.The parade only starts at 7:30 PM and the light show at 9 PM!!!We were there from 1000 AM and there was no way our children could stay awake that late.They should look at having these two much earlier.,0
"It's nice but not more than that. If ur kid is a Disney buff he will have a blast, if not u might find the place a bit disappointing. It's run down, much smaller and less attractive somehow than other Disney around the world, but if u have nothing to compare it too you'll enjoy it. Food is over priced, mainly Asian (Chinese Indian) so bring along sandwiches and drinks. Also, no alcoholic beverages (for the adults)... Also, don't come on weekends or holidays. ",0
"I brought my two daughters (12 & 8) for the third time (prior two in Disney World Orlando. After all these visits, I still feel the  Disney  experience is so so:  long lines: who wants to spend 45 90 min waiting for a 7 min ride?  a lot of things feel rushed and not personalized   FASTPASS was not working in a couple of stations  food and drinks are expensive. We had to eat standing up (not even a piece of grass to sit down and relax)  we really didn't feel as  guests . Neither my wife nor I plan to come back. Based on our experiences, I'm not sure that my daughters look forward to return either. Sorry to spoil the magic!",0
"I am not a big Disney fan to start with, so the fact that we ended up choosing one of their busiest days in February to  go, was not a help.",0
"Our family just came back from Disneyland HK where we stayed at Disney's Hollywood hotel for 3 nights. Travelling with 2 kids ages 5 and 3 and 2 pieces of luggage, we took a cab from the airport, which was the easiest way to get to the resort. We were however tempted to take the train because we wanted to see Mickey's resort line, but in the end didn't   luckily. With big luggage and 2 kids it would have been back breaking. The Hollywood hotel was nicely decorated and colourful. Although it was far less luxurious than the other Disneyland hotel, it was quite suitable for kids. There was plenty of choice at the buffet breakfast at the  Chef Mickey  restaurant. Dinner at the same restaurant wasn't as nice and relatively expensive at HKD1,000 for the 4 of us, so we preferred to eat in the restaurants in the Park where we found the food quite tasty. We particularly liked the Chinese food at Plaza Inn.I wish I could tell you that we had a good time in the Park but to be honest after all our months of planning we failed realise that Friday 19th of October was a Chinese national holiday, so the Park was packed (clever us!). We got on a few rides like Buzz Light Year, Winnie the Pooh and saw Philhar Magic but missed out on Autopia (queue 60mins), Golden MIckeys, and Festival of the Lion King simply because the queues were too long. At least I got to shake hands with Mickey which made me happy! Fastpass is a good idea but is not available for all the rides   basically you are reserving a place and have to come back at a pre determined time when you can enter via a shortened line up (there is still a queue though)After one and a half days at the Park, on our third day we went to the city to do some shopping. We took the bus to the Disney resort line (which is right in front of the entrance to the Park), connected to Sunny Bay station and got onto the Tung Chung line bound for Kowloon. The Disney resort line is quite unique with Mickey window panes and handle bars as well as memorabilia inside the compartment. (By the way the free Disney bus service runs from the Park to Disneyland Hotel to Hollywood Hotel and then back to the Park, so if you want to go from Hollywood Hotel to Disneyland Hotel you have to go to the Park first.) The trip in to town took about 50mins which is lengthy by HK standards. Unlike the Airport Express the Tung Chung line makes several stops along the way. We then came back just before dinner time and by then all of us were exhausted.On the way back to the airport we took the cab which cost us around HKD100 . They are cheaper than the limousines and there are plenty of them hiding around the corner of the hotel.",0
"I must admit I haven't been for a number of years and last time I was there the cast members were very rude. I'm glad to say that's changed now and they were engaging with both my 2 and 12 year olds. However the atmosphere at the park lacks that magic sparkle you get in Orlando which is a shame. SMOKING is a huge Disney no no with a few allocated areas (I smoke so I follow the rules) not so in France, I was disgusted that people smoked in the queues for the rides let alone as they wondered about and all left unchallenged!!CLEANLINESS of the toilet facilities left me wanting to sanitise everything I was wearing let alone my shoes as the floors were disgusting.Overall it was a good day and we had lovely weather but I will not rush back it just doesn't hold the Disney Magic.

"Since the late 1950  s I have been privileged to visit Disneyland Anaheim. On one exciting occasion, my brother and I met Mr. Walt Disney. He was kind, gracious and everything we expected. This was the grand opening of the submarine ride, complete with live mermaids. During the coming years we were lucky to return to the magic kingdom and a great time was had by all. I have waited for years to take my grandson to Disneyland, and we planned for over a year. Making all arrangements through Disney Travel we expected it to be the dream vacation. I must say our accommodations at the Marriott Suites were what we expected, our 4   day hopper passes and extras were included and everything was in order. So off we go for the adventure of a life time. We decided to start with the California Adventure our grandson  s choice, little known to us our first adventure was to wait in line for an hour just to enter the park, followed by another wait in line to get our lanyards and pass covers which we thought would be a good idea as we were going to need them for four days. Finally we reach the first ride of choice the cars race track. At the beginning of the ride the time was 45 minutes, two hours later I got a message from my husband that they were going to need sweaters as the sun was now setting and the temperature was dropping rapidly. After a 2 1 2 hour wait our grandson got on the ride and it was over in about 3 minutes... after the long, long wait everyone was hungry and we began our search for food, the choices were varied fast food or expensive meals at restaurants that were a good deal away from our location or a wait time of over an hour. Exhausted, we gave up and went to our hotel and had a great dinner at Red Robin. We returned to the Park and managed to see a few more things but cannot justify the cost per adventure to the ticket price it was about $30.00 per attraction per person. My recommendation to Disneyland Parks, is to limit the visitors to the park. It was like being in a sardine can that was over filled! I love Disneyland but before I go again, there will be limits to the number of people they allow in.... If you are going to the park, bring $$$ money, go early at opening time. Have back backs with sweaters, sun screen, and a piece of fruit. The snacks are scandalously priced with a 25 cent bag of plain potato chips at $5.00 as an example. Make a plan and stick to it if possible or have a close alternative, get fast passes early, before noon if possible. Be prepared to wait in lines everywhere... Drink water, and located bathrooms early. In the future I think I will go for Knott  s Berry Farm and the beach.",0
"We've experienced some issues in three of atractions, I think that based on the ticket price, those issues shouf no happen that much, but we can always have fun in a Disney park.",0
"Everything is well designed and kept clean and staff are kind and helpfull. The opening hours should be longer in the evening. Closing at 20:00 is way to early (march 2012). The queues are long, so be prepared for like 60 minutes in a queue and then just 1 2 minutes of fun afterwards.",0
"We have just got back from our second visit to DLP. I love Disney and so do our girls, so I can't help be impressed with the parades, fireworks and Disneyness of it all. However, Orlando it is not. The staff are hit and miss. We experienced some great customer service and some staff who frankly did not want to be there or care.The place is a bit grubby and some of the outdoor parts needed a good weeding   the fairy tale boats for one.We booked the Half board plus package and we're not given an option to buy a meal package for our 2 year old as she was 'free'. However, when we got to Cafe Mickey on our first evening, we were told the only food available to her was baby fruit pur  e??? Luckily our 4 year old doesn't eat much and they were able to share her meal. In Walts we were told there was no food for her and we would have to order a kids meal from the menu at   15 ish, again they shared. I think if you eat in the buffets this is not such an issue as you can just get them something on your plate, but it doesn't seem it's been thought through for the table service restaurants.The food is ok, but overpriced. The table service meals are expensive, (you save about 20% by pre booking a meal package). Main meals in Blue Lagoon are    25 35, they're nice, but not that nice. A burger type meal in Disney studios is about    14. Bottle of water    3. Advise is to take your own drinks and snacks and load up from the breakfast buffet in the morning. They have 'no picnic' signs up, but as long as you don't get your picnic blanket out, they don't seem to mind you walking around with your own snacks. Pizza Planet is quite cool. It's expensive (no surprise there)    19 per adult. The lady was really nice and didn't charge us for our 4 year old which was really kind. It's basically a pizza buffet but there's a play area for the kids so you might be able to eat a meal in peace while they play, worth    38 in my book! Also, if it's raining it's a good escape. Oh, and book your restaurants before you go. There's a number on the website, they are really helpful and speak perfect English. I spoke to lots of people this time who got stuck with 9pm dinners as this was all that was available.I was also getting annoyed with the lack of places to buy a (overpriced) coffee in the park. We were in around 8am, and by 10.30 I was ready for a coffee, but no where was open. They seemed to open up at about 11.30 12. This may be a seasonal thing, weird though.Magic hours are great, however they don't open all of the rides or zones within the park. Most of Fantasyland is open except 'it's a small world', fairy tale boats, and casey's train. Buzz light year is open and some days Orbitron was too. The rides bit seem to keep breaking down. In the 3 days we were there, it's a small world broke for a few hours, the runaway train was not working on the first day (May have been the rain), the parachute soldiers in Disney Studios was broken down. We waited 35 minutes by the entrance of Adventureland to be the first on the Pirate ride. We fought our way to the front of the queue at the ride ( you have to or you get trampled on by people who have no concept of queuing or waiting their turn), we were then told the ride was not ready, 'they're late' was the explanation by the uninterested staff member. We stood there for another 25 minutes until they finally opened it. The pirate ride is excellent by the way.I know what a previous poster means by not really seeing the characters. You must see the parades, the spring one that's on around midday at the moment is excellent, in fact I think it's better than the 'main' parade at 5.30. Get a spot in front of the castle or near the stage for the spring parade, it doesn't go all the way down Main Street I don't think. The 5.30 parade is also great. Get a spot about 15 minutes before, and then don't move a muscle! You'll see all the characters here. Also eat in cafe Mickey, it's expensive, the food is ok, and the service hit and miss but you see the characters. They spend a good amount of time at your table, pose for photos and sign books, it's worth it. We did 'meet the princesses' this time. Wasn't impressed. You queue first thing to get your time slot, go back at your allocated time and queue again...felt like ages with restless toddler. You see one princess and you don't know which one until you get in the room. I can imagine it might be quite disappointing for a child really wanting to meet a certain princess. I think the only way to meet the princesses properly is eat at the Auberge (which I haven't done so can't comment). Meet Mickey is also good, get in the queue early, it opens at 10.30. Mickey has always been in cafe Mickey (eaten there 4 times) so you can also see him there. Also, characters make appearance in the hotels throughout the day. This is normally quieter and easier, check in your hotel for times.It seems to be acceptable to smoke wherever you feel like in the park. Guess it depends on your views on smoking on how you feel about that. I don't really mind but was not too impressed with the man blowing smoke over my sleeping children in an outdoor cafe seating area.The place is one giant shop, everywhere you look there's something to buy. All the shops stock pretty much the same stuff inside. I found the toys quite reasonable surprisingly. We bought our daughter a Jesse doll, it was    25, saw them in Tescos at the weekend for   35, they weren't identical, but pretty much the same. Princess dresses are    60 though!! Ouch. Take yours with you (well not yours, your kids') all the kids seem to dress up. Don't get caught out with no waterproofs, ponchos are    9 each. Also, the buggys you can hire don't come with a raincover.We stayed at the Sequioa Lodge this time (New York last time). The hotel was ok, for the money better value than the New York as it's only a 2 minute longer walk and the pool is much better. The decor is shabby, but I believe that is true of all the Disney Hotels, basically don't expect the Savoy and you won't be too disappointed. They changed the towels and made beds each day.My advice with young kids would be to get in the park early (8am) make the most of your magic hours and get in the queues for the things that don't open until 10. Head back to your room for a rest swim around 1. Go back to the park about 4, watch the parade, have dinner, do more rides in the evening.If you're able to go midweek it's much quieter than weekends. It gets more busy as the week goes on. Check French school holidays though.Overall, it's got its faults. I've been to Orlando, and this really does not compare I'm afraid. However, it's still good. Seeing the castle when you walk through the gates is magical, seeing the kids faces light up when they see their favourites is amazing. A few of the rides are really special and the parades would make even the hardest hearts smile. Enjoy",0
Disappointed with size compared to florida counterpart,0
I am hearing about Disneyland from many years. It was great ambition to see the Disneyland. As we spend for to see the Disneyland not meet our expectation. The security staff was very rude and not allowed me to enter the park with wearing my printed T shirt. and they did not pay back my ticket price.,0
"Our first time at Disneyland Paris, saved up for ages, wanted it to be a holiday of a life time for the kids, yes we achieved that, brilliant hotel, fireworks, parades and such a good atmosphere but disappointed as the whole of thunder mountain area was closed together with many other areas of the park. This forced all the visitors to crowed around what was open so even with vip passes the cues were bad. I would have thought being start of season sch holls etc Disney would have planned refurb works better, bad planning as it dulled the magic",0
"If you move fast, you can get thru the park in a day knowing that you won   t see everything. It   s certainly not packed like LA Disneyland or Disney World. Most of the rides in Small World are the same sans Peter Pan. Their rides in some of the areas are different. Food is really bad. Jr Yelper said we should eat at the best restaurant in the part, The Explorer Club with a variety of ethnic selections to order. But at nearly $20 a plate with meager portions, it was the worse Disney park meals I   ve ever had. The Jungle Ride was closed the weekday we went. They had 2 different Disney ice cream pops sold at the carts. One is blueberry and the Minnie is Strawberry for $5 USD. They were OK. The evening light show was basically flashing lights of Mickey and friends on the buildings. The electric parade was really good. We watched part of the Moana show. We were so bored and the singing was mediocre so we left. This is the 4th of the Disney parks we   ve been to and easily ranks at the bottom. ",0
"Being avid fans of Disneyworld, etc in Florida (and yes, i know we're not reviewing those parks), we were mortified with the staff and their lack of emotion, smiles, pleasantries, whatever you want to call it. At the end of the day, these are still disney parks and i would like to think that the 'magic' happens here too! Sadly, for us, it certainly did not. The staff, apart from the odd 1 or 2, were dreadfully rude. They looked at us as if we had 2 heads when we tried to purchase order anything (and we speak English)!! It also seemed to be 'the norm' to stand in a queue, as you do, for at least 30 minutes, to go on a ride, only to have families of French people being let in  sneaking in towards the front of the queue and pushing or should i say FORCING their way in so they didn't have to wait. We noticed a lot of different people 'kicking off' because of this and getting very agitated. This kind of thing should all be monitored by park staff so that tempers do not rise. WE made our stay lovely, the park staff certainly did not, and at least we can say we've experienced it, even though we NEVER will again.The rides were ok, but again, due to lack of emotion by the staff, it all seemed to lack that 1 special thing ................ customer service. The other minor irritation i have, we are smokers and at the very start, looked on the park maps for designated areas, however, no one else did!! People strolling around smoking, sitting having a coffee and smoking, WHERE THEY WANTED TO, so, we pulled up a seat, had a coffee etc, lit a cigarette and were told by yet another miserable human being (staff) that we had to move on!!! We apologised profusely and moved and then, people sat in the exact same seats, at the exact same table, and did exactly what we were told not to do, and the member of staff stood and watched them ............. and let them carry on!!!1 thing to say Disneyland Paris. ............... train your bl@@dy staff!! Courtesy goes a long way, and good customer service brings people back. END.",0
"The whole family likes Disneyland and this is a regular visit for us but somehow this time it did not feel quite the same, obscenely expensive (we knew that before going but this time it did not represent value for money), very busy (well it was August) and they have changed the Fast Pass system ( you really have to get the Premium Pass or you have to queue for too long).We stayed in the New York Hotel which looks ugly from the outside and dated on the inside and the whole park has this feeling of being run down and un cared for. I was genuinely horrified to see vegetation growing out of the exhibits on the Studio tour and it gave me a sense of no one really caring about the park and being more worried about the profit margin rather than the user experience. Rides kept breaking down, staff were friendly enough on the park but aggressive and thoughtless in the hotel. If you have young kids then great, If they are over 10 then I cannot recommend it.",0
"Very mixed feelings about our recent visit to Disneyland Hong Kong. Firstly we stayed at the Hollywood Hotel which wasn't anything extraordinary! I think I had very high expectations for our stay there   after all its Disneyland!Not sure if it was because of the crazy Christmas time of year that we went, but the lines were way tooo long, over 60 minute waits which 5 children under 6 are not going to cope with :( I must say however that 2 day passes were very affordable, and even merchandise was quite cheap considering. I was mostly disappointed with the fact that we travelled all this way and didn't get one photo with any of the characters. The wait lines were full of older people (40  !!!) Seriously, where is the fun for the kids if every line is full of adults! The kids were very sad by this :( The only thing that was magical was the beautiful evening show of lights and fireworks and the  snow  that fell in USA Street. Apart from that Disneyland really wasn't that great. I hope when I visit another Disneyland in the future I have a better, happier, magical Disney experience",0
"I have been to other Disneyland but this was the first one where a large number of staff do not smile or greet you enthusiastically. The foreign staff, however, are always in character and smiling and friendly so this may just be a Hong Kong culture. The park is not as good as others and the parade is small (around 8 floats) and the firework display at night is underwhelming. The restaurants are really good with a lot friendlier staff so this was really the highlight of the visit",0
The studios haven   t changed in the last 12 years or so we have been coming here ...desperately needs a make over and not a lot in there...the few rides look tired and need a coat of paint and some imagination to restore the thrill..the park itself again hasn   t changed only in as much that it has lost its sparkle and again needs revamping to bring the magic back..the staff have changed in as much as they are now very rude ...as is the French who think nothing in barging into you and cutting you up ....the prices are absolutely a Mickey take ...excuse the punn....this is spouse to be a fantasyland for children but I   m afraid it   s loosing it   s appeal!,0
"Most of the attractions are the same as the ones in Magic Kingdom at Walt Disney World, with the exception of Toy Story Land.They have changed some of the great attractions im Tomorrowland which I feel is a big mistake. Autopia (also known as Tomorrowland Speedway) has been shut completely and I remember there was a roller coaster ride which is also gone. However, they've replaced it with Buzz Lightyear Space Mission, which is fun   its a 1v1 laser shooting game where to hit targets to gain points. I remember I was so good at it I scored over a million points (max level) HAHA.Space Mountain ride is a must go!!! It's the same as the one in Disney World!!! Loads of fast corners and humps!!!The rest is pretty much the same so nothing much to talk about.The only thing good is with the opening of Shanghai Disneyland, you will hardly see any Mainland Chinese tourists in Hk Disneyland. So no more long queues and queue cutting.They do have the fast pass system but it's only for like 3 attractions (not the rides) so don't even use it   it's pointless.",0
"I do believe that Disneyland lives up to the claim of being the happiest place on earth, but I think I could be a bit better. When your in the entry queue to the park, the multiple lines can be quite long. Sometimes placing you in the hot sun for awhile. One thing I have noticed that causes the slow up is people that are entering for the first time and need to have vouchers, new tickets and the like validated and having to have their picture taken which can take some time to do. I think this is a bit unfair to those that have completed this process already. There are many unopened kiosks that could be used to do this process before you go through the turnstiles freeing up the time that the agents need to do this and making entry much smoother and quicker. If Disneyland reads this they could make this place even happier!",0
"If your a Disney Dork you will appreciate park and its twist on Disney. The park is very small, you could easily do the whole park in half a day so I wouldn't be comparing the park to California or Orlando... or even Paris. If you know your Disney Parks you know they love lining queuing you up for rides and shows. At this park while waiting to see Festival of The Lion King show there was nothing like this to keep people in line no staff and ropes as soon as the doors opened to theatre everyone was pushing and shoving (which is not in the Disney spirit).Festival of The Lion King was absolutely amazing and personally think its better then the one in Animal Kingdom in Orlando.The one thing that bugged about this park is there wasn't Walt Disney statue.Would definitely recommend it to people! ",0
"Went during the CNY period (20 Feb 2018). Over corwded with tourist (which is fine and understandable), alot of rude tourist who like to cut queue. Hope Disneyland management can pay attention to this and disallow such rude and uncivilize action.",0
"My friends and I visited Disney last week, may isn't a bad time of year to visit as the que times were not too long despite the park being full of people. However there was a lot of construction going on at different rides, most of these being ones suited for adults leaving us with no option but to lap the one roller coaster that was available. There was no notice of this construction anywhere prior to entering so were quite disappointed to find them closed   still a good day out but bad timing for us. A little more advertisement would've been good that these rides weren't going to be available to us as the small children's rides didn't really fill our adrenaline rush.",0
"I didn't read reviews of DLP before booking... I had this overwhelming thought that everyone would be super gushy about 'Disney Magic', Fantastic, amazing etc, etc....I wish I had now... I would have been more prepared. I HATED IT! Every minute I was there. Being British I truly am the stereotypical  wait your turn ,  don't push in .... but we were barged passed, shouted at, ignored by Spanish pushy mothers (and fathers!!) getting their precious little darlings first into anything! Lines to meet characters were a joke (as there was almost no such thing) and the variations of photo poses kid with character, mum with character, dad and mum with character, dad, mum, auntie, next door neighbour, next door neighbours cousin.... was totally laughable!! Again, when our turn, understanding it was 40 degree heat and everyone was a bit jaded, our photo was our precious little darling and character and then leaving!!! The only saving grace for the whole time there was Davy Crockett's ranch. It was a nice reprieve from the sun, being located in a shady forest, the downside was no one mentioned it was under full construction and was a bit of a building site! The pool was a blessing, and the food was ok (we were Half board   so saved from the 30 euro per head to eat in the Disney Park   would have been 150 euro a meal to eat there for four days.... that is the cost of another holiday!!)I thought DLP was a rip off. The queues were unbearable. There was no Disney 'magic' to anything at all.... my daughter was so distraught when waiting her turn for an autograph at the Studio 'circle' that Remy Rat signed every Spanish person's book, they were coming over my head, through my arm space and when I tried to assert myself he pushed my hand away!!!!! I wanted to scream! Then when they stopped the circle before she met Ariel I couldn't console her.... it was just heartbreaking. There seemed to be no order or method to what they were doing. People queuing to meet a character and then them saying actually we only have a couple of minutes and you will have to come back in an hour.... I felt like saying these people have paid thousands of pounds to do this, I think they deserve to meet the man in the dressing up kit, dont you!! I just wasn't impressed at all. It is a glorified Disney shop with a few rides thrown in.... and a lot of them not working boarded up.I sound really miserable... and I really am the least miserable person I know. But I wish I had booked a week in Paris and a day trip to Disney   don't I would have felt so hard done by!",0
"Since noon time 12 I reach to front door Disney land , until 6 pm , I only can visit 5 game stations , it is really big land and long queuing for many places , the food choice only fast food inside , expensive but not good taste , near by main door the chineses resteraunt must wait 1 hour to get seat , next time I will bring own water and sandwich carry to there , the most game I like is iron man , and mystery house among the games that I play ; they close at 9 , if you bring you kids go there better prepare some water and snacks also going to there a bit ealier morning . ",0
It was crowded have the time I went. Disliked the mean hispanics and I missed my seat on Heimlich's Chew Chew Train and a black woman cut in front of me during Phineas and Ferb's Rockin' Party.,0
"Having already arrived without any expectation, we were even more disappointed by the quality of their best rides. All of us were over 20 yo so we had targeted rides with height warnings such as Iron Man Experience, Grizzly Gulch, Speed Racer, and Hyperspace Mountain etc. Iron Man was the most disappointing of them all, as the '4DX' movie was too short, had an unimaginative storyline and was by far the worst disney ride. Hyperspace Mountain had been bought by Star Wars and its opening tune as we rode into pitch black was exciting and familiar. The ride was probably the best one and we went on it 3 times, but the lighting wasnt perhaps too bright and we could see some of the roller coaster's structure, which sort of ruined the  space illusion , unlike the one in Paris. Grizzly Gulch, an outdoor coaster, was also graced by our bums 3 times as well. To be fair, there was nothing wrong with the ride (it even had a surprise factor) however we were used to the likes of alton towers and our experienced and wise selves craved a higher thrill factor. Brownie points: great dim sum restaurant (presented by Maxim's) at number 7 on the map. The churros sold at stores dotted around the park were also spot on and brought back childhood memories.",0
"Visited Disney on a recent trip to HK (western couple, frequent travelers). It was really crowded and there was not a lot of shade. We did have fun on some of the familiar rides (space mountain, grizzly gulch) and enjoyed the overall experience. It was really nice to be able to take the metro right to the entrance. Most of our frustration came from being constantly hit in the face by the sun umbrellas of the other patrons and the fact that the concept of standing in line and waiting your turn seems to be foreign to the Chinese. Prepare yourself for that and you will enjoy. Would also have loved to see some of the characters roaming around for photos. ",0
I have always dreamed of going to a Disney theme park. What a let down.The park was run down and dirty. The staff didn't have smiles on their faces. I was planning on going to America next and one of the main reasons was to visit the Disney parks   now Im not so sure.Shame. Magical it wasn't. Parade was great. Lines were ridiculous. Had a fast pass but couldn't figure out how to use it and no one would help us.I made the most of it though because it was always such a dream to go. But it was not worth the money.,0
"We visited in October and were a little disappointed. We paid $92 each to find that we should have gone to the adventure park instead. We should have been informed when we arrived to purchase our tickets especially as we only had one day to spend there. My husband and I have been here years earlier so decided to bring our 15 y.o. son along this time. Basically the place has not changed all that much since I was first here in 1979. Once again there were rides closed for maintainance (which is annoying but necessary) but as we finished our ride on the Pirates of the Carribean, we were stuck in our boat with about 6 other boats behind us for about 15 minutes with no information telling us what was happening. Luckily we were only in 2 foot of water so no one panicked! The line to get into the Haunted House was over an hour long. I did love all the shops though. This park is really only suited for small children as there is not a lot of rollercoasters etc. Yes, it is worth seeing if you have never been there before but for return journeys you should buy a multi ticket for both parks especially if you have teenage kids.",0
"We had a good day at disneyland but felt the place needs a make over, most of the rides are the same from when I was there 30 years ago. The fast pass tickets where good if you managed to get hold of them. The park closed early for Halloween Party and we were left out in the cold. At the end of the day we were left tired just like Disneyland.",0
expected bigger and with more street shows. I could not found all the fantasy showed in their pictures,0
Despite being pretty much the replica of Orlando and I guess other US Disneys the experience doesn't generate the same excitement   it's good but the whole magic that you get from the customer service in the US is not part of the deal here. Good for rides and a weekend trip (from UK) if you can get a deal but the surly and slow service soon grinds you down. Save your money to go to the proper disney,0
"The real thing   Disney .. but pales in comparison to the LA or the Orlando Disneyworld. True that it is one of the few attractions which HK has to offer for children. Rides are okay and it can get crowded as is smaller when compared to other Disney parks. Easy access   and the kids will enjoy it, no matter what.",0
"Visited for 2 days with family of 10 aged 4 75. Stayed just outside the park and saved a fortune on Disney hotel prices and took in own food to save in the rip off prices inside. A lot of the rides were showing signs of ag   with some not working at all, staff did not take advantage if filling all available seats on each ride so the wait was longer than necessary. No control over the crowds for the parades. Before the parade started we were three rows from the front and the first two rows were sitting so we could all see. As soon as the parade arrive all the adults at the front stood so the children behind could not see! No announcements to ask the front rows to stay seated or staff to instruct. Waited for two rides for an hour before being told they were closed. You need to use your fast track as soon as possible   some rides with fast track closed this option by 2pm. We only had 15 min wait at the very start and finish of the day. The rest of the time it was an hour plus   if you are a thrill seaker you are better off at Alton towers  space mountain   arrow smith   terror hotel and the run away train are the bigger rides. Yes the younger children enjoyed the two days and the 75 year old great nanny went in all the rides. Would we go back   not in a hurry, it was 10 years since our last visit and will probably wait the same time or more till the next . ., just felt too commercial and not enought magic ",0
"Check the weather first before visiting, April is Rainy season in HongKong. A big No! We went to Disneyland last April 25, they cancelled the night parade minutes before the performance because of sprinkled rain. A lot were disappointed, we do understand but yeah! Toooooooooo baaaaaaad! ",0
"As expected, the park was overpriced and overcrowded during the first week of April 2017. Long queues for everything mean you only get to enjoy a handful of rides   not helped when the ride is taken out of service due to malfunction half an hour after joining a queue. (Note to Disney; a fast pass to some other ride would be a nice gesture on occasions like this). The good state of housekeeping was appreciated, with no signs of litter or neglect. Food, toilets, and security were fine   apart from the officious jobsworth who made my family pass our bags for a second time through an airport style scanner before being allowed to leave the park and walk to the car parks. Whoever blows up their own car and children after leaving an attraction? This is the sort of trip you'd want to make just once in a lifetime.",0
"4 main rides were under maintenance including the Ratatouille ride. Longest waiting time for a ride was around 30 minutes. The Star Tours were somewhat disappointing but the parades made up for it. Great diversity of characters in the parade although we only saw one character, Jack O'Lantern doing a meet and greet in the park. It was a strange day, visitors seem to be quite rude and impolite.",0
"Just come back from  Euro disney  with a mixture of emotions, the park itself is fantastic, however the queues and prices put a dampener on the visit. I went expecting the park to be busy as it was half term, but queues up to 90 minutes for a 1 minute ride were excessive, it appeared to me that they admitted far too many people into the park, which resulted in the large queues.Additionally due to the number of people using the  fast pass tickets  you were only physically able to use one per day, and some days we had to wait 5 hours to use this ticket.Food and drink prices were also excessive, 19 Euros for a basic burger and chips, 5 Euros for a very small carton of pop corn.To summarise my children loved the park itself and the shows, however queueing was an issue.",0
"dont bother taking the early morning entry bonus only one ride was open at 8am   10am although the outdoor funfair style rides were available, like the Carousel and not all the 'lands' are open at that time. You can only get one fastpass per ticket at any one time so when the time expires on that one it will allow you to go and get another one for a different ride.",0
Travelled 21st March for 3 nights.Weather was cold but thankfully dry! The Thursday and Friday were not too bad but the queues were rediculous on Saturday and Sunday with some being as long as 110 minutes! The extra magic hours for disney hotel guests were not as good as you would think as there were only a small selection of rides open so the queues build up very quickly for these.Dreams show and parades are must.,0
"I have visited Disneyland Paris about 10 years ago. Having an 11 year old that hadn't been I decided to visit again. What a stark difference. The park is no longer fun. It is all about extracting           from your pocket. Staff are rude and unhelpful (security guards come to mind) rides average 50 minute queues   so work it out, no more than 7 rides in a day with time for lunch. Despite having a fastpass for Big Thunder Mountain, the ride broke down 20 minutes before our pass was valid, and we were told that the pass was now invalid. Lunch was derisory. 2 of us had Chicken Fajitas. The guacamole was in a sachet and was handed to us frozen. Yes, Guacamole Ice Cream described it better. We returned to our hotel, disappointed and much money spent. Hotel staff told us that Parc Asterix is much much better and to give Disney a miss. I will listen to them next time.",0
This park has changed very little in the last 15 years. The rides are now dated and uninspiring plus the service and hospitality definitely has not improved either.The tram tours is exactly the same as 15 years ago and props used are for films no one has heard of. The rebranded Star Tours and Hyperspace Mountain are also dated. The Rock n Rollercoaster is bland compared to ones in Florida.The hotels are expensive and the staff inefficient especially for check in.,0
"As a party of 5, we have just returned from Disneyland Paris. There are still plenty of positives (we still had a lovely time), although DLRP must realise that there are some issues that need urgent adressing. Austerity or not, if they are going to charge premium rate prices, they have to make sure they offer a first class service.RIDESThoroughly love  It's a Small World  and  Pirates of the Caribbean , especially on hot days! Buzz Lightyear Laser Blast fun, but aiming seemed to be hit or miss depending on which spaceship you had.We all enjoyed most of the roller coaster rides, but I still harp back to the days of the original space mountain. I just remember it being the most incredible ride with the music accompanying it so took my young sister on it... Head banging is how I best describe it now   I don't buy the idea that a trip to space is meant to be so rough... surely a ride should be enjoyable.Thunder Mountain was our favourite, but the game we played for our trip was guessing whether it would be open or closed...  Probleme Technique  occurring at least twice daily surely should be sending alarm bells ringing if I was an DLRP engineer.Feeling is that they need at least two more rides akin to Thunder Mountain (minus all the technical problems), as they have a real issue with...QUEUES!!It may have been hot and during the school summer holiday, but the place was heaving. Seeing young children in distress does not make for pleasant viewing which begged the question of whether the park had a maximum capacity. We were incredibly fortunate to make the most of the fastpass system, but seeing main queue lines for 90minutes  is simply unacceptable.Now comes a real annoyance   queue jumping I'm sad to say by the French is shocking. I mean, all shapes and sizes, young and old, will try to simply skip queues. What's worse is that it seems to be universally accepted by staff. They have to start using a zero tolerance approach, otherwise things could have easily boiled over in the hot weather conditions.We did our token bit to stop it   at  Pirates of the Caribbean  I had a French teenager standing so close behind that my initial thought was he has trying to steal something from backpack so took it off and carried it. We moved as a family in a line so he couldn't get past during our queue time. He then made the unfortunate mistake of calling us  les rosbifs , which for those unsure is derogatory slang that the French use to call the British. With a couple of us being able to speak French, it took great pleasure to tell him exactly what we thought of his attitude... He shut up after that!SMOKING!!Why not ban it from the Park? The designated smoking areas were not being used, so smokers just had free reign everywhere apart from indoors. Again, nearly all staff didn't take action to apprehend smokers apart from one outside the Peter Pan queue (who got a massive round of applause)TOILETSErm... lets just say that they should come with a health warning   absolutely foul. No further explanation required.STAFFThey have come in for plenty of stick in the past for not being  Disney like , but from our experience they were mostly very helpful and positive. Just need to take firmer action against smokers and queue jumpers.SHOPSMostly overpriced nonsense, but I bought a t shirt for my young sister for 10 Euros which was not too bad. Seemed to be so many outlets in the Park when they could do with some more rides.BEST ADVICE1. Have a clear plan for your day   plenty of walking involved!2. Use the fastpass system for Thunder Mountain Buzz Peter Pan, and go on other rides in between3. Make the effort to speak French   you will notice a difference in the level of helpfulness (although I appreciate that this shouldn't affect customer service for a holiday destination)In summary, I know we will go back, but I sorely hope that someone, somewhere at DLRP will take the action to improve the park so that it can at least come closer to their counterparts around the world.",0
Everything has gone up in price $2 for a piece of fruit and $3 for a bottle of water. Long lines and people everywhere. At the character meals they add gratuity in so watch for that and they will remove it and you can do your own.,0
"It pains me at how bummed I was by these parks. I'm a total Disney nerd and to see a Park in such disarray was just shocking. I've been to wdw & Disneyland in the states multiple times so maybe my expectations are high. We visited on the 2nd & 3rd. Our French is really, really limited but we tried to work with people. Most were okay but some were downright rude about it. I mean, our first experience with a cast member was ordering food and she rolled her eyes at us! Ma'am, have you heard about the 5 keys? Also, where in the world are all the cast members? You usually don't have to walk more than 10 feet to find one in the US parks, but here...good luck. We were waiting for the Disney dreams show in front of the castle. It was cold so not a lot of people were there, but some were milling around, staying put. 5 minutes after the show was to begin, we finally spotted  information  cast members. My husband went to ask them about the show and when he came back to tell me that the park was open 2 hours later than what was posted and that they said  maybe  the show will be put on then but they didn't know...I was shocked. You're information. If you don't know, who does?? And the disorganization, oh my goodness. I know all the security is a new thing for them and I'm understanding of that. I know the drill, there's a learning curve. But there is absolutely no reason why there should be a line out the door to check in to your hotel. No reason why there should be only one person at the X ray machine. No reason there should be 75 150 people waiting for a bus to get to the parks at any given time. Get your act together. It really really shows that they had no idea what to do when they got their butts saved from closing. But there were highlights. I love that these parks are not princess centered. I love my princesses but it's taken over. I liked the merchandise found. So many of the under appreciated films get love and that makes me happy. We met Mickey & Moana and both were absolutely fantastic. Toad Hall was fun. The Christmas decor was lovely. Just enough & very beautiful. The parades were good, everyone seemed to enjoy themselves even though we were cold which is saying something. We had a lovely and accommodating waitress at bistrot chez remy & the cast members that snagged us a same day reservation were very helpful and kind. I was just so bummed by the level of disorganization and rudeness we came into contact with. I won't be in a hurry to return. ",0
"It isn't the happiest place on earth anymore. It's getting more and more crowded. Despite fastpass too long wait. Everyone is so stressed out there. All food, shopping is so expensive. Impossible to watch fireworks, parade. No doubt it's beautiful n magical . I wish they had a cap on number of people to keep it sane.",0
"Arrived at the park in the shuttle bus area, of which is now charging for parking for day. Used the shuttle bus to arrive at the entrance to the park. Security searching bags found a cam stick pro extension pole in my sons bag to which we were told we couldn't take it in the park. We were given the option to go back to the park where the car was parked or hand it in. We handed it in because the queues were massive, and we asked for a ticket to collect it once we had completed our day. No ticket was the response, you've lost it. There was no sign at the shuttle bus area warning anyone over tripods, selfie sticks etc. We were told it says so on line. Absolute disgrace, Disney has lost its way as it is supposed to make you smile all day during your visit.   60 worth of camera accessory confiscated. That's not a good start ! Secondly the park was packed to a situation where you queued up for everything far too long, and we had bought these crazy fast track passes at an extra cost. To cap it all, the Internet hot spots that are supposed to be dotted around the park are not clearly marked and you spend the day trying to find them. Just so poor from Disney and we've been twice before, so we expect better things from this organisation. The fireworks display was cancelled due to high winds. There wasn't any wind whatsoever on the day in question.Finally the fantasm show was excellent but the crowd control was hopeless, which meant you seen very little of the show itself. Disney, we are very disappointed in you. Our day was certainly not a memorable one ! ",0
"I've been to DLR in California, Tokyo Disneyland, and Hong Kong Disneyland, and I'm sorry but I have to rate this park the lowest among them all.First of all, THE SMOKING! I couldn't take three breaths without getting a whiff of cigarette smoke in my lungs. I must have killed quite a few lung cells during the 3 days we were there. I understand that smoking is pretty much normal in Paris, but this is Disneyland! Why isn't there a ban on smoking in a place where there are plenty of little kids around?Some of the staff don't seem to be enjoying their jobs all that much. In every other Disney Park we've been to, cast members all greet you with a smile. Not here though.The Disney Dreams fireworks and lights show was fantastic though.Overall, I can't say I want to go back to DLRP anytime soon.",0
"I have been to Disneyland 3 times. I probably won't go back until I have an 8 year old kid (currently childless, so...not for a long time). The park doesn't care about overcrowding and the ridiculous amount of strollers. They want your $100  for the day, and don't care about line wait times, or park capacity. 3 of the main attractions were closed, which was a bummer. It's just too pricey for two people to spend a day waiting in line for 4   5 rides. What's the point? Knotts Berry Farm and Universal Studios are 100x better, and have half the issues (and are more economical). ",0
We found it to be extremely busy. No control over smoking in the park despite it being forbidden except in designated areas. Not ideal when travelling with asthmatic children.Rides and some areas a bit worse for wear.Staff on one day could give different rules for rides than others. Very confusing.The park is good for kids but definitely needs improvement,0
"Why does Disneyland have such a strong following? My guess   powerful marketing machine. Hook the little boys and girls (esp. girls with all the princess industry) at a very young age with happy ending movies, and keep repeating  HAPPIEST PLACE ON EARTH!    because, you repeat anything a thousand times (even blatant lies), it becomes the TRUTH, right!?The crowds are peak times are simply murder. If you don't have the fastpass, you could stay in line for 2 hours or more for a simple ride. Definitely not my idea of  happy .",0
"May 30th was apparently Grad Night at Disneyland. This would have been helpful information to plan the late night part of our trek to ride rides. On our way from the parking garage to the main entrance our tram operator indicated that the park was open until midnight. Just after 11 pm we made our way over to Splash Mountain, as it had been broke earlier in the day and a pass to get on fast due to the earlier delays. We rounded Thunder Mtn and found a blockade. Only 'grads' with wristbands could go through. We explained what we knew and and how frustrated we were that this was never communicated. The employee sympathized with us, and said some parts of the park were closed....what we found out shortly thereafter was all of the park was then closed to 'grads' only. only main street (shops food) was open til midnight. What a bunch of garbage. Sorry, but if I had known that the park was closed at a 11 that would have been fine. But we were informed midnight....Since we live in Colorado we don't frequent Disneyland so it was just very frustrating and upsetting. Another issue was the break down of many of the big rides, Space Mtn, Splash Mtn and Indiana Jones. On a positive the food was great throughout the park! We had lunch at the Big Thunder Ranch   all you can eat ribs chicken and it was GREAT! The fireworks show over Sleeping Beauty's castle at 9:30 pm are a can't miss! They were awesome!Tip: Be extra mindful of any events that close all the rides!",0
"We are a family of 5 and we went to disneyland this year and it was alright, it was mostly for children. The best thing was the mountain rollercoaster and the 9pm fireworks. The weather was hot and there was too much people. The prices of the food were like 98 hongkong dollars, which was quite expensive, it was nasty and dry. I would not reccomend eating the food.",0
"My family and I had been planning to visit Hong Kong Disneyland for about six months before we actually went there. None of us have ever visited a Disneyland before. Our Main destination was actually the Philippines, but my wife always wanted to take our two boys to Disneyland, and Hong Kong was tantalisingly close to the Philippines. So we spent two days there before travelling on to Manila. Before we went, I read all the other reviews on this site, good and bad. We were there on December 26 & 27, 2012.My overall impression was Good (but not Fantastic).I loved the Parade. It was really well done, not too long and not too short. One of my boys got asked to participate, which was lovely.Space Mountain, frankly, scared the **** out of myself and my wife, and I admit it. The boys (aged 11 & 9) didn   t mind, in fact the younger one loved it. So I guess it   s Horses for Courses. I liked the Grizzly Gulch roller coaster, though. I   d do that again. I liked the fact that the waiting queueing area went through different    rooms    and were part of the experience. It added some interest to such a tedious thing as waiting in a queue. (It so happened that our queue was less than 5 mins for this particular ride.) I liked the Toy Soldiers Parachute Drop, though it was really too short. Quite a few of the rides were like this, really too short. Orbitron, the first ride we tried, was too short, and left me thinking    I hope that the other rides aren   t all this short   . Not a good introduction.Autopia was fun     not so much for myself as much as for my children. My enjoyment in this was in watching them (from the passenger seat) having fun    driving   . This made it really quite enjoyable. The ride earned bonus marks in my book for all the cars being RH drive. (As they   re in Hong Kong, they should be RH drive!)Buzz Lightyear   s Astro Blasters was fun, both for myself and the boys. My 11 year old creamed me at it.We all really enjoyed    It   s a Small World   , especially my wife.Grizzly Gulch looked nicely spooky at night. We liked this.There was a lot of attention to detail in a great many places, eg the Scrabble letters on the Toilet sign in Toy Story Land. This sort of thing went a long way in making it that bit more magical.And the highlight of all: the Fireworks. This for me was what I had REALLY been looking forward to seeing, and they did not disappoint.One thing that WAS disappointing was the lack of characters wandering around greeting us. Actually,    lack    is the wrong word     there were NONE WHATEVER. And twice we found characters posing for pictures with guests, and other people queuing up for them; and BOTH TIMES when we got to the back of the queue, we got told,    Queue Closed   ! Sorry, but this really made me cross. It was SO UNNECESSARY. All it would have taken was a decent number of characters wandering around, and this situation wouldn   t occur. It left a nasty taste in my mouth.Food was a little on the pricey side, but not unreasonably so. We found that feeding the four of us was a reasonable proposition.At the time we were there, there was this whole Christmas thing happening. We didn   t really like the artificial snow that fell at night in Main St USA. It got into our hair, eyes, and everywhere else and was much more of an annoyance than anything else. And another thing: not everyone has snow at Christmas. Where we live, Christmas is in the SUMMER, thanks! Where was the representation of that? Not everyone lives in the Northern Hemisphere mid latitudes.Overall impression: it was magical, but not magical enough. A little more effort on HKD   land   s part would have made all the difference. I   m glad we went, but we won   t be going out of our way to come back.",0
"if its your first time visiting a disney park, any disney will be an amazing experience for you. Me personally i have been to all disney parks in the world and find this the most disappointing. for the amount of visitors they receive in this park and the amount we pay there should be alot more attractions, shows, places to eat etc. its clean, its nice, its okay, its disney but for disney, they could do alot more with this park.",0
"Arrived around 12pm, had issues getting in because of my BOGOF ticket with Expedia   my fault for not printing off, but after this me and my friend ran off and got excited by the Disney castle thing. With us both being 21, we headed for the rides suited to older people: Space Mountain, Terror Tower and the Aerosmith one. Space Mountain had an estimated queue time of 90 minutes. Went by fine, two kids kept trying to push in   so with the help of other guests we managed to block them out    . The ride was exhilarating and fun   enjoyed it a lot. Also enjoyed Terror Tower lots   queue time of around 45 minutes. (Queue times based on the displays, didn't actually time it myself)Aerosmith ride didn't have an expected Q time, but it felt like AGES. LONG. The ride was okay, but there was no thrill, just a lot of head bumping. Indiana Jones was fun  went towards the end of the day   queue was around 15 mins. Saw 3 parades   all very entertaining. Had no idea when the characters were available to have photos taken with, but we managed to spot some by chance. So difficult to get photos with them, we managed one with Remy? from Rataouille   even that was hard!We had a park hopper and after space mountain, we headed to the studios because they closed at 7pm. We didn't take advantage of the fast pass, didn't realise it was free but it seemed that the ride we were queueing for had run out anyway.Lots of waiting for us   even though I've become so accustomed to queueing   I'd hate to think how young kids would cope. Probably would recommend spreading the visit over several days   or deciding what rides you want to go to beforehand.",0
"It would be fantastic, if only was not so overcrowded. You have to queue for everything: from a ride to having an ice cream, from a picture to sitting for lunch.Amazing attractions and kids truly enjoy it, but honestly these queues are terrible: unless you buy one of those expensive fast track tickets. It looks like a very proficient business model.",0
"It's a lot smaller, less to do and a lot more crowded. The hotels are massively overpriced. It's nice that it's by the sea.....that's about it!",0
"We had such a great time bouncing with rigger, visiting tarzans tree house and doing  the river ride with gina. It was my first visit in a disneyland and I  expected less than i got.",0
This is a great place to visit and fun was had by us all.We didn't queue more than 30 minutes for any ride and getting a fastpass was really easy. Some of the parc is being currently upgraded so few rides and attractions were closed. This gives us an opportunity to go back in a few years time. This is probably why i didnt give the parc 4 stars.Some of fast food wasnt great and our french fries were always luke warm. Would visit again.,0
I thought there would be more rides for adults. W had a really great day at universal studious the day before so were a little disappointed with disneyland. A few of the rides were closed down for maintenance which we didn't know about until we got into the park. Would have been good to see what rides they had before entering as we may have preferred disneyland adventure park rides? W went on a weekday but the lines were still crazy. The only ride that's really fun for adults we thought was space mountain. Some of the rides are a bit outdated. Good for little kids as there are heaps of kids rides but next time I would try out knots berry farm or something else instead.,0
"I travelled here for my Birthday after a much anticipated wait, 6 Disneyland visits, and 20  Walt Disney World visits. The park is not well situated considering it has not grown enough to be a destination in and of itself. We spent 3 nights in Paris and then finagled the RER to spend 3 nights in Marne la Vallee at the horrific Hotel Sante Fe, but that is for another review. Every morning you must go through long security lines and x ray machines to get to the parks and it is not surprising to see armed guards walking about the train station, not exactly the Disney Experience Walt had in mind. Once inside, the park itself is quite stunning. The castle is so unique and I like that the rides were not cookie cutter duplications of the US rides. The grounds were well kept despite several refurbishments in progess. One item of note, the Park does not forecast its operational updates very well on the website. When we booked (a little under two months out) only the Alice in Wonderland Labryinth was supposed to be closed during our trip, but by the time our trip time came, Phantom Manor and Indiana Jones were the actual closed attractions which was a HUGE let down. The Park certainly looks and feels like Disney until it comes time to interact with the Cast and other guests. There is hardly any customer service in the park, and apparently no manners or common decency. The guests have no concept of personal space and continually crowd and bump you in lines. One or twice I understand, but a grown up should not be continuously crowding you and blatantly attempting to jump the line. Rampant smoking in lines was also a problem. The cast members did absolutely nothing to address line jumpers or smoking. I also witnessed a Mother allow her children, boy and girl to urinate (openly) on a bush in the queue. Appalling!During our trip, the park closed at 6PM each night. Disney Village gets old after one night so there was a lot of boredom after the park closes, especially since the last place we wanted to be was in the hotel room.Overall, I am glad I went just to see it, but the rude guests and cast members sucked all of the  Disney Magic  out of the experience. The Cast Members in particular need a good re training in the Disney Way.",0
"We visited Disneyland Paris this year's Easter. It was as expected full which made it not really nice because we had to wait at least 1 hour at every attraction for a few seconds of fun. Another problem was that not only a lot of attractions were currently unavailable but also many of the available had technical problems which made them out of order for hours. Almost everything is in France although most of the visitors are from other countries! ! We also didn't like the fact that everything in shops had to do with Mickey Mouse and was unreasonable priced . The 1 day 2 parks ticket cosst 81    which is kind of expensive and parking is extra! However, we enjoyed our stay there, we had a lot of fun at the attractions and the Disney Dream show at night was awesome. We found it a good experience for once.",0
"When we lived in CA, I used to go at least 2 or 3 times a year.. I had not been in quite some time, and it has changed.My granddaughters had not been since they were 4 or 5, so we thought it would be great.We arrived early on the shuttle from the hotel which was nice. First stop was breakfast in Frontierland. Wad not crowded at all. Spent a couple of hours on all the rides in Frontierland and Pirates...Haunted Mansion...It was downhill after that. The crowds arrived. Went on a few more rides after navigating through the crowds....the lines were long, and the wait times tooo long..Therr is just too many people now, too many strollers, and no one seems to be smiling anymore. Grand kids wanted to leave at about 2:30... Am sorry to say my memories have been shot....the competitor done the road is better....",0
"Came feb half term. NEVER AGAIN. Like previous reviewers have stated, be prepared to queue! To get your bags searched(I took in a carrier bag of snacks and it was fine) to get into the main entrance, to get fast passes, to buy a drink and not forgetting, to get on the rides. I can laugh now, but at the time it is completely SOUL DESTROYING. You were looking at anything between 40 to 90 minutes wait times. Not fun when you have to explain it to a bored 6 year old why you are waiting every 5 mins, with the cold seeping into your bones, this would wear anyone's patience down. We queued for phantom manor for 40 mins and then nothing! The queue just stopped moving. We were stood there like lemons not knowing what was happening, no one came to tell us anything. In the end we had wasted enough time so left like everyone else and asked the lady at the gate, she was very smiley and said it was a technical fault and it would be up and running in 2 minutes. Too late! We had already lost our place in the queue. I wanted to punch her in the face. What rides we did get on we enjoyed, esp crush's coaster, and the ratatouille ride. We managed a few fast passes, when we could get them. Food looked overpriced and mass produced. Take lots of snacks with you you'll need them in the never ending queues. We left to eat in the village, much better but a pain to walk there and back again. I thought the French attendants were nice and polite, they could teach the staff at Alton towers a thing or 2, and the park from what I could see was clean. But they have to sort out the broken seats on rides and queue times, my intention on going to disney was to be happy, not to feel as much anger as I did! Overall I won't be coming again for a long time, it was such a dissapointing and stressful visit, and I didn't feel the magic I first felt when I visited 15 years ago.",0
"Closing down so many attractions at the same time would not have happened in the USA parks. The worker in the hotel did their best to make our stay as good as they could. Be careful if you get given a room as far away from the breakfast as we did, you need a scooter when ever you go to your room. Although the queues look extremely long for breakfast all the way up both staircases, the line goes down quite fast. My biggest disappointment was how many people were smoking all around the parks, even in the queues. No signs or staff to put a stop to it, fag ends everywhere.",0
"Our children are slightly older and so we were disappointed to find that some of the best rides were closed and many of the restaurants were also closed. This meant that the things to do were limited and all the crowds were funnelled towards the same attractions, meaning large queues for everything. It started to feel like a cattle market with people just being herded between the rides. The best things were the parades and liv shows and the early bird priority ticket was also good. One day was plenty of time to do everything we wanted to do.",0
"We were there on a rainy day on a Wednesday, so it wasn't that crowded. We had fun, but sometimes it's just to much to wait 30min for a 1min ride with a two years old. Could be much more efficient. We knew, it's expensive, but that much upselling with ridiculous prices for pictures felt like a scam. It's still worth it going there once.",0
"My husband and I have just returned from a five day visit over the Christmas vacation. We stayed at a Disney hotel so we're able to walk to the park, security getting into the park was excellent with no moans by anyone that we could here and the security men were fast and pleasant.On entry to the park you get the big Disney wow, the castle is a wonder to look at, don't forget to go after dark when it us lit up in a beautiful purple. Most of the attractions were open but long term closures are detailed on the park programme which can be picked up at the entrance. The park was very full resulting in queues of 60 minutes being the norm and the fast pass system on each attraction was usually closed by lunch time. Our biggest gripe was with the food, the standard of the dishes and the price. Almost all the outlets served totally 'junk' food with a token salad available, I had three or four salads and they were all limp and virtually tasteless. The choice was burgers meat and chicken, chicken nuggets, fish burgers and endless salt covered fries. We eventually found a place by Big Thunder Mountain that served meat balls, chilli, pasta and a very tasty corn soup. The choice of cold drinks was mostly sweet carbonated coke, Fanta, & iced tea. In all food outlets and the hotels the hot drinks came from the same machine, all the coffees tasted the same and the hot chocolate was so sweet that one mouthful put my glucose levels, I am diabetic, sky high.The worst thing of all were the food prices, lunch for the two of us was never less than    20 and often much more; it us often cheaper to buy a complete menu which includes extras such as a cake or crisps. The one thing that was worrying to me was if you are vegetarian or diabetic you choice of a meal is diabolical.There were various characters to be seen around the park but in five days there was no sign of Mickey, Minnie, Tigger, Donald, Pooh, Eeyore, in the park but Mickey was in one of the parades.There were plenty of retail outlets with a wide variety of merchandise and I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of most of it. Some of the Christmas decorations were fantastic and the glass blowing by the Disney staff was beautiful.All in all we enjoyed our break, but wouldn't go again mainly because of the food issue.",0
"First visit to Disneyland Paris. Having been to both Disneyland in Anaheim and Disneyworld in Florida I was excited to visit Paris.It was such a disappointment and I wish we had spent the couple of days we had there shopping at outlet stores... I think we would have had more fun (and I don't like shopping!).The park seems so much smaller (it was). The food in the Disneyland district outside was terrible! It was so much a less happier place than the Disneyland in USA.I felt that everyone was just going through their paces & doing there job. There was no  magic  left in these castle walls.I would not go out of my way to visit again.If you have the chance to visit the parks in the USA, grab it",0
"Pros: The Rockin' Roller Coaster, Crush's Coaster, Tower of Terror, Haunted Mansion, Space Mountain are all great rides in Disneyland Paris. The parades are great and firework show is a must see! The lines aren't long.Cons: The park closes very early, 9pm or so. The Disney studios park is very small and it reminds me of Universal Studios Hollywood, but a smaller, not so great version of it. The service isn't good. The food is regular theme park food. They don't have the same amount of merchandise as other parks and have this obsession with Tinkerbell lol. Other Disneyland parks have interesting food like Peanut butter and jelly soda, lobster nachos and Mickey ice creams. The shows can be cheesy.",0
"I had a good experience, however this park is nothing compared to Disney World parks in Florida. I went with my 9 year old son and we were not pleased with the limited amount of roller coaster rides there are for bigger kids and adults.It was a great experience, yet would not go back. ",0
"I visited for 4 days & enjoyed everything on offer. It's my 3rd disneyland after Hong Kong & LA. Whilst it delivered on many fronts there are several where I was let down. The nightly fireworks show is all lasers & imagery on water & light on fireworks. Lasts much longer than other parks but far less spectacular. At other parks I went back night after night, here one viewing sufficed. There were quite a few things closed for renovation, most notably Space Mountain & the large carousel. A disappointment for the kids. Lastly the level of service in the shops was nothing but poor. Very slow & poor performing people. If you're choosing I'd try another disneyland. I travelled from Australia & it's a long way to be let down. Average compared to others. ",0
"If you had been to other Disneyland,be prepared, it is very small. Not that many amusements as the others, and a lot of tourists.....",0
"DIsneyland is great... if you're a billionaire. It's all about the experience, I get that, but I wouldn't come more then once a year. Yesterday I went with my boyfriend and between the tickets (about $200) and the drinks and food we got at the bars and restaurants we must have soent about $400 dollars on our day trip to Disneyland. All in all, the experience was great, but like I said, WAY TOO EXPENSIVE!",0
I didn't really enjoy Disney as much as Cali adventure park next door but still good for little ones as the rides were more suitable for my 3 year old. Still would go just to say that I've been.,0
"I went on multiple weekdays. Still felt overcrowded. Sometimes at the entrance they asked me to go through the metal detector, other times not. I have to admit to being disappointed with my first visit to Disneyland. It's showing its age. Too many attractions were closed, including the monorail.Indiana Jones ride was good. It has a single rider line, which involves two elevator rides, I kid you not. I almost got lost in there. I saw Tangled and Beauty and the Beast, which I both liked. And I saw a nice song and dance show at Fantasyland Theatre. And the Nemo submarine ride was good.If you have a Magic Morning entry you might want to use it for Peter Pan ride as that queue builds up fast. Bus 20 is a free shuttle to the Toy Story parking lot, which is worth taking if your hotel is near there, on South Harbor Blvd.",0
"I visited with my teenage daughter (our 4th visit). Yes, it's a magical experience   the Disney characters, the rides, the parades, the scenery, the Main St atmosphere. However, with Pirates of the Caribbean closed and Big Thunder Mountain out of action for a few hours, the already lengthy queues for the other rides were even longer   waiting an hour or more is unacceptable in my opinion. What's worse, the prices in the shops and restaurants are extortionate. The weak pound doesn't help, but corporate greed does wipe some of the shine from the magical experience.",0
"I can imagine the meeting, let's recreate the fun of the American Disney parks in Europe, how can it go wrong?Well believe me it did go wrong.The rides were fine and just as I had hoped, but my goodness the organisation and attitude of the staff is appalling, the quality of the food poor (I know I'm going to pay over the odds) and availability of snacks and hot drinks awful.Don't go here if it's a prelude to visiting one of the real Disney parks in America, this is a poor imitation and is nothing like the wonderful park experience we are used too with Disney, save a little more money and delay your holiday for a while and go to a proper Disney park. (This is the exact same for the other Paris Disney park)",0
Same rides at Disney Hong Kong. We headed straight for buzz ride. Love it. Went on a few rides. More for younger kids into princesses etc.,0
"Disney needs to do a better job at parking. Since guests pay a premium, non tagged disabled folk have a long way to go in some circumstances. Special kudos to Mark, a parking lot cashier who we managed to go through each day...fast...efficient...pleasant.Wow...at Disney World they used biometric scanners for readmission. At DL they use an iPhone with your picture.Disney is Disney. They make money on food and merchandise. $3 for a bottle of Coke is ridiculous. Take food stuffs into the parks; remember, you are a captive audience. Through put at fast food outlets is slow. The Imagineers are not just creative at attractions but also adept at concealing lines...weaving in and out, under and over. When a wait time is posted, believe it...it's a science. Perhaps some of those water misters like in Las Vegas would keep things cool.Park cleanliness seems to be slipping a bit. They might take a hint from the subways in Paris which use a scented compound to provide a fresher smell.I won't complain about lines; we went at a time when schools were there and also grad nights. Google before you go. Use a smartphone app to get ride times.Some employees are very nice others are smarmy. We also had the dry ice Disney employee bomber while we were there. You just tell your kids,  It's just a dry ice and be glad it's not Mentos and $3 16 oz. Cokes. ",0
"Went to Eurodisney for the 4th time since it opened approx. 20 years ago. Great atmosphere and our daughter loved it. However it is now starting to look tired with some of the attractions looking a little dishevelled and unkempt. Some of the rides closed early for some reason and the runaway train was closed x 3 times due to a fault which really disappointed our little girl. The Pirates of the Caribbean ride is a must as always but this had been changed too so somewhat lost its surprise element as the galleon had been moved. Food was expensive and the staff were a little rude. The best part of the trip was the hotel (not on the park   I will add) but it was approx. a 5 min bus shuttle ride away   the Radisson Blu Hotel was great. The food and facilities were great as was the Spa!. It was approx.   140 a night for a family night whereas a stay at the park would have cost us approx.   400   shocking as it was only the Davey Crocket lodge which is a static caravan! After Eurodisney we went to Paris which is a real must! Visited the Champs Elysees, Arc de Triomphe, the Eifel Tower and Notre Dame   absolutely amazing trip but may miss Eurodisney next time!",0
"I think any kid will enjoy a trip to Disneyland pretty much anywhere in the world. It's hard for a young kid not to enjoy Disneyland. We brought our daughter here several years ago and this trip we have a second child. They both enjoyed the Park but the negative posts are spot on target.Generally the employees there from the restaurants, to just walking around or in the shops seem to really need some better customer service skills. Many seem grumpy and just not happy. We experienced that in the buffet restaurant as well as a few other areas.You wouldn't know there was any European Union crises going on from the crowds here. Very busy from people all over Europe. One thing annoying is you might have to stand in line 45 minutes to take a picture with Winnie the Pooh but part of the long waits results in the fact that they insist on having the official photographer take photos, in the hopes of trying to sell you a    15 photo. It's annoying in this day and age where EVERYONE has their own digital camera that I can't imagine anyone would buy photos unless it was poor lighting conditions like in the Mickey Mouse theatre where they had some weird set up even with flash on the camera the photos didn't turn out right. Also annoying they wait until 7 PM to do the main parade. Years ago, they started earlier. It's almost as if they want you to stay in the park longer to eat, buy stuff, spend money. Our kids still had a great time there but it's no where near the quality as Disneyland related parks in the USA.One thing I'd highly recommend is they have some option to get a deeply discounted ticket if you buy a ticket ahead of time with at least 5 days notice. We are in Paris for one month so this wasn't a problem for us. We were in the Disney store on Champs Elysees and in the basement level they have a stand where you can buy tickets. We were buying tickets there so we didn't have to cue in line at Disneyland when I saw a sign that said it was only    35 each rather than the    72 or so they wanted if you buy normal tickets.I think they also have this option online so you should definitely take this option if you can plan ahead. It's a big discount to the regular prices and I'd think anyone coming to Paris could easily plan ahead. The only downside is you MUST use it the date you pick. If you are sick or it's raining or whatever you can't change the date so keep this in mind.",0
"I have been to Florida on many occasions before going to Paris, I think it's over priced and a lot of the staff are rude. I tried to look at Disneyland Paris as if I have never been before instead of comparing it.It's a shame they sell crappy food, there's only so much junk you can eat. I have been here twice now, Oct 2010 and Nov 2012 and I do not think I would return here. I would rather spend a little bit more to go to USA. I do think if you have never been to America you'll think it's amazing. But if you have been to America you'll think it's a little bit rubbish. It is odd to hear the characters speaking French, only because growing up your used to the English American accent. Not many parades, there's not really any characters around to have pictures taken with. It is pretty and is ok.",0
DO not I repeat do not go during Christmas vacation. The park is way over crowded. I don't know how they can let that many people into confined area. Don't know what good the max pass does you can only make a reservation every 80 minuets. when it is time for you to get to your ride you still have to wait 60 minuets or more. Its USELESS!! The best time to ride the rides is after the fireworks. NO LINES. The last 2 hours was the best part of the day even if it was a bit chilly. If your just wanting to ride rides go else where. ,0
"Our family of 6 got a 1 bedroom suite on the 11th floor of the Paradise Pier Hotel for 3 nights, 4 days in mid June and were reasonably comfortable. The two queen beds were comfortable and having two bathrooms was great. My two youngest daughters decided to forego folding out the sleeper and just sleep on the L shaped sectional and slept well. I give the PP Hotel a rating of 3 for one reason  Grad Nite. Two of the nights we stayed there were grad nites, one if which was at California Adventure. The area's high school grads have access to the park from 10:00 P. M. to 2 A. M. As I was just falling asleep shortly after midnight, the music started and did not stop until 1:59 A. M. (The music was loud enough that ANY hotel bordering California Adventure would have its walIs thumping.) I thought I would just sleep in and let the others enjoy the Magic Morning entry, but at 5:30 that morning, someone at DCA conducted a sound check which was just as loud as the music a few hours before. Take my advice and ask if either park is hosting Grad Nite on any of the nights you are staying.",0
"We expected queues....and to be honest, day 1 in the Disney park wasn't too bad ( a Monday), we got on most things ( with a 5 and 8 year old)... It's nice that the park really goes quiet after 8pm. Get your fast passes for thunder mountain as that is pretty much the only family roller coaster you can ride on ( space mountain has a strict 1.3m height). Be prepared to be ripped off for coffees, popcorn etc but go with the flow ( we sneaked sandwiches and crisps in). Day 2   universal studios....what a LET DOWN...hubby and I came here 10 years ago add it hasn't changed....massive queues for everything. You can only get fast passes for about 3 rides, and the kids rides in toy story land had HUGE queues. The toilets were smelly and wet floors after 2pm, avoid...and the food facilities were over crowded and some were shut...seriously Disney, this is not what we expect for a busy August visit, after spending 500 euros for a family of 4 for 2 days. The studio tour is absolutely rubbish ...not a patch on the Florida tour....the only decent part was the burning tanker....other than that, it's not worth the hour or so queue. My advice....run in early, grab a fast lass for tower of terror as that is the only amazing thing at universal, and spend the rest if the day in Disney. Don't get me wrong, we had run, but the studios is busy busy busy, and quite stressful.",0
"The main objective was to take lots of photos with Disney characters. We were hoping to see lots of them.However we were really disappointed as we were not greeted by any Disney characters, nor could we see any of them walking around the park! Only saw Minnie mouse in a    ring    and I joined the queue to take a photo with her, but left the queue halfway through because it was taking toooooo long.We did see all of them in a parade through, but that   s not the same as walking around in the midst of them.Without the Disney characters walking around, Disneyland just seems so unreal and unmagical.",0
"I don't know if I'm just too old for it now, but it just feels run down compared to Disney World. The characters are, of course, top notch and the rides are fun. I was definitely able to get through it in one day which saved me some money so I could buy the  must have  mickey ears. Would still be a magical and wondrous place if I were still a kid but for the money, I'm taking my kids to Florida instead.",0
"Hong Kong Disneyland is what you would expect from Disneyland worldwide   well decorated and several various theme parks. The hardware is there as it   s standardised globally   however on the soft services, I find it difficult to have rests in between rides (the wait for each of the rides could be as long as 30  minutes). Not that many vendor choices for quick rests. Number of washrooms are available but some require lengthy walks   so not the most convenient for children of younger ages. Majority of the resting seats in the parks are fully exposed under the sun without shades so it could be easily sunburned if visit the park without hats or umbrella. Majority of the F&B stops do not offer A C (but is open air) so it can be unbearable during heated summer time   do come prepared with light clothes and umbrella, hats, sunglasses and sunblocks. We already tried to beat the crowd by being the first to arrive the park, but more than a dozen tour groups arriving with large tour buses also planned the same and their stops are immediately in front of the park entrance whereas for private car park guests would need to walk further to arrive the entrance   just be mindful to wear very comfortable shoes as a lot of walking is required during the entire visit. ",0
Luckily it was not a very crowded day despite being labour day public holiday in HK. However some rides still requires queuing time of around 1 hour. The free fast past is very helpful and would be great if it is available to more rides.There is only about 3 trilling rides for adults and hence insufficient. The air conditioned toilets were heavenly in the hot and humid HK weather.Transport to and fro is very convenient with the MTR and price is reasonable.,0
"Visited this theme park on 26.02.19. Overall, it was okay. Nothing spectacular. I have previously been to Disneyland Anaheim, Disney World Florida, Disneyland Paris, Tokyo Disneyland Disneysea. HK Disneyland is tiny, but fortunately not many crowds. The haunted house (mystic manor) was weird, though. I would expect something along the lines of other Disneyland parks, but yeah maybe it   s a cultural thing (nothing beats haunted house in Universal Studios Singapore during Halloween Horror Nights, fyi). Overall, my kids had fun there. Main reason why we went to Disneyland.",0
"Same lay out as all of the other parks I've visited (Hong Kong, Orlando) so easy to navigate around the food was limited and vastly over priced the queuing for the princesses was excessive with lots of unhelpful staff working to rule on time schedules that were unrealistic.most queues for rides were not too bad, but it was late July and raining so most people stayed away. ",0
"Hong Kong Disneyland shouldn't really be advertised as Disneyland haha. It's super small and while it is very cute, it was just a little sad. Tomorrow land isn't really tomorrow land, more like tomorrow corner. Space mountain isn't as cool. No splash mountain, no Haunted Mansion :( Staff weren't really friendly, a bit cold. Just kinda strange experience. You can't go into the castle, no Peter Pan ride! Haha other than that it's not really as expensive to get in, and it is very fun to go to Disneyland in another country right? So go and have fun, but be prepared. Hope this helps!! :)",0
"So no one can accuse me of playing favorites, I'll start by letting u know I'm from Illinois. I've never lived in Florida or California. A woman asked me yesterday while standing in line for fast passes which was better. I didn't hesitate, Fl by far is better! I love Disney, have taken my children numerous times in the last 12years. Usually we go to Florida but twice we have made the trek to CA.   the good about CA, both parks are within walking distance of the Grand Californian Hotel. In fact the Ca park has a hotel entrance which I love. Also liked the spa on the property(received an excellent facial). That's the end of what's good about Disney CA compared to FL. Staff at park, hotel and restaurants are not nice!!! They just don't seem to care at all. Seriously snarky people! Only one extra magic hour in morn. None in eve. (Mind you They're were some staff that were excellent, the ride man on tower of terror,hostess at one of the restaurants) but on a whole the staff was bad, a lot just looked like they were done with this place and need a new job. Not helpful,not well trained, not happy. Seriously not used to this at Disney. If you are planning a trip to Disneyland you need to seriously consider Disneyworld so much better! More rides, kinder, caring staff, more to see. U of have to ride buses, boats or monarails to most parks but well worth it!",0
"Went there in July 2017. The weather was very hot and the park was extremely crowded. I recommend you to buy tickets and meals voucher via online to get the best price. Nothing special, just a normal experience in a theme park. Honestly, I preferred USS more since it is more fun for adults.",0
"We LOVE Disneyland. Bibbidy Bobbidy Boutique was great! Rides are great, but there are SOOO many improvements they can make. The Disney World fast pass system and plastic tickets is SOOO much better. We got SCREWED with Minnie's breakfast in the park. Even with a reservation, they said there was no room for us inside and then only half of the characters came outside to see us, and I had to go and beg for those. VERY disappointed in that. Most of the staff was great!",0
"The attractions continue to please my daughter   she continues to adore the Haunted Mansion and Pirates of the Caribbean rides, but became entranced by Peter Pan and the Snow White rides as well, and enjoyed the Jolly Roger boat. She was suitably terrified by the Thunder Mountain train ride for which she is just tall enough. But the food was awful and over priced and service takes forever. Bring your own. My daughter met the princesses for one lunch   good, but was late to Cafe Mickey for breakfast the next day. The manager refused to even give her a glass of milk. Dreadful, but made worse by the fact that we had booked the breakfast for the previous morning and had learnt that the date had been changed without our consent when we arrived at Hotel Cheyenne the previous day! We figured she, aged three, would be tired and ratty after watching the beautiful night show but for whatever reason the date was changed and Disney have not yet responded to my complaint. The hotel were great with luggage we left behind transferring it to the Disney Express service, which I recommend.",0
"We were really excited about visiting Disneyland. We might be adults on our honeymoon   but Disneyland is for everyone! We did have a pretty good time, and were there most of the day. But we spent a LOT of our time standing in queues, to enter the park, to go on any of the rides (even when fast tracked), even just to eat at the restaurants. We got so tired just standing doing nothing and it was a quick buzz kill. We went on a Thursday in spring, which I thought shouldn't be too busy, but the place was sooo crowded, I couldn't imagine what it would be like on a weekend in summer. I'd love to go back, but I couldn't handle the crowds.",0
"I have always dreamed of going to Disneyland and was excited that we had booked tickets. When we booked, we booked and payed extra for a specific kind of ticket that allowed us to  skip the line  if you will. The first ride we got on, our tickets allowed us to go straight to the front of the ride which was excellent and we assumed this would continue throughout the day. The next ride we lined up to go on, when we scanned our tickets, instead of allowing us on the ride, it gave us a set time to return to the ride and then we would be allowed to ride immediately. This would have worked great if the tickets were able to sync our  booked  rides, but we found that many of our ride  bookings  overlapped which resulted in only riding three rides throughout the entire day which isn't ideal as we are older and the rides were the only thing we were interested in doing there.Besides that, the park has a great atmosphere, awesome rides and yummy food. Taxi's were easy to hail out the front when we were ready to leave and there were a few cute souvenir stores.",0
"This is the 2nd time I've been to Hongkong Disneyland. 1st time was in 2007.Not much changes except for some new rides. A new garden is in the making (yet to open).Typical kiddy rides. Its more fun when there's a kid around.2 rides that's more fun in my opinion: Space mountain and Parachute.The crowd is atrocious. Too many people in the theme park. Can forget about photo taking with Disney characters. The queue is very long too. Conclusion: Visit HK disneyland once will do. Even after 8 years to revisit, there's no surprise element in the themepark.",0
I have been to Tokyo and LA Disneyland!I also visited this disneyland back in 2006.Back in 2006 i was disappointed as it was very small but after 12 years its been well and truly expanded!Only thing missing for me was Toon town but a great day or 2 can be had for people with young children under 12.2 day pass was around $400 AUD for 2 adults and 2 kids!Worth the visit if you have never been before.Suggest train,0
"It was fun to take the kids once just so they can say they have been. This trip was ridiculous. Apparently it's grad month and there are half naked teens running loose all over the place with loads of pda. I spent most of the time covering my preteen sons eyes and plugging their ears. My 17 year old daughter was even offended. Everywhere you looked butt cheeks, hohaa's and breasts where hanging out. And the cuss words where in over drive. Several girls had on loose tank tops with no bra on. Disney needs to do better job keeping visitors in check with clothing and language. This is supposed to be a family park G rated and this was defiantly X rated. The express pass we got to use on one ride. It's a great concept but you have to have it for 2 hrs before you can scan fir another ride. By the time you do that the other ride is out of passes. There was vomit in several places. They tried keeping the park clean but just couldn't keep up. The price of food is outrageous. We had 7  6 inch hot dogs, 7 small cokes and 7 small chips and it was 95.00. After paying 700.00 for tickets paying almost 100 per meal will kill a budget pretty quick. We missed riding 18 rides because the lines where so long for the other rides. Highly recommend getting on Indian jones and pirates of the Caribbean. ",0
"1) very small theme park  2) easy to walk around  3) dont have to get the 2 day pass, 1 day is more than sufficient  4) the evening fireworks at 8pm is worth the visit",0
Just got back from disneyland paris and wasnt that impressed with the parks the park themselves are trying to recreate the style there american counterpart's have to offer but thats where it ends the fact thag people can smoke anywhere in the parks instead of having specific areas its like walking around in a giant ashtray with cigarette ends everywhere and discarded rubbish most of the fast pass machines where out of order and didnt see many characters around the park except for meet mickey in fantasyland the plus side for the park is the show at the end this is done very well. The hollywood studios park was very enjoyable especially cinemacique the tower of terror I would put on a par with orlando and the cars camera action show is a good watch. I also didnt feel comfortable walking around at night with my daughter why do they need armed soldiers walking around the carparks and train station also thd sellers selling there cheap 1 euro tat spread out on blankets outside the park exit. Come on europe look at your american counterpart's and grab a few ideas afterall is disnry is meant to be a magical experience I for 1 will stick with orlando.,0
"We were staying 30 minutes away for a conference, and decided to check out Disneyland since it was so close. They say October is the off season, but it is still crowded!! A lot of the rides we wanted to ride were down for maintenance, so it was pretty disappointing. Space Mountain was decked out for Halloween, and was by far my fave ride. It was interesting to see the differences between the same rides offered at DisneyWorld and Disneyland. We did not get the park hopper pass to include California Adventure... kind of wish we would have just gone in to that park over Disneyland... newer rides and alcoholic beverages. At least I can check Disneyland (the original) off my bucket list. I highly prefer DisneyWorld, hands down!! ",0
"If you have been to Anaheim Disneyland then don't waste your time here :( Sorry sounds harsh but it is harsh no real rides or atmosphere its just plain old dull i got more enjoyment out of discovering Hong Kongs underground rail system On a brighter note it is extremely organised, clean, and queues were short did not see any express ticket lines maybe they didnt need them for the teacup merry go round We took our own lunch but there was plenty of places to buy lunch Great for the kids , personally myself give me the real thing you cannot substitute the real Disneyland ",0
"It is extremely expensive and not a viable option for middle income or lower.  Go with a full wallet, at least a week's wages for one day.",0
"Took our grandson for the 1st time, he's 5. I was really surprised at the lack of Disney characters that we did not see walking around in the park. Food is so so over priced there. Our grandson still had an awesome time but he so wanted to see Buzz light year & never did. Only got to get 9 autographs of Disney characters. Disappointed!!!",0
" The Disney part it's great, the French organization part it's very poor  this sentence tells all.If you ever have been at Florida Disney you know what i mean.The magic is there. The attention to the little details and the Disney characters are also there. The attractions are good and similar to the America park. The problem is the complete lack of organizations, the workers almost always with no smiles and long faces and the loss of quality time that leaves.The qeues are bigger because they are not well organized. I strongly suggest the workers to take a learnig trip to Orlando. Or to bring the Orlando workers here.And the prices for everything inside the park are very steep.Overall i enjoyed but if you want to see the real Disney go to Orlando.",0
"As someone who has been to pretty much all Disney parks around the world, I found the Paris one quite disappointing. Space Mountain was being refurbished, which was a big shame. The advertised queue lengths were consistently wrong, with the wait often being double of what the park was predicting. Some of the rides are in really poor shape (Star Tours in particular stuck in my mind), with gaffer tape covering bits which are coming off. Staff were generally OK but not particularly welcoming. We did have a good time, but wouldn   t go back.",0
First time to Disneyland. I'll take Disneyworld any day. Disneyland was insanely crowded. How they cram that many people with strollers and handicap vehicles in that place is hard to believe.,0
"I went with a girlfriend, both of us 30 (22 years ago). It was fun, but... honestly, I wish we'd had  a couple of Disney crazed kids in tow...",0
"My husband and I visited Disneyland Paris on Monday   I'm a big Disney fan and was really looking forward to seeing what the Paris park would be like! We had a fabulous day, we don't have any kids, and managing our fast pass well we were able to do everything we wanted in about 8 hours. It was a lot of fun and we loved the Hyperspace Mountain. (Skip Buz Lightyear if you don't have kids, it was boring and not worth the wait).There's definitely some improvements to be made   signage is minimal, it's really hard to find anything apart from the rides. They need more 'Disney' food. Staff engagement seems really low, we only met one cast member who smiled, the rest seemed upset to be there. I'd love it if the shopping outlets could be on the map, all the stores are rather repetitive and I spent all day looking for the Christmas shop, only to find it at 10.30pm after it was closed. The illuminations show at night is spectacular! Definitely stay for that if you can.It's really easy to get out to the park on the train, if you stay for illuminations there's still a train after it...but they close down most of the station and only have one entrance open which isn't signed. It's at the front of the building not at the side where the busses are.Overall I'd recommend going if you love Disney and have time while you're in Paris. If you've got lots on your list and can visit a US park then feel comfortable in giving it a miss.",0
"Purchase your ticket beforehand. The queues to enter are long, but the queue for tickets is SUPER long. Not many great rides, very kiddish. Suitable for 8 and below. The best ride was Hyperspace Mountain. Book your fast pass time immediately  there are only 3 rides available for fast pass. Download the mobile app   it will tell you the queue times for each ride and all the show times. Don't miss the parade at night, and the fireworks  quite spectacular. Super super a lot of ppl, and super hot! ",0
"I'm sorry to say Disneyland Park just wasn't my thing. As a family we are not really into the whole ride thing, so that didn't appeal. My son loved the Jedi training academy and the Star Wars ride (mind you he got a fast pass at 10am so that he could ride at 6pm that day!!!).Assimo the robot show was very interesting as was the Tomorrow land exhibits. The train trip around the park was interesting and gave a good overview perspective. It is a very slick operation without a doubt   everything is clean and spotless and well organised. The Grand Parads was impressive   I couldn't help thinking that a lot of the floats and shows were geared more towards girls   lots of princesses, sleeping beauty etc.... Very crowded when we went   but it was in the middle of the US summer break (so we expected it). Lots of merchandise (which means   lots of pester power).....It's a once in a life time experience that's for sure.....Luckily you can come and go over several days with a 3 day pass (we purchased the Southern California Pass which worked well for us). Food was the usual fare   hot dogs, burgers, chicken, churros, fries, soda etc.... some fruit carts, ice creams etc.",0
"We (2 adults, 4 year old child) visited only Disney Land Park (not Studios) on quiet day, but there were 20 40min. queues everywhere, which was frustrating. Food was also bad and expensive. It was quite weird, that the same food (especially bad coffee and lame bakings) was offered everywhere in park though the cafees and restaurants were so different and well set up. Indeed I came to suspect, that e.g. Nestle and Buttoni (frozen pizzas) are paying to Disney corp. for serve their products as promotional purposes. I gave 3 5 despite of too long queues and bad food, because me and my family really liked the park's atmosphere and attractions. For us there was indeed too much to do in single park in one day because of the small child. Next time have to leave her to hotel : )",0
"I had heard wonderful reports of the Disneyland experience from friends with very similarly aged children   talk of pure magic, the staff putting themselves out, lots of  Disney Magic Moments .....thats simply not how it is in France. Yes, some of the staff were lovely but many were simply disinterested or surly. I found the nicest staff to be in the shops. The prices were awful   we were there during a heatwave and drinks were all overpriced and very small   150mls for orange juice for the children. There are water fountains but the water is not nice to drink.Many of the  big ticket  rides had technical problems whilst we were there, making the queues longer.On the plus side   in general our children had a good time   there were enough thrills for the thrill seeker and my smaller ones loved Dumbo and the Mad Hatters tea party. Our hotel   The Sequoia Lodge   was very nice and the swimming pool there was wonderful   the children were more excited by that than anything really.I have to say I expected far more  magic , far more characters around the park, better service, a lot of going  above and beyond  which really didn't happen.I doubt that the lack of  magic  is what Walt envisaged. Everyone tells me that I should give it another go and save for Orlando, frankly having been to France I don't want to give them any more money..!",0
"It's OK. We've visited on a wednesday, it was crowed. The place it's small for the amount of people, and the rides are few. If you have visited Disneyland or Disney World, you'll probably get disappointed.",0
"We prepaid for our tickets and, when we arrived, there wasn't anyone at the entry point to guide patrons where to go with their vouchers. Most of us ended up in the wrong line, and only found out after waiting and then had to go through yet another line. A better process to include signage would be appreciated. It felt like unneeded stress not only on guests but also on Disney's employees. We had purchased fast passes which proved ineffective on most of the popular rides. In the 7 hours that we were there, we were only able to get on 4 rides (average duration of ride was 15 minutes). The parks were incredibly crowded and there were lines everywhere to include their restaurants which was uncomfortable. We ended up sitting on a wall eating our lunch. Even though there are designated smoking areas, many people were smoking in all areas as if allowed.In true Disney fashion the grounds were impeccable and beautifully landscaped. Bottom line is that if you've been to both parks in the US, I would skip Disneyland Paris.",0
"We had a lovely day here, but certainly did not need a second day (Gold Coast theme parks have just as much, if not more to offer). We enjoyed the Jungle river boat ride and the treehouse. We skipped the little kids section, as we were travelling with a 12 y o. The food, like most theme parks was expensive and deep fried. The Disney characters were great, but long lines for a photo. The transport system out the front is exceptional and the surrounding areas are immaculate!",0
"I visited the week of Christmas and the lines were ridiculously long and there were many rides that were closed. We did get to ride some of the smaller ones and those were fun. Prepare to do a lot of walking... a lot. The castle itself is nicer than the one in Orlando imho because you can actually enter this castle and walk around it. I thought that aspect was pretty neat. My daughter felt like a princess roaming around the castle. The Princess show performed in front of the castle was fun to watch and it was sung in different languages. Many people there speak English so that wasn't a problem. I will say though that the line to enter the park was chaotic and completely unorganized. As a matter of fact, there was no line, just hundreds of people pushing each other to try to get through the gate. Other than that, the park itself is beautiful and with some organization and actual open rides, it can be a really fun place.",0
"Half term week and we were surprised that not that many characters were around. But, usual fun had by all. Fantasyland had the most to do. Quite a few rides shut down which is not acceptable during half term. Lots of food outlets shut too which meant looooong queues for anything to eat or drink. The new parade is a lot shorter than the old one and the characters just don't seem to be as accessible   they used to get off the floats and come and meet the crowds, now they just sit and wave.The evening firework show is stunning, but get a good spot as need to be able to see the castle   not just the sky as we thought.",0
"We are Disney fanatics. One of the big reasons for going to Paris was to see DLP! And we were, I am sad to say, disappointed. Although there are some very cool rides, and the Disneyland Park itself is very pretty, it lacks the magic of the US parks. Staff are not at all friendly (such a stereotype, but it is true), the Studios park is quite ugly and poorly themed, and crowd control is zero. There are several rides that are certainly worth going to  and really, they DO make the trip worthwhile, just be prepared for an experience where guests are viewed as some sort of irritating nuisance. NO ONE will tell you to have a magical day here. We had seasons passes  and I had to FIGHT to get them because I kept my maiden name, my husband hadn't joined us, and the staff refused to believe that my children were mine. It was a nightmare experience.GREAT RIDES AT STUDIOS: Ratatouille is well worth it! IT is a very innovative dark ride. We ate at the restaurant and it was very poor, and we waited for two hours beyond our reservation... but the d  cor is very very well done. The ride makes you feel that you actually are a tiny mouse in a French kitchen! The queue is breathtaking... you wait on the rooftops of Paris. I would return to Disneyland just for this queue.CRUSHES COASTER: the lines are terrible, even at rope drop expect to wait up to an hour. but.. the ride is astonishing! It blends a dark ride with an indoor coaster and my kids couldn't get enough. Rude ride operators questioned my daughter if she was 7 every time we rode, but other than that we loved this ride. Even the queue is cool, you wait on a pier in Sydney. It perfectly simulates the experience of riding the current with the turtles from Finding Nemo.TOWER OF TERROR: my kids hated the one in Orlando... this is an abbreviated version, and just right for my kids... it has the drop thrill but less of the ghost story.ATTRACTIONS WORTH SEEING AT DISNEYLAND PARK:Big Thunder Mountain Railroad: this is the longest version of this ride at any Disney park... and you can tell! three lift hills of awesome family fun! We rode this 50 times last summer. Pirates of the Caribbean: this blends the gorgeous queue of the Orlando park with the long ride of the California park... and it includes a few big surprises! Our favorite version of this ride.Disney Dreams: the nighttime show is great... but we waited 2 hours to see it and still didn't have the best seats. Disney needs to improve viewing for this show and perhaps introduce a fastpass for a viewing area. It was not fun to wait 2 hours... one night we showed up a mere 90 minutes early and there was no hope that we would get a spot to sit to see the show.Walk Throughs: there are some cool ones here  Jules Verne's submarine, Aladdin, an Alice in Wonderland walk through... neat stuff.It is super easy to get to from Paris  there is one train that goes directly to the entrance, it was never crowded and always air conditioned. I would never stay at this resort  the staff are far too unfriendly, and the access from the city of Paris is just too convenient (you are deposited from the train very few steps from the front gate)",0
"Overpriced, too busy, even on a weekday. Spent all day and only got to ride two or three rides. Definitely not worth the price.",0
"I don't know what happened, but the  cast members  are some of the unhappiest people I have ever seen. Their sullen looks eventually get to you. Does anyone ever smile here? Disney markets their Disney Institute on business improvement, yet it appears that they do not practice what they preach. Too bad, it would greatly improve the guests experience to see some cast members who appear to enjoy where they work.",0
"Stayed at Disneyland just after Christmas. Have been to Disneyland Florida a couple of times but was expecting a scaled down version of the USA. I could not have been more wrong. As you entered the park we were really impressed lovely set out and main street was brill. That's where it stopped. This park is under funded and everything is out of date! The end of the night show was OK but it was a light show with minimal fireworks so was a little disappointed. I think the attractions were as old as the park itself even with a Michael Jackson themed ride... COME ON.... I don't think there was a time when all the rides were working with the pirates of the Caribbean breaking down on a daily basis. The staff were miserable, the prices were astronomical. I do expect to pay more for everything when you go to Disney but the premium you pay is for everything to be Disney this was sadly not the case, the food was average with poor service, the souvenirs are 40% dearer than bought from Disney in the UK. Do yourselves a favour, save your money and go to Florida",0
We went early October. This was supposed to be the low season... The place was packed and very hot. Where are all the Disney characters?.. You would see one occasionally but they would rush along hardly stopping to meet the kids. We went to Disneland Paris 8 years ago when my teenager daughters were 7&8. They got every characters autograph and had photos taken...not in Aneheim. the park is looking very old in some parts but still great fun. pity some rides were closed. Wouldn't go to this park again...maybe Orlando. ,0
"I have been to Disney World in Florida several times and recently went to Disneyland in California for the first time. The park was not nearly as good as I expected it to be. It was extremely crowded (despite what I had heard about it being less crowded than Magic Kingdom in FL). We waited in long lines FIVE times, only to get almost to the front of the line to hear,  Ladies and Gentlemen, we are experiencing mechanical difficulties.  What a waste of time! The parade and fireworks at the end of the day were great, but I was still disappointed overall at how SO many rides weren't working.Next time, I'll be going back to Florida.",0
Customer Service here has really gone down hill. The park is not as clean as it use to be from prior visits.   We come here at least 1 time a year and the kids love it. But you can really notice the cut backs.,0
I have a disability and qualify for disabled access pass to rides. I love that Disney offers this but they need to streamline the process. The whole point is to make me have to stand less but there's 6 deep lines at every desk to get the pass for the next ride. ,0
"Just returned from a family break with children and grandchildren, we all had a cabin each at Davy Crocket ranch, could not fault it. It was clean, spacious, well maintained and plenty of facilities. You collect your continental breakfast from huts and take it back to your cabin, the grandchildren loved it. The only thing that spoilt the trip was the attitude of the staff at the disney parks, they are miserable they couldn't care less if they serve you or not, they are very slow at everthing they do and the body lanuage shows that they are very un happy at what they are doing. In the Blockbuster cafe in the Disney studios one supervisor made the cashier cry as she was serving us. Although the staff done their best to try and spoil are beak we still had a great time. If there are any unemployed chefs go out to Eurodisney and show them how to cook, the food is terrible.",0
"The littles loved it but it's very expensive, loads of queues and waiting. Not as big as Orlando obviously but has some of the same features. Some parts are closed for refurb at present so check website when booking. Watch out for people begging on way in.",0
"For some reason the Park only opens from 8 10am for those lucky enough to stay in a Disney hotel for the rest of us it opens at 10am when the queues for rides were already 60mins long. There were far too many people in the park for the available rides and waiting time were an average 60 80 mins, even the Fast pass machines closed within minutes of opening. The rides were plagued with breakdowns and we were waiting for rides then got turned away because they closed then had to start queuing all over again making it nearly 2  3 hour wait. The whole 3 days were like this although to be fare 1 day was mostly due to thunderstorms. There is an extreme lack of seating so you have to sit on pavements to get a rest. The illuminations were fantastic and in my opinion the only part worth seeing the reason for the average review rather than poor, but they are not on until 11pm so you have to sit on the concrete for at least 2 hours to get a decent view. There is just no seating and at the rides they could do with the flip down seats as 2 hours is a long wait standing up. To be honest I wouldn't go back. It mostly about retail and the restaurants are so expensive, take a packed lunch dinner or you'll spend a fortune. The Disney characters come out several times a day and you will have to queue for about an hour as well.",0
"I went in March with my family , 2 boys  7 years old and 13 years old, and my husband.We stayed in one of the Disney hotels which was great, but the Disney park was a bit disappointing . We were about to end up in hospital after we bought some doughnuts and ...they were mouldy....they were selling them after the expiry date :((I don't want to imagine what could have happened if my son would had eaten those doughnuts!!!!How is possible that such a big resort is selling expired food? I am sure they have people who check the food , and everybody nowadays , who serve or sell food have to have Food and Hygiene course where you study how to store food, to check the temperature, check the expiry date, etc.However, the guest services gave us a refund , but when they called the owner of the shop who sold the doughnuts, he apologised, but he stole the doughnuts,he thought that we are going to make a big fuss about it and that was the evidence.My son could end up with food poisoning and really ill!!!Very scary and disappointing. Apart from that, we enjoyed the show at the end and some of the rides are very good. My advice will be : watch what you eat!",0
"I went there once and I was less than impressed. I did get to see many of the characters, but I am not really into that anymore and was more interested in the rides but the lines are long (to be expected).The entry fee is super high and food in there is expensive (even bottled water).Take your kids, but save $$ so you can afford all the things they might ask for.",0
"It was fun for the kids, the entry line to get in was so congested. You would think if we were there with National American Miss that we would have a special entrance but Nope!",0
"I took my two grandchildren who were 10 and 11 and I have to say they enjoyed it, but I really think they would have been equally happy with a few day trips to themes parks here. The whole thing feels a bit lacklustre. Thunder mountain and the boats were closed and during our time there on five occasions major rides were closed as they had technical problems. And that was after we had queued for I dont know how long. I went there when it first opened when it felt Disneyish but the absolute crassness of the disney shops on every concievable corner really spoils it. If they took out all the shops then the park would be a third of the size. I dont think disney have put as much energy into developing the park as they could and it feels old fashioned in a non CGI way. The one thing that really made me cross though was the food prices. I paid   45 for three small pizzas and drinks and clearly even with the poor pound thats extortion when there isnt anywhere to buy snacks or stuff to make a picnic. In one of the restaurants I paid nearly one hundred for me and the children. With snacks and drinks, the food bill was at least 120 per day and thats not including breakfast. On the positive side, The Disney express from Ashford was great. Home to Disney in four hours without the airport hassle and they dealt with the luggage. My highlights were the fireworks and light show and the Wild west show which was worth the money. The kids liked the indiana jones and pirates of the caribbean rides.",0
"I made my first trip to Disneyland nearly 40 years ago and have been 4 or 5 times since then, as recently as 10 years ago. I've also been to Disney World 3 or 4 times. This most recent trip brought back some fond memories, but I though some of the original Disney esqe touches have been lost. Other's have spoken of the crowds, lines and cost. Disney's PR department seemed to blow it by dramatically raising the park hopper prices three weeks before a new section of California Adventure Park was to open. Seemed greedy. Also there website information was spotty (how do parking shuttles work?), and to have not warned about Grad Night's mobs was very inconsiderate.But I found myself disappointment in the cross marketing of virtually everything. Woody and Jessie show up in Small World. Swiss Family Robinson's tree house is not Tarzan's treehouse and not nearly as whimsical. Even the  Jack Sparrow  additions to Pirates of the Caribbean seemed cheezy. Plus, we experienced several ride breakdowns.No doubt, many of the rides are still spectacular. Our family loved Space Mountain, the Haunted Mansion, Thunder Mtn Railroad, even the cheesy Jungle Cruise, plus we enjoyed the newer rides at CA Park, California Screaming, Soaring over California, among others.I think I would recommend Disney World over Disneyland. One person told us that with the annual passes for locals, it's become a  teen hangout  like the mall, so it's always crowded. Also Disney World, being larger, seems to absorb the crowds better. (Best DL advice, go early in the morning and hit as much as possible as fast as possible, then slow down and accept that there will be lines later in the day.)If you can't make Disney World and want the Disney experience, by all means, go to Disneyland. But know what you are getting into. And for goodness sake, avoid Grad Nights.",0
"My husband and I love Disneyland, Anaheim and go at least once a year. While in London on a two week vacation, we decided to invest (yes it cost us that much) in a day trip to Disneyland Paris on the Eurostar. We only had 5hrs in the park. Luckily for us, it wasn   t a busy day and we didn   t have to wait in super long lines. I found that the Disney Experience was lacking. It felt like an amusement park and not the total immersion into the Happiest Place on Earth, I get in Anaheim. It might be attributed to the fact that we only had 5hrs and ran from ride to ride, trying to catch all the differences between the parks. One thing that really bothered us, was that all the indoor rides; Haunted House, Pirates, Space Mtn were hot and stuffy. They definitely needed to turn on the air conditioners! We were there May 7 2008.We are shoppers and love Disney merchandise and were surprised we had a hard time finding something to purchase as a souvenirs. When we go to Anaheim, we struggle picking which of several items to buy. You   d think you could find Mickey related Eiffel Tower   s, but that proved to be quite the chore. We may go back, one day, spend a few days at the resort to give it another chance. Besides, my new favorite rollercoaster is there   .Rock n Roller coaster featuring Aerosmith. Previously my favorite was California Screamin in Anaheim! I have to go back one day! IT WAS AWESOME!",0
"Disneyland has its charm, but it is disappointing to be charged full price when large swaths of the park are not operating properly. The park experienced multiple ride malfunctions during our stay, which on one day affected every fast pass we had. On all days, these glitches shutdowns which spanned every major attraction that was opened, created unusually long lines which resulted in fast pass holders having to wait an hour or more. In addition, Fantasmic remains closed. This was a major disappointment as between the fireworks show and Fantasmic, the latter is the better show. The lagoon has been refilled (or at least it appears to be) and the two boats are sailing again, but construction continues in the back areas which appears to affect the logistics of the show. I'm told by Cast Members that the area under development is about 16 acres in size and will host a new themed area of the park. While it should be wonderful when it opens, it adversely affects a number of attractions now. Lastly, both the monorail and the train are closed, so for those with mobility issues (including two in our party), one may have to walk the length of Downtown Disney just to get to the park...and then find there is no functioning transportation within the park. This was a significant inconvenience    but the Monorail should be back very shortly (if not tomorrow). The train within the park will be longer in returning. ",0
Overall it was exciting for a kid to go to Disney.Kind of feels like suitable for kids younger than 10 and slightly more towards girls who were into the shows etc. 10 year old boy just wanting rides and too many of them were shut down for renovations and the ones that were open knock your head around a lot as they are old and clunky. Rocket one actually hurt our heads so would recommend people to stay away from.,0
"This place would be better suited to parents with younger kids, probably around the 5 to 15 year old age group. Maybe it was a case of having it too good for to long, but Australians were previously able to purchase a 14 day pass for about $250. Now we get a 5 day pass for about $330 so we probably were not mentally ready for the 'Happiest place on earth', when you feel like you've been had. I emailed Disney regarding the new fees and was told that it was due to public surveys that the prices and tickets were altered. Sorry Disney, I'm not buying that. But the place is very clean, tidy and well run. Be prepared to have your photo taken at the gates so you cant give your ticket to anyone to use. If you like standing in the Sun for 2 hours to get a fast pass for the CARS ride, so that you can come back six hours later and jump on another line with your fast pass and wait another hour for the CARS ride, this place is perfect.",0
"Disneyland has lots of cool rides. I think, for what you get, the admission price is reasonable.However, expect to pay a lot for food & drinks and expect very long lines at the more popular attractions. Fastpass doesn't work as well as you might think. Parking close to the park is very expensive. Staff seemed jaded but friendly overall.",0
"If you have been to the park in LA then i wouldn't even bother, it is almost identical.The park is quite kid focused so again if you don't have kids with you i would also not go, rather i would check out Asterix Park.If you have never been to Disneyland then it is worth the visit but i think there are a lot of other things to do in Paris that are more worth your time.The best part of the day was the Castle Spectacular at the end of the night, very good  but again they have something similar at LA.",0
"We visited Disneyland in December 2017 and had an amazing visit! As we entered the park we were concerned by the huge line to the park and security but the line does move quickly. The security open your bags and go though it with their hands but in the world we now live in, I didn   t mind. The park is everything that you think! It really is like being in another magical world! I would recommend getting the max pass and the Disneyland app. The app has a map of the park and accurate wait times. Part of max pass is that you   re able to use one of many of Disneyland   s professional photographers and down load the photos straight after! You also put a code into your phone and get access to your ride photos. I though this was great! The pass also lets you jump the queue and book in for rides but you can only do this once every 2 hours. Now.... the reason why I deducted two points. I did read on line everywhere that Disneyland was expensive but was still shocked! Just to give you an idea: guided group tour $85, thin Jumper $60, princess mug $25, key ring $10, mouse ears $25, chicken nuggets and chips $10, churros $5, character dining $100 (all prices in USD) this might not sound like much individually but it all ads up! I feel like Disney really takes advantage of guests and tourists. Many blogs and reviews recommends going to the outside restaurants but the park is so huge if you   re hungry, you   re not going to walk 30mins for lunch. The characters were great! All stayed in character and I loved their costumes. The thing Disneyland does best is their attention to detail. From staff uniforms to the rides and park. It   s like being in one of their movies. ",0
"I am a Disneyland lover but the tickets for the park were sold via the hotel we stayed at and at no time from the sale to getting into the gate at the park were we informed that most of rides in a third of the park areas, food carts and stall close at 6pm. The park is advertised as open til 9pm.In addition the parade takes place in total darkness and you can't move around freely for fear of falling in the dark or being robbed. This is a danger for both older and younger people.We did approach the Disneyland staff to complain about the price of the tickets   given they were charged at a full rate  with no after 5pm rate applicable and only portion of the park available to access. So I am not sure I would say rush off to this park if you are in Hing Kong. It's expensive and not nearly as fun as Disneyland Los Angles   Anaheim park.",0
"Ye sit is Disney and it is magic but it is expensive. Restaurants, hotels, food outlets right across the board it is dear. There really isn't a lot of rides attractions for the under 6's. Parade is nice but short and most times you can't get near the characters at the end, the staff are rude and bossy and it is their way or no way. You can get to see Mickey but it is    20, you get a photo for this but big deal, you will have already paid over    60 for a day pass for one.It is well kept, it is cute in size but it is really not worth the effort or expense.",0
"It is a dissapointment this time in HK..minus the ignorance of the mainland China people. I went there before in 2012, service was great when it was still newly opened. Now, attractions would close without notice and it is the most favorite attraction that were closed. It is not recommended to come in July since it's soo HOTTTT. Food and drink are costly. If you buy the souvenir cup, cost HK88, it cost more for the drinks filled up into the cup. Totally not recommended. Disney characters hard to find. Disney MTR was great. No selfie stick sign allowed when you enter the Front Gate but people still use it inside. Go Figure!!",0
"First visit back here in 9 years. Compared to the freshness of DCA, large parts of Disneyland seemed a little tired. Thoroughly enjoyed the evening parade and fireworks, though.",0
"We spent 4 nights 5 days here and had tie to do all that we wanted. There must have been the equivalent of a days rides that were closed for improvement refurbishment. This, coupled with the number of people in the parks, meant that queues were horrendously long. We spent 2 hours in a queue for the Ratatouille ride. Yes, two hours. Most of the rides had a queue time of at least one hour for most of the day. They had sold so many fast passes that some rides were only available to fast pass holders and then they still had to come back at an allocated time. There is no possible way you can get value for money here but if your kids are desperate to do Disney ... then take comfy shoes and endure! Prices everywhere are fixed and expensive. A glass of diet coke was 4.65E. A bottle of wine 24.99E. Everything was a lot more expensive than UK but food quality was good. If you have a restaurant in mind   book it before you go to ensure you get in. Comfy shoes are a must. Although it says no picnics everyone seemed to take in snacks sandwiches for lunch and you weren't challenged. Staff were excellent. Having ticked the box we wouldn't go back.",0
"We took 6 adults and 3 young children as a group booking made direct with eurodisney staying at the Disneyland Hotel at the park entrance.The outward journey was excellent and the proximity of the station to the park and the hotel along with the Disney Express luggage service made for a good start to this short break. When we checked in to the hotel there was much confusion over which adults were in which room with the children and the reception staff seemed to be incapable of sorting it out. As a consequence, we experienced significant problems with allocation of charges to the right room person and had to spend some time at check out on the last day trying to resolve the mis allocation of charges. Whilst the original mistake is possibly understandable, not being able to correct it at check in is not the standard of service we expected from a 5 star hotel   even at Disney! However, the standard of service we received from other staff suggests that this failing was due to a single poor member of the reception staff.It is also not acceptable in a hotel of this standard and price, not too have tea coffee making facilities in the rooms, especially when the minimum charge for room service is 15 euros which makes for a very expensive cuppa! Moreover, when we did resort to room service one evening, the coffee and tea were no better than luke warm and came with no milk at all so were even cooler by the time it finally arrived at our second request. Also, our order for breakfast in our room was lost by the room service waiter and never materialised.Whilst this is a large hotel and breakfast is understandably busy, the dining room staff were friendly and helpful and the buffet breakfast excellent quality, hot and constantly replenished.There was a lack of information on where and when Disney characters would be to meet with children. A daily sheet delivered to each room   a la cruise ship programmes   or at least a daily notice would help parents plan.The Disney Express luggage service was especially useful (and efficient) on the return journey allowing maximum time in the park on the last day. Whilst the train journey was smooth the Eurostar staff were not and the special childrens' meals   goats cheese pasta and sweet potato pure     were not what my 4 year old grandchild eats, and she eats most things! The adult dinner was more of a light snack than a meal   even EasyJet portions are bigger. Given we travelled Standard Premier, this was not in our view acceptable.Overall, a good trip with failings by some staff members and eurostar catering detracting from the experience.",0
Food is teribly expensive and also very big lines you have to stand for atleast 2 hours  for all the rides and stuff and not good value as well,0
We were disappointed in how crowded it was. Touring Plans predicted a 5 out of 10 day. By 1:30pm you could barely walk around the park and ride lines were all at least 1 hour. I would hate to see a 10 day.,0
"If this was your first Disneyland experience, this was ok but not great. For those who are use to American style amusement parks, this would be a bust. You can walk the whole park in about an hour or two and the limited rides were not that exciting as it is here in Calif or Florida.",0
"It had been years since I had been to Disneyland and I was with some friends who have been before as well, so we knew that we needed a plan in order to be bale to hit everything we wanted to. Our focus was on rides, we did not go to any shows or parades. We got there 15 minutes before opening and waited for the gates to open. We went immediately to Indiana Jones and was glad we did that so we only had to wait in line for 20 minutes and the line is generally an hour or more. We were able to hit every ride we wanted between Fast passes and waiting in line. Overall, it was a great experience. I forgot how much fun Disneyland was and also how much patience you need to have since you will be waiting and standing in a LOT of lines. Lines for everything! Cant wait to go again!",0
"Fun, but small compared to parks in Anaheim, Tokyo and, of course, massive Orlando. Getting there is a snap from the mainland.",0
"It is a must have trip if you have kids! Got the kids dressed up in princesses for them to enjoy this magical experience. My child was given a birthday badge by the hotel and she could pin in and get recognised in Disneyland. We have received complimentary ice cream at restuarant and some staff would wish Happy Birthday.However, it is prob my last time gg to Disneyland HK as the 1) Lion King show was the same as 10 yrs ago. 2) experience of being pushed by rude mainland Chinese in queues was not pleasant at all. Perhaps Disneyland SEA in Japan would be a much better choice.",0
"Perhaps it is due to the fact that they have split Disneyland into 2 parks, but Disneyland seemed much smaller than Disneyworld in Orlando or even Eurodisney. Staff was not overly friendly. Just ok.",0
"The kids loved it, I think Disney have every base covered, it's a well oiled machine. Taking as much money as possible from every visitor. Value?The food was much better than I expected, enjoyed the baker on the pier, Your decision really, the queues were so long it was as well we had a two day pass, or we would not have seen every thing. The shows were good especially Aladdin.",0
"This review is from a married couple without kids. Disneyland would be great if it wasn't for all the kids! We bought a condo down the street from Disneyland, so we figured why not get annual passes since we're so close. We ended up going the day we bought the pass, and the day they expired. It was Summer, so that was mistake number 1, but it was just too hard to even walk anywhere without mothers with strollers just stopping in the middle of the walkway without notice, blocking the flow of traffic. This didn't just happen once, but all day long, we got so tired of the crowds that we left after two hours.The emotional trauma we experience in those short two hours kept us from going back all year until I decided we had to go at least one more time to not get totally screwed on the annual pass fee. But it was more of the same and we just stayed a couple hours and have never gone back.I know my brother and his wife and kids just love it, but I think you have to either be young and very tolerant of crowds, or have young kids that love it so you put up with it.Anyways I don't think I will ever go back, unless it's a special occasion where they close down the park for just a small group.",0
"I was in Disneyland for a work conference and went to the park around five. I thought being there in the evening and at night would mean less crowds, but boy was I wrong. The wait times for popular rides were 2 hours! I am guessing in March there were some spring break crowds. I do not recommend going on a weekend in March! It was elbow to elbow crowds. I think too much is packed into a small park. I much prefer Disneyworld where you have some breathing room.",0
"Well I didn't want to compare with any of the American parks but it is difficult not to. It has been a long time since my last visit and it looks like little had been done to change the park in the last twenty years.There were lots of closed rides so it looks like work is underway to improve the park.The characters made it and were as exciting and fun as you would expect with good interaction with children. I have never seen my nieces daughter so excited!Having said that other staff seemed tired and bored with little enthusiasm for what they were doing or the customers. Whilst the enthusiasm of staff in the USA may be false it helps visitors to enjoy the experience.We had taken my mother who is nearly 80 to the park and had wanted to get her a wheelchair, despite arriving early there were none, a surprise when it was so early and was still low season. Despite repeated visits we were unable to obtain a wheelchair during our two days at the park.We had booked a Disney Princess character lunch at Auberge de Cendrillon and staff and characters here were exceptional bringing the needed sparkle to what had been an ok visit. Unfortunately my mother was taken ill and two members of staff helped her and provided support over and above what I would have hoped for. They were great and were of comfort to her. Thank you.I think my rating is fair and in parts I would say the park is good in parts but needs work!",0
"Our 3rd family visit over a four day period and it was markedly busier than the same time in previous years. Although I expect queues on two if the four days the park seemed at bursting point and I wondered if the 20th anniversary offers had been too successful. The fast pass got us on one ride per day only, the remainder had over one hour queues so averaged around four a day of any note so this made poor value. There were less characters accessible to the children and fewer small accessible shows. Smoking by adults around children was common place and toilet waiting time for the girls was up to 30 minutes and long waits for drinks. I have had good times at Disney and the girls still speak favourably although even they reached the point of asking to go home. I do think Disney need to look at the place through the eyes of families and aim to improve. It will be a long time before I go near a Disney again.",0
Everyone seems so cranky. With so many things being closed its hard to keep guests happey and keep cast members happier,0
It's was nice! There needs to be more investment into the park and the service it's self. Everything is still done in paper unlike Disney World.  We also didn't see not one character it was very disappointing for my daughter,0
"Its my first Disney park visit so was excited, but didn't find much adult rides and activities.Best place to visit with kids off course but do carry umbrella(in my thinking )on sunny days because it's too hot. And be ready for long walks :)And I found more shopping Disney shops then rides.Well connected with metro tube but less options for taxi to return.",0
"We traveled to Disneyland during the Thanksgiving break. Both parks, Disneyland and California Adventure, were packed. We did get some fast passes but even with that we wasted all our time waiting in line. The parks were decorated with Christmas themes which was very special. I will make it a point not to visit at this time again!",0
We booked via Klook and got straight to the entry. Unfortunately the queues inside were loong. 40 min queue for a 3 minute ride. Get the express pass if you really want to enjoy the experience especially with young ones. My 4 year old could only recognize Woody & gang and Miles from Tomorrowland as he's seen it on TV. Of course Mickey & gang too. He didn't really get what's the hype all about (what disney princess? what dumbo? :)) . Parade was great and all the performers really kept their showmanship up for the entire show   good job! Night show supposedly great but we never made it that far... :(,0
"For those who love the magic of Disney, this park is a lot of fun. From the moment you step onto the Disney train line, there is no mistaking where you're going.  The park itself is like a mini version of its American counterparts. It...More",0
"Disneyland, is of course a must see when in the US. For my family personally, it didn't live up to all the fairy dust and sparkles. The lines were extremely long and the wait times for most of the rides and attractions were over an hour. This part of the experience was disappointing and the cost was very expensive. The up side to Disneyland was the fireworks at the end of the day (9:20pm) were spectacular to say the least. They were an incredible spectacle for all ages. If you are planning trip to Disneyland, save up for it and be prepared to wait.",0
"my biggest issue with the park is the food, very expensive and it isn't even good food.  They should limit the number strollers, wow double wides should not be allowed!",0
"Magic kingdom is good, but the queues are huge. I've been lucky enough to go to Florida and I must say it wipes the floor with Paris. The charm and magic just weren't there. Even the kids said so. We did just one day there and didn't manage to do everything, but we didn't expect too. The parade was good, but there weren't many characters around and only a couple of greeting spots. The princess Pavillion was a joke. It closes at 3:30pm and only has 1 2 Princesses there at most. It's Disney for god's sake. Princesses are what people come for. The light show too at the end was good, but a little overly CGI for my taste and not done with the attention to detail i'd expect from Disney. HyperSpace Mountain is essential the same roller coast with a couple of tie Fighters and lights strung up inside it and nothing to write home about. Needs doing properly to be a good Star Wars ride. Star Tours is excellent though so do that if you go. Thunder Mountain is also very good and very fast. We did it at the end of the day and im not sure whether it was the dark, but it was great,To sum up i'd save up and go to Florida as it lacked the magic in Paris.",0
Staff needs to be trained and adhere to the standard procedure to deal with tourists who push in instead of keep serving whoever is good at pushing in or pretend they can't see it happening.,0
Difficulty walking through the park due to large crowds and long wait times for most rides spoilt what may have been a good day. I have experienced better times at the other Disney parks. Fastpass not the easiest to use here.,0
"Comparing to Disneyland LA, it is very much different. It's mostly kiddy rides but it is always a happy feeling when visiting any Disneyland. This time I could go on some rides more often as it didn't seem to get much crowded. Same shops as the US, so you can get good souvenirs too. Very convenient transport as well with the MTR.",0
"I love Disney. But French staff rude and very slow. Attractions either for very young children or teens. Nothing in between and attraction time very short, less than 2 min.!Missing some American professionalism instead of French amateurs....Biggest highlight is the Disney Dreams show at the closing time of the park, it is fantastic.Extra Magic Hours (park open 8 10 am for hotel guests) is a great idea, but many attractions don't open before 10 am, WHY?",0
"Having stepped across from the awesome Walt Disney studios we were really disappointed! Loads of the rides were shut (I assume they do a lot of repair work before the summer) so it really wasn't all that.On the plus side, we didn't queue for longer than 10 minutes per ride and space mountain is wicked!Definitely recommend spending most of your day in Walt Disney studios and hopping across once you're finished.",0
"Smaller than Florida's, but we were only there to kill time before a flight home",0
we picked the wrong day to go there and therefore i have given the rating as average.having said that its great to see where it all started and is great for the little ones.It was so packed as it was hottest day in january.all the locals said they have never seen it so packed.there should be a restriction on how many visitors are let in they allow in and we only managed to get round to 4 rides as the lines were never ending.If you can afford it get one of those things that let you come back at a certain time.saddly we didnt.,0
"We are Disneyland fans and go often. I would say in all our years of going to Disneyland, this time was the most crowded. We pretty much just go for the Christmas ambiance. The ride waits were excessive. Biggest disappointment was not getting the grandkids in to see Santa  3 hour wait  yikes! Never had to wait more than about half hour before. ",0
"This was my second time going here, the first was the end of September when it wasn't too warm and very little queues. August and the amount of people was huge, obviously with school holidays in europe and america etc. The first ride we went to we queued for 1 hr and 20 mins. The lines are built deceptively that from the outside it does not look long but then you turn a corner and it goes on forever. It was my partners first timer here but due to the crowds we didnt get to see or do a lot of the rides during the 1 day pass. We missed the parade and due to having to return to Paris at 8:30, we did not get to see the light show at night. I had a better experience during off peak times (when kids are at school) and got to see and do so much more.",0
"Very busy, enjoyable but not as good as USA Disneyland. If you are intending to buy souvenirs, don't wait until the end of the day, it gets too crowded and you won't be able to browse. Food lines take up to over 2 hours wait so go early to line up.",0
"Very average. Way to busy, people are pushy, it's over crowded and just really unenjoyable. I strongly suggest you give this a miss and go to ocean park instead.",0
On holiday with my husband and 9 yr old daughter. As always Disneyland is truly magical place. Our daughter was so excited to be there after her months of great anticipation. We visited Orlando years ago whilst our children were younger and didn't know how Paris would compare. We were not disappointed ! The magic is present as soon as you arrive and once again you are fully immersed in the Disney wonderland.We were however let down by the fact so many of the rides are closed at present. Why are they closed for servicing during peak holiday season when they could do this at any time of the year. My daughter was disappointed that many of the rides she wanted to visit were closed. Nothing like a child's disappointment to burst the bubble of imagination! Poor show Disney! ,0
"Great park, smaller scale, very cute. We went first week of December, really short wait times for rides which was a bonus. Didn't use fast pass at all in this park. However, not quite as pristine as other Disney parks. Having had annual passes for Tokyo Disney, HKG just doesn't stand up. While both are crowded, busy parks, the cultural differences between the two show in ways such as staff and guest attitude. The Japanese are polite, clean and meticulous is all I will say.",0
"Dislikes:  Loooooong lines (45 minutes to 2 hours EACH).  Too many rides breaking down.  Likes:  Fun rides, nice landscaping, clean grounds and very friendly staff.",0
We went in April 2012 just before the start of the 20 year anniversary. A great place for kids and adults alike.One ride called Big Thunder Mountain we all looked forward to riding was closed for maintenance but the day it was ready to ride it was still faulty.Everything is overpriced but then it is usually a one in a lifetime visit. Long queues but make use of rides that offer FastPass . Great idea that.,0
"In order to enjoy Disney you have to find your 'inner child'. We did and had a great time. This is our family's second visit to Paris Disneyland and we think it is a good choice. The Dreams show is worth staying for. The reason I only give it 3 stars? Lots of rides were closed, it is VERY expensive, and the standards in the toilets are poor. Detailing of the theming is great and even better...when we went in late September...hardly any queues!",0
"The Happiest place on earth unless you are a young child wanting to gain the full experience. Whilst it was spring break and it was stupidly busy, it is hard to see yet understand how adults can feel comfortable in pushing in front of children or adult couples line up on a children's ride and make the kids have to wait even longer. For example pairs of adults waiting for ages for the storybook land ride. There is no way that unless you have kids that you would want to go onto this ride yet they did which only extended the line. The FastPass system is now outdated and abused and does not offer any advantage to those who buy passes allowing it. Most fast passes were sold out earlier in the day. Although it was spring break and Easter which are rather busy times there were a heap of rides shut down which was not right. CarsLand is a awesome but it was extraordinary to see the line everyday for the FastPass for cars ride went almost back to the front gate.The line for the ride was always 120mins or more so unless you got there first thing and even then waited for 50mins there was no way you would wait and ride again later on. It was hard to see as a parent your children have to wait in lines that went well over 40mins for one of the simpler rides. The park itself was great and they enjoyed it but it seems to have lost its way. It's not as magical for children who can only ride a handful of rides due to the crowds or lack of fast passes. Look everyone with kids must do it but it's best to try and go on the quieter times of the year otherwise especially if you travel internationally it's not worth if. My wife who is a big Disneyland fan walked away disappointed and disheartened. As it was my chores first time they were impressed but exhausted as we had to spend all of each of the 5 days ate the park running around due to lines been so long and crowds so big. ",0
I visited this park in the 1960's and took my daughter here in the spring for 2 days. We had a really good time. There were a few rides shut down and we were a bit disappointed but we didn't let it deter us from enjoying our visit. I scouted the internet for discounted park tickets and found none. Don't waste your time. Fairly pricey. Souvenirs were pricey as well as food. We opened and closed the park. The firework show is good but since I produce fireworks shows my daughter and I took advantage of that time to get on popular rides fast. I'd suggest doing this if you only have a day or two to visit the park.  The Disney parade is very entertaining even for a fifty year old. I'll never forget the look on my 13 year old daughters face during the parade. She was a little girl all over again which was worth the price of admission. All in all the two of us had a great time. We liked California Adventure better though.,0
"After visiting the Disney World resort in Orlando last year, I was quite disappointed by the level of customer service offered at the Paris resort. First of all there was no free wi fi on offer in the main parks. All the parks including the water parks of the Orlando Resort offered DisneyGuest wi fi. As a guest, you were encouraged to download a Disneyland app, but this wasn't possible without either being a French resident or buying overseas roaming data from your mobile provider. Secondly, I was disappointed by the long queue time for meeting a Disney princess. In Orlando, you were able to meet three at once by joining a much shorter queue that did not require a reservation pass which you also had to queue for in the Paris resort. And finally, after checking out of Davy Crockett Ranch, we were hoping to use the pool one last time before catching the ferry back to the UK. However, we were told that this was not allowed as we had already checked out. I'm places such as Centre Parcs, you are able to use the pool facilities for a few hours after checking out of your accommodation.",0
"Visited eurodisney with a 4 year old and 1 year old, first time at a Disney park. Not massively impressed and I think peppa pig world was better to be honest, in terms of rides and quality, for a 4 yr old anyway, perhaps not fair comment for older children,First day in fantasyland, there was quite a bit closed but we took our 4 year old on the pincoccjio 'ride' which is a stilted ghost train type which she was a bit scared of, it's quite a dark story, then the Peter pan ride which through the eyes of a 34 yr old seemed a bit old, 4 yr old liked it though. We fast tracked that one which means you book ahead scanning your park ticket then come back at a designated time, that was a v good idea. Dumbo ride was ok on a par with peppa pig balloon rides, over pretty quickly. The main thing about Disney is the shops, a massive proportion is shops of Disney merchandise, nice quality clothes and hats, cuddley toys etc. we made the mistake of going to a burger place for lunch which was ok not greAt, 35 euro for 2 adults and 1 child so not ok ish price, second day we did baguettes which were much better in the studios, we had snack vouchers for 3 6pm but the designated places had massive queues so we didn't use vouchers, frozen sing along was v good and we were lucky to get in. The parade however was very good and not seeing many of the characters during the 2 days it was good to see them all, worth hanging around for. Buffet restaurants in the park are genuinely good with nice food choices so if you have vouchers it's good to go to these. Only regret we didn't go on Nemo ride as it looked good but 4 yr old too small... All in all glad we went but won't be hurrying back ",0
"My husband's first Disneyland experience; I've been to the one in LA. This is not a patch on the US destination which really is where dreams come true. Poor weather   well, you've got to expect that in late September in France   didn't phase us. But lousy customer service really isn't what the Disneyland brand represents. And we experienced disinterested, laissez faire, really couldn't give a toss, 'service' from the start. No boring details necessary, just don't expect the enthusiastic welcome of an American park, where everyone employed there seems to want to be employed there.In terms of the park itself, I'd recommend focusing on Disneyland Park rather than Walt Disney Studios, but only because of the wonderful detail and full experience that the Park provides. When you enter Disneyland (which opens at 10am and the queues only get longer from then on), you enter Disney's dreamland. Each 'world' segues seamlessly with the next and is notable for its amazing attention to detail.Best advice is to get to grips with the FastPass system. If a ride you want to visit has a long queuing time, you can swipe your card at the FastPass reader (if the ride has a FP system) and be issued with an advance booking ticket. This usually lets you come back to the ride in an hour or so's time and gain entry via a special entrance; much shorter waiting time. But not all rides have a FP system and even those that do aren't always working.We stayed at Radisson Blu, a golf resort outside the village. It's got a free shuttle bus every half hour and was a great hotel for adults (not for kids really). If our budget had stretched to it I would have considered staying at one of the on site hotels; they sometimes offer early entry (an extra two hours' worth of visiting) as well as no travelling time.Despite queuing for several hours over the course of the day, we did and saw everything we had intended. Returning the following day for Walt Disney Studios was something of a disappointment   the only highlight here was the engaging movie experience 'Cinemagique'.All in all an extremely expensive visit that won't be repeated, in Europe anyway.",0
We went early in the morning however it was probably the worst time to go. I would recommend going in the afternoon and if you   re ok to skip the parade then that   s the best time to go on the rides as there is little or no lines! Going in summer with kids is challenging but no matter they still enjoy it and it   s worth it for the young kids. ,0
"In essence, if you come after 11 am, you will only find a huge ultra loud Disney Hollywood themed upsell heaven, a huge outdoor mall with expensive toys and food, and occasional rides with 45 90 minute wait times. You will also find that some attractions with long queues are just walk through  art  displays or talking cartoon characters   a ridiculous waste of time, if you ask me. So, if it's rides you're after, the main thing is to come early, just when the doors open at 9:30. You will then enjoy all the rides within some 90 minutes and then spend the rest of your time as you please. If you can't, do buy the fast pass, you'll be helpless and very dissatisfied without it. Another worthy option is to book a stay at one of the three hotels around the park: they offer an extra admission hour from 8:30 to 9:30 in the morning plus 1 fast pass on any ride for all guests, and that helps a lot. You don't have to book direct or at HK DL site, booking.com and other aggregators may offer better deals.Prices are another pain point. Dining is quite expensive, either in the park or in hotels. You do want to consider the dining coupons offered on HK DL website, as well as ticket hotel combos and other offers; they make sense. The offers and prices there and at klook.com are the cheapest (and identical), but at Klook you can collect points and save at other HK attractions (you can save 25 HKD off your first order with code WK7A9 then explore more coupons at picodi.com). Alternatively, do bring your own snacks and drinks.If you can still feel your feet at the end of your DL experience, exit the park and walk right of the whale sculpture. You'll enjoy a beautiful and almost empty (yet also plagued with loud music) passage to the pier and hotel gardens, and a great seaside view. First hotel to your right has a great bush maze, children love it. Afterwards you can exit through the hotel and take a free shuttle bus to the train station.",0
"We went to Disneyland Paris while we were on our honeymoon in France. It was definitely a trip to remember however, Disneyland was not as expected. Unfortunately, the park was a lot smaller than we had expected   even including, Walt Disney Studios. There are not many rides to begin with so when 15 rides were down by 6pm, we were very upset. We still made the best of it and the firework  light show on Sleeping Beauty   s castle is something we   ll never forget! Just wish we either had more time or their wasn   t an electrical outage! ",0
"I've never been to other Disneylands... but according to everybody.. HK Disney is the smallest among all. Well, you can see everything in one day, but I truely enjoyed my time there. I loved riding Space mountain and watching old Mickey movie...",0
"I would of given this lower review, had it not been for the following:Been to Disney Florida twice before as a child and absolutely loved it, so was really excited to be going Disneyland as an adult. I was really excited and kept telling my friend (who I went with and has never been before in his life) that space mountain is amazing etc etc.We paid for the Hopper Pass (and glad we did) and asked people where Space Mountain is, to find it was closed and to come back 'tomorrow'. Nobody had mentioned it was closed, not even the staff members in the park, or the front desk, so I was really annoyed. How can they charge full price $155 so not exactly cheap, and one of the best rides is closed, so we complained. I cannot remember what this lady's name is but again she said to come tomorrow. I explained we was travelling around and we're leaving LA tomorrow, so how can we? She then gave us some fast track passes to 3 rides, one of them being the Cars ride. We accepted this, as this is better than nothing, and glad we did as even mid week, this was busy, and the Cars ride had 65 minute waiting time, but we skipped all of that. Glad we had Hopper passes as most the best rides are in the California Adventure Park (sadly there is no Rock N Roll coaster in the LA one, so that was a disappointment) The California Screamin' and The Ferris Wheel (where the carriages rock) were by far the best rides there. Had such a blast in this park.I have noticed that Disney like every other park is just a money making pit. Expensive parking, pay for the shows, fast track, downtown Disney is expensive. Overall I had a better time at the other theme parks. I would recommend to just go to Adventure park only, as the other park was just a huge disappointment and the rides are not exactly that good. We didn't even see any parades, and the only show was the lights show in the evening, but again you have to pay to get best views, so we did not bother and went back to our hotel.",0
Went to Disneyland HK with my son and mum in August. There was a lot of people and the weather is very hot.The queues to all rides were at least 20 mins. As the weather is very hot there were some areas in the park that had a lacking of trees   shade which made it tough to stay there for long. Example the toystoryland There was no proper sitting area to watch the fireworks at night so most people especially the ones in front had to sit on the road which was scorching hot from the sun earlier in the day. It was still radiating of heat at nightQuality of food was not great that the theme park especially those covered by the hotel park package. The Dim sums at Plaza Inn near the main street was good. The wanton noodles at Chopin food festival was bad. Photo plus option for tourists was really good to allow visitors to download professional photos with the characters later at their own time.Toilets were surprisingly clean which I was very happy with.Overall it might be the weather that spoilt it for me but I wasn't overly impressed with the HK Disneyland. ,0
"On the whole I felt a little disappointed if I'm honest... We have a 6 year old boy and we had been building up to this trip for months, and i just didn't feel like there was the  Disney Magic  that I expected... When we arrived at our accommodation (Davy Crockett's Ranch) we had to drive through a building site...When we got into Disney a few of the rides were closed which was annoying but on the whole it just seemed like any other theme park appart from all the Disney fairy type stuff, which just didn't interest my lad at all! Most of the Disney staff were really nice however we found that other staff (such as restaurant staff etc) we rather rude and ignorant.On the plus side, they had a Star Wars Jedi Training Academy which was absolutely brilliant, My son is a big Star Wars fan and for him to become a Jedi Padawan was absolutely priceless.On the whole I wouldn't discourage anyone from going as I'm sure every family will have there own experience, but we wont be rushing back any time soon.One last point, take some good walking shoes... You will walk miles!",0
"I have an experience with many disneyland but this time, Hong Kong Disneyland did not meet my expectation. The park crew is not smile, warm welcome and always busy. Actually I love to learn service behavior from disneyland crew, so this time, they show the quality of service was down. Personally, I think Everland Korea is better than HK disneyland",0
"when I say speechless I'm not sure whether I mean it in a positive or negative way!! The whole park was extremely crowded, and some people were very rude, pushing past me and my family, when there was clearly no room to pass. In the restaurant there was no where to sit and to queuing to get food took at least an hour, plus the food sizes where small and at a high price. Don't go on the peter pan ride, its a waste of time!!! On the other hand I still enjoyed going to disney land because I saw the castle and explored the wondrous park.",0
"My wife, my 2 year old and of course me had a nice few days here. We stayed in a Disney hotel which was nice and easy for access to the park.The park itself is fine. good for the wee ones. There was a few things closed but didn't really bother us too much as these were things our son couldn't go on. my son appeared to enjoy it, nice bright and fun place for him too be. The parade was fun to watch and the illuminations were amazing. Point of note, try and get a close standing point for the illuminations for best experience. There was a few rides for the wee man, tea cups he loved, the kids roller coater and the buzz lightyear ride were his favorites. Ok the other side of Disney from an adult. Right if you plan to go use your noggin and go on a week day away from the holiday season. If you can that is. cues are just insane sometime and at the weekend there is no point as you waste 1 2 your day for 1 ride. Check what rides are on and off as there is only a couple rides for adults really and if there are off its an expensive walk around a park. If you plan to eat, make a reservation is a must for a restaurant other than that there is some wee vendors or a cafe's. Be prepared to spend a fortune. Yes it's a Disney Park, yes expect it to be expensive but I was shocked as to how bad it actually is. They have you over a barrel though unless you bring your own. Just how it goes really. If you have little ones and staying at a Disney hotel you get a couple extra magic hours. if youre thinking yeah this mean I can skip cues and ride on the big people rides then think again. don't waste your time. It's not worth it. Only rides that are open are kids ones and it's just as busy as normal. As a personal experience to be honest it's an ok place to go. It's fine for a day or 2 but it somehow actually lacks the Disney feeling that you get in other parks. We shall not go back as it's just lacking in all aspects for us ",0
"340 Dollars for a one day visit, one park, 2 adults, 1 child. Hours in line to get in, hours in line to get on any attractions, hours in line for an hot dog, everything is just overpriced.. All I take back home from this visit is NEVER GO BACK.",0
"Good time, but be careful of Nut Allergy. Signs are posted that say they will work with your allergy, however, when we tried to order pizza they told us there were no nuts in it, but when we saw it had pesto on it knew for certain had nuts. We spoke with the whole staff (including the chef) in a particular area and they said it did not have nuts, but the staff in an adjacent area (with the same product) said the item most certainly had nuts. The item was pesto and had pine nuts in it. Fortunately, we knew it did and did not consume it, but for those that don't know it can mean life and death. Very disappointing, especially because they were so adamant that it did not have any nuts. I did speak to a manager in Guest Services, but I don't know how far that went. Just be aware. Other than that, it was a good time.",0
"I really wish I could write a magical review but sadly that's not the case. Myself, misses and our 2yr old went for a weekend trip to gently break little Eliie into the Disney bubble, before heading across the pond to the USA. Both myself and wife had been before many yrs ago separately and sort of knew what we had in store, as we have also been to the USA versions. It was a Christmas spectacle weekend but sadly they forgot to send that memo to all the staff and park designers, with just the first arch and Main Street decorated and no sound of any Xmas music to be heard, in fact there was no music to be heard anywhere!!!! Not even the constant loop of  SMALL WORLD . The park was packed with visitors but not a Disney caractor in sight!! Except for designated times in designated areas with a now got use to 2hr Queue, the only way we felt we could get to meet them was to book a breakfast meet and greet... Which brings me nicely to food... OUCHHHHHHH super expensive and at best just ok, snack wise McDonalds was a big mistake, over populated, rude shatter staff, no order, no seats, when you finally did find somewhere to sit, other customers would try to nearly sit on your lap or push you along your table to make space for them!!!! If you did get what you ordered you were lucky and if not the thought of fighting your way back to the counter would bring you out in a cold sweat. Most of the park restaurants where closed, and the ones that weren't were v expensive (   30 per head) packed or very child UN friendly. As a family with a child it seemed strangely unwelcoming and we felt our only option was to wonder around all day every day, as you couldn't get onto the rides without an  hr wait, and without the buggy (as there not to be taken past ride gates) and either a shattered or active toddler is not fun.. The one saving grace is the dream castle show and fireworks which is stunning.. But why ohh why do it at 22:00???? Leaving literally thousands off ppl all leaving at the same time racing for the busses. It could easily be done at 8 or 9 for the same effect and allow ppl time to wonder more and slowly make there way home. Also again most kids are by now shattered or asleep and miss it all. I really don't want to put a downer on it the park as other family's with older kids may have a blast but I do believe it's lost its sparkle and get the feeling that most staff hope it's there last day. So   very expensive, over priced poor relation to the USA parks where I get the feeling that even Disney have given up on the park... Sorry",0
If you don't like French rudeness then don't go here.  You are much better off saving up and going to Florida where the staff are properly trained and actually like their guests.  Most of the staff here felt like they were doing us a favour!,0
Disney World is much better and bigger for the money.  Disneyland seemed a little outdated.  It was the first time I had been there in 48 years and it didn't look like much had changed.,0
"But, it was better in 1955, they try hard to keep it relevant, maybe too hard",0
"Disneyland is still great fun. It's great how they've kept the rides up to date over the years and the old favorites are still there. I still love to wander along Main Street USA in all the shops. But it's not just the admission that's outrageous, it's the cost of everything right down to a bottle of water. I'm surprised it doesn't cost a dollar to get into the bathroom (oops, I shouldn't give them any ideas!). I don't know how often I'll ever go again at this rate. I don't know how so many families with kids can afford it anymore",0
"The park really should have a Will Call line to pick up tickets. Instead, I had to wait nearly an hour in line with people who didn't know what they want. My two minute transaction should have taken just that long: two minutes. Instead, I wasted precious time in line, and there's just no reason for it. As a 'process person', this kind of thing drives me crazy.",0
"Its Disneyland, great for the kids. Try taking the special disneyland train. If you are driving taxi expect a long walk from the car park. THere's very little shade along the way, so on hot days, either avoid, or bring an umbrella. We were there on a particularly hot summer day, and could only stand it for about 45 minutes. Ideal times to visit are in the cooler but still sunny weather, between October and December.Worth a visit and a stay is the Disneyland Hotel.. over priced for what it is, but quite unique. While on Lantau Island, take a short trip to Discovery Bay, a place where many ex pats like to call home. ITs a car free area, so the only way to get there is by ferry or bus. One of its unique features is that only golf biggies are allowed to be driven there. ITs also a good place for parents to relax and have a drink or meal and watch the fireworks from Disneyland at 8pm.",0
"Had a 2 day  2 park ticket and spent one full day in each park with 3 kids, considering the amount of hours we spent in each park (12hours each) there were hardly any characters wondering about, and if we did manage to see one it was mayhem!! Adults who had no kids were outrageously pushing and shoving through children in order to take their picture leaving young children sad because they could not get through these adults.... Smoking is a issue as you had people smoking in the cues with their smoke blowing in children's faces and workers didn't seem to mind, so if you go with children be prepared for this!.... The Women's toilets in both parks (almost every single one) was filthy!! poo in toilets, blood stained tissues left on floors, hairballs and dirt in the hand dryers.... Many Rides kept breaking down and had to be shut for testing, and the rides that were working displayed inaccurate waiting times (if it stated a waiting time of 20mins, Expect to be there for 65mins) while i understand that a lot of people visit the parks so there is bound to be cues, i just feel that in order to stop children and families becoming frustrated in cues they should be a bit more honest with times. With that said... the rides and attractions were Great!! everything is said in French however they do repeat in English which was very handy...All staff speak french but are able to understand English so communication is not a problem. Staff were friendly and happy to help, but be advised the general french Spanish public were Rude and Arrogant!! for some reason they expect their child to go first and are happy to swear at you if they don't, (so expect a lot of parents pushing their child in front of yours)... there are a good amount of places to eat in both parks but is very expensive with a burger, chips & drink costing 15Euros! on site is a place called  Disney Village  home of further expensive food halls and restaurants, However there is a MC DONALDS hidden in the back out of sight which will save you lots (Disney do not advertise this as being in the park). the 20th anniversary parade was good as the children were able to get a glimpse of a handful of characters driving on the floats.. but be warned... arrive at the parade at least 40mins early in order to get a good spot for your child as once again you have Adults pushing their way by themselves pass children in order to get to the front leaving young children faced with nothing but the view of a Backside in front of them (which was quite sad to see as for some of these children this is a once in a life time trip). DO NOT MISS the 23:00 castle show as this is phenomenal and has to be witnessed by all, as i can appreciate this seems late for young children but it will be the highlight of their trip by far!!!",0
"We took the RER to from Disneyland Paris as it seemed to be the most efficient mode of transportation. As a huge Disneyland California fan, I was pretty excited to spend the day here, but sadly, it did not live up to my expectations. Very few rides offered the Fast Pass option & most (if not all) had distributed its entire days    worth of passes by noon     We arrived at the park as it was opening & were only able to snag 2 or 3. Another huge disappointment was the fact that there were no churros. (I thought $6 churros were a Disneyland staple?!) We couldn   t even find any fancy candied apples or pastries as a substitute. Aside from a majority of the employees being noticeably unfriendly unhappy, the restrooms & overall cleanliness of the park were not up to standard. I did however enjoy seeing the similarities & differences between the Paris versions of Indiana Jones, Pirates of the Caribbean, etc. compared to the California versions. Towards the end of the night, we ventured over to Walt Disney Studios, but were only able to ride a few attractions as the lines were still pretty long. All in all, our Disneyland Paris experience was mediocre at best     The    magical    vibe I expect from Disney Parks just wasn   t there.",0
"I love Disney parks, I have been in 4 already and I have to say this one was really disappointing, it is very small and all the attractions are for kids, I tried all the  fast  roller coasters and I didn't like them. I went on a Friday and it was pretty empty so it was easy to go to the attractions, without the lines. The parade was very good as in every Disney park. And the area of pandora is like being in the princess movie, I really recommend it. I really like the metro station that you can take to get into the park, it is very cheap and comfortable. (Pink line) ",0
This is a great park and some rides are better than Florida but it is let down by disorganisation. Rides continually break down and are not repaired. Shortage of staff to organise the getting on and off the rides resulting in long queues. Toilets not checked or cleaned on a regular basis. Security wait on entry is long and badly organised resulting in people pushing and tempers fraying.  Food in the park is expensive. Buy drinks at the shop at the train station much cheaper.  Parade was excellent as was the evening firework show. Need to learn from Florida about organisation and customer service,0
Disneylands the world over are generic apart from the language. This was no different than the others. It was a shame about all the building work and some closed eating areas.  Definitely worth a visit if you have young children.,0
If you want to go to the most small Disneyland you need to go to Hong Kong. Few years ago i go with my daughter to Paris and in november 2010 to Hong Kong. It's really like the attraction in Disney It's a small world. ............... It's in my opiniun not a real Disneyland.,0
"We visited over the weekend which was a mistake. The queues for the rides were horrendous eg. one hour for a ride that literally lasted 1 minute! and on Sunday, many of the attractions were simply not available. The choice of food was very poor and expensive. Restaurant food was up to 70 Euros for steak and chips. 3 Euros for a bag of crisps or a soft drink.Toilet facilities were good but finding somewhere to sit was not easy; they need more places to rest tired feet.Taking children that will not remember the experience is, in my opinion, a complete waste of time and money.The hotel Explorer near the site was clean and tidy with a free bus service to the site every ten minutes. Breakfast was okay with cereals, cheese, yogurt, fruit etc but scrambled eggs and bacon were 4 Euros extra.We took a taxi from the airport (CDG) and that cost 86 Euros per trip.",0
"Due to it's being off season, 3 or more big attractions were closed. And that is why we had waited so for many long lines for the ones that were available. It was so cold and it was dreadful. I mean waiting lines were for at least for 30 minutes to 80 minutes and the rides for were 40 seconds. But yeah it's disnet. What can you do? Bring food with you!",0
"Personally I prefer this to the Studios, when we went there were lots of reforms going on. Bit of a let down although we did know about them before we went. Check whats being updated as that will alter your experience. The Pirates ride broke when we were on and they had to turn the lights on, spoilt the experience. Staff all ran round like headless chickens,,,was quite funny! Staff lack the Disney Magic so make your own. Food expensive and a lot of people take their own baguettes. ",0
"Not a true disney exoerience; it's like a classic franchise concept... doesn't have the same charm or depth as the US or Japanese Disney's and having done them all, definitely the lowest from a thrilling day out standpoint. Expensive day out and can get very busy. ",0
"There were just so many people. The first part of the day was fine. Parade was nice. There are some interactive parts of the parade when the performers will invite little kids to play. The queues were bearable except some which you may have to wait 45 minsThe tram that goes around disney is usually two way. So we parked the stroller at Fantasy land. Only when we were queuing then they made the announcement that all passengers have to alight at the main station which means we have to walk all the way back to get our stroller. Prepare you video cameras cos right after fantasy land, into tomorrowland, There will be little monsters greeting the passengers. Hahahaha!!!Food and drinks are expensive but it should not be a surprise. Themed parks are all like that. But the food options are really quite limited. dragged her daughter and right past everyone to stand in front for Elsa photo taking. Even after they told her nicely, she became fierce. Most are ok but you have to stand firm and tell them to please not jump q. Some will just ignore you. HahahaThe crowd. The crowd! Where do I start? Where do these people come from. All of a sudden, just before the night parade, throngs of people started appearing from everywhere. It was so crowded, it was impossible to walk. Right after the parade, everyone rushed to the shops. It was IMPOSSIBLE to walk. The people jumped over our stroller, stepped on our feet, without any apologies, like that was the way to go. The park guests were so rude and horrid. They cough into your face and do not queue. Earlier in the day, one Mainland chinese mother,blatantly ignored everyone in the q, she walked past everyone and stood right in front of the queue. When told that she has to q, she became fierce and ignored the comments. How scary...If you are staying at the Disney Hotels, there are frequent bus shuttle services that will bring you to Disneyland but its still a good ten min walk away. If you are travelling with kids, better bring whatever they need. For those who do not wish to pay the entrance fees and still would like to catch the fireworks, feel free to wait at the entrance. There is a nice fountain where you can take pics while waiting for the fireworks to start.Go there knowing that you will have to brave the crowd, you will have fun and survive. Overall, its still a fun place to go",0
not one of the best Disney's i have been to but i still enjoyed it and there was no more than a five min wait to get on the rides,0
"Nice park, but not nearly as nice as Disney world.  Enjoyed the days spent there.  Tourists and long lines.  Not pocketbook friendly.  A disappointment.",0
Queues were short but most restaurants were closed so ended up leaving to eat in the Village. The toilets just inside the park were all filthy when we arrived,0
"Ok so they can   t help the heat, but this was my first Disney experience, and for the price you pay to get in (not to mention the buffet at nearly   47 per person) I felt a little cheated. Bar one parade the only characters I actually saw were chip and dale (rescue rangers). Maybe Micky was too busy counting all his money to pop down to see us.... I also question their car number plates.",0
"We went as a family of 4 with a 2 days pass, the kids loved it but unfortunately long queue for all rides and flocked by mainlanders. Generally small compared to Disneyland US or Japan. If you need stroller, they do hire for day rate @ 90HKD with 100HKD refundable deposit. Park cleanliness is well maintained but toilet can be on the down side due to high traffic. Will probably revisit when kids are older and hopefully they will be more attractions.",0
"We were visiting family in Germany and my husband surprised me and our son (6 yrs.) with a 4 days trip to Disneyland Paris. We were very excited as we are big Disney fans.This was our first time ever staying at a Disney Resort Hotel  a good experience.We stayed at the Sequioa Lodge which was perfect for us. (Great staff and location!)What was not so good? Simply put, the  Magic  seemed missing. The rides were fantastic (Get Fast Passes when possible), but the pushing and shoving is what got me. Forget about the idea of making a proper line to get an autograph and picture with a character. Parents shove their kids to the front and they follow. (lines for characters in the hotels and for Sully   Buzz DID have proper lines!) Get used to fighting your way through. Smoking   there are  smoking areas , but NO ONE cares. People light up all over the place and no  cast member  ever says anything. The Dollar   Euro exchange rate is not good, so that is why everything was SO expensive in our eyes. All that was done was take the dollar price and put a Euro symbol in front of it, e.g. $14.95 for a Jedi Mickey in Florida cost 14.95 Euros (about $22.00)But again, the  magic  was missing   the pride in keeping things up, the friendly faces   not there.Am I glad we went? Yes. Will I ever really want to go back? No. If you have the chance, save up and experience Florida.",0
Was a lovely day but traveling from Australia to see this place for the first time there was a lot of things closed for renovations. Lines were bad and this was meant to be the quiet time. Only found out about fastpass when leaving. If going for the first time research this before you go it is free and saves time in lines. Not many characters out and about either. ,0
"Don't get me wrong we had a great weekend celebrating our daughters 5th birthday and with our little 17 month old daughter to. We stayed at the Disneyland New York hotel which is an ideal location, a 5 minute walk into the first part of the Disney village which is some shops and restaurants then a further 5 10 minute walk to the entrance of both Disneyland or Walt Disney Studios.Disneyland is great for kids, it had quite a few rides suitable for a 5 year old who's a little bit scared. We did the rockets near space mountain which were fun as you can move them up and down yourself. We also did the tea cups that spin round and the Peter Pan adventure with all 4 of us, which was great. The other rides bar some are a bit to fast for little folk, unless they're super brave and up for it! My only real problem were the queues, it was a freezing cold January weekend, although the sun was shining, we had huge queues for everything. This makes it hard to get round in a day, by the time you've had lunch etc. You're lucky if you've done 4 5 with appropriate queue times of 1 hour each, we missed the Ratatouille experience ride in the studios as it was a 75 minute wait time and although we didn't learn about fast pass till it was too late, the fast pass next available time to ride was 18.50 so far too late for us to go on as we had a flight to catch.Fast pass is a way to book a time to ride so you don't have to queue as long, well worth it, but no one mentioned it to us when we got there and it would've saved us valuable time. Not all rides have it but most the big ones do.It's definitely worth taking snacks for everyone into the park as the costs inside are a rip off and there's not much choice, it also passes the time when you're bored in the queue!It's pretty essential to book restaurants otherwise you risk not getting in for lunch, dinner didn't seem as busy. We booked The Agrabah Cafe which was great, really nice food and something that suited all of us. We had full board food package plus and this was included and worth it.We also ate at Bistro Chez Remy in WD Studios and this was great fun, limited set menu so check you like the food online before you go, we had steak and it was really nice. Check out separate reviews for the restaurants.We booked a birthday breakfast with the Disney characters at Mickeys Cafe and although our daughter enjoyed it, we were very disappointed. The characters were rubbish, Mickey and Tigger ok but the cobbler out of Pinocchio??! And a random yellow bunny who we didn't know. The buffet breakfast was limited and poor quality, greasy bacon mainly fatty, the usual mini croissants that don't taste fresh and some yogurts and the usual continental meats which I wouldn't even feed a cat! We were hoping for Disney princesses but there weren't any. We also didn't pay extra for a birthday cake as there was only the 4 of us and it was around    30, but that meant they didn't sing happy birthday to our daughter like they did the other children, we could've said something but we wanted to get out and get in the park and she didn't seem to bothered. Overall pretty poor value and I wouldn't recommend it.If you are flying into Charles de Gaulle airport the TGV train is a very easy option to get to Disneyland and it's a fast train that takes 10 minutes. Make sure you book online and pick tickets up from the yellow machines in the terminal 2. Make sure you're on time though as we missed our train on the way there on Friday night at 9.17pm and it was the last one, we then got stuck getting a taxi for a rip off    100!! As a last tip, our baby developed an eye infection on the way there and we found a very helpful medical centre in terminal 2 at CDG airport who gave us a prescription for eye drops and she was on the mend in no time.",0
"The only thing better at disney Land is the pirates of the Caribbean ride. Oh and cars land was a hoot, even thru the long lines. Otherwise disneyworld is the best. We had fun & love everything disney & had to go. If u love disney, of coarse u have to go once but I'll never go back since we have disney in Florida in our backyard.",0
"Another frustrating trip to euro Disney . We know that queues are to be expected in any theme park , but here it always seems to be exasperated by rides repeatedly being closed due to technical difficulties. Our wait for crush's coaster was interrupted three times by temporary closures . And this continued during our stay to this ride and quite a few others . ",0
Overall the place was ok but many attractions were closed with no reduction to the entry price. The attractions were OK but nothing like I expected at a Disney Park. Only the Americans can do Disney!!!! All in all though it was an OK day out.,0
"My wife did a brilliant job of researching European school holidays and picked the perfect week for us to go and we essentially had to the place to ourselves. My 4 year old daughter absolutely loved this holiday. We stayed in the main Disneyland Hotel and rarely queued more than 10 minutes for a ride. She met every single character and got all of their signatures in her book and we did every themed restaurant that our food vouchers covered. Every night she was asleep as her head hit the pillow and she adored the shows, parades and night time fireworks spectacle.However there are a lot of problems with this park that we were willing to overlook because it was so quiet     but if you go on a busier week then you may feel very different. Some friends of ours went a couple of weeks later and hated it so much they gave up on the parks and just visited Paris instead. The queues can be so long on busier weeks and the rides themselves are incredibly short compared to other theme parks. Queuing for 45 minutes for a (literally) 45 second teacup ride is just crazy. Many of the rides are quite old and clunky although a 4 year old doesn   t care     she would have spent all day on It   s a Small World if we   d let her. Some though are just embarrassing and need to be knocked down     Star Tours for starters. The backlot tour of the studios was cringingly bad with the same Jeremy Irons video from when I visited 10 years ago. The stunt show was also a joke with 90% talking     although it was amusing to watch people walking out because their children were so bored and the staff   s failed attempts to try and stop them. Undoubtedly the best ride in the place is Ratatouille     they need to be demolishing some of the antique attractions and replacing them with more of this level of technology.The restaurants are eye wateringly expensive and the only way I could stomach the cost was because of the meal vouchers we   d been forced to pre buy. They make out like the vouchers are free but we actually delayed booking for a week just as they introduced the vouchers and the holiday price went up by exactly their value. I was very annoyed at the time, but in hindsight the vouchers did cause us to do things we might have otherwise avoided. They are ridiculously complicated though and you definitely have to pre book everything. Unfortunately you can only do this over the phone and the language barrier can cause confusion. We arrived to find half of our bookings were wrong missing and it was only because of the quiet week that they were able to still fit us in. I would suggest asking for some kind of confirmation of your bookings so you can be absolutely sure they   ve got it right.The signposts from the station are a complete joke and it was near impossible to work out how to get into the park complex and to our hotel (despite the fact that we could actually see it!). We were misdirected twice by station staff and when we got to a security gate right by the hotel we were told it was for staff only that day! The food was consistently appalling, from the in park restaurants to the mass catered school dinner slop at the wild west show. The undisputed low point was their baffling attempt at fine dining with Auberge De Cendrillon princess lunch. We   ve eaten at more Michelin star restaurants than most   but really, who wants sea bream tartare and monkfish with clams and dried apricots during a break between riding pirates of the caribbean and buzz lightyear??? The only half decent things I ate all week was the hotel breakfast and croque monsieur from the shop on main street. You just have to accept you   re not paying for the food, but rather the look on your daughter   s face as she gets 5 minutes of fuss from a character that she genuinely believes is real.The hotel was rather dated and the staff were a bit snooty. I definitely didn   t appreciate being reminded to leave a tip by the waiter in the buffet (I served myself!). The room smelt of electrical burning     which I believe is the ozone from a deep clean to remove smoke smell. I managed to switch to a king size room at checkin that wasn   t offered on any of the booking systems. Its location was excellent too     just a short walk down some stairs to a park entrance. We hadn   t bothered with the Eurostar back service on arrival as we didn   t see the need to rush straight into the park. On departure we were pleased to find we could pay for just the 2nd half of that service and they took our bags to the station for us to collect later.Why oh why did they build it in France? Probably the most culturally protective nation in Europe! I really believe that Disneyland should be a completely over the top American cheese fest and the French were never going to want that in their country. I love France but it   s not the place for Disneyland. It really doesn   t take a degree in business management to understand why this place is a financial disaster. Physically the park is sound because it   s a copy of the American one, but everything else is a car crash. From how it   s marketed and booked, to operated and catered, it   s littered with examples of over complicated or poorly considered processes couple with underinvestment in new technology. And then the simple things     where are the American style coffee shops? I can all but guarantee that every British visitor would but at least one latte or similar a day!Top tip is definitely to let your child dress up as you get the jump the queue on the corresponding ride. However, my daughter   s favourite dress at the time was Snow White and unfortunately that   s one of the worst rides in the place. We still did it a few times so she could get the feeling of being special and jumping the queue. Some families are very organised with multiple outfits     I   d suggest a Buzz Lightyear, Pirate and Cowboy as that   ll get you on 3 of the better rides. The other advantage of dressing up is it can make your child more noticeable to the characters     my daughter received a lovely reaction each time from the Snow White in the parades.I   m torn what rating to give Disneyland as I definitely believe we completely fluked this break and would never be able to repeat it. Should I give it 5* because of how we experienced it, or 3* for how I think 99% of visits would be? We won   t be going back because I   m convinced a future visit would be a massive let down     although definitely looking forward to doing it    properly    in the true American way soon!",0
"This is an entree size of the original Los Angeles Disneyland.They have a small scaled down version of Adventureland, Fantasyland and Tomorrowland, although there appears to be extensions going on.Main Street is like LA Disneyland.If you're after the thrilling rollercoaster rides, Space Mountain is the only one. Alot of the exciting rides are not there.It's geared more for the smaller market but you can still get that Disney buzz with the character photos and parades. While I get that when in Asia, I have to eat Asian, but the food selection was disappointing from a Western perspective. It is easy to get to on public transport   catch the Disney train from Sunny Bay (near the airport).",0
"Disneyland Park is a great place to visit. But it seems no matter what time of day you get there, the lines are already long !!!! The prices of the food is outrageous and you don't get great food on top of that ! I think Mr. Disney makes enough money with the ticket prices alone, the prices should be more reasonable for items purchased in the park.Wait time for rides is crazy and the fast pass is not that helpful, since you have to return at a certain time, you may as well wait your turn in line versus coming back an hour or two later.... you're spending the same amount of time waiting in line.",0
"I went to Disneyland in California for Thanksgiving over a decade ago and, despite being an angry confused teenager I had a very nice time and was very impressed. I went to Disneyland Paris with my husband for Christmas. We were there on Christmas Eve 2014. The lines were okay, not nearly as bad as I had been lead to believe, but the park just hasn't got the same je ne sais quoi as the one in Anaheim. Nothing really bad about it, but nothing really good either. We are both adults though, so maybe it just wasn't for us, but I would think that a kitch loving adult would get more fun out of the experience than a moody 15 year old would.",0
"I was disappointed in this park. The day that I went, half of the rides were closed and so people were just walking around looking for something that was open for them to ride. The food was awful, but that was no surprise based upon other reviews. The Ratatouille ride was cute, and so was the Finding Nemo. They were the best park of the park. There is no escaping the endless smoking, people smoking in line, people smoking everywhere and all over the children. Not used to that in 2017.",0
"Three E Ticket attractions closed on the same day simply isn't acceptable.I Love Disneyland... even better than Disney World... but it kind of feels like if you;re not an annual pass holder you aren't important.WDW would NEVER make you feel like this and cater for the  once in a lifetimer .I'm fortunate enough to know I will visit DL again but it might not be for 10 years or so!We travelled from England for my 30th Birthday all I wanted was to go to DL. Thursday the 14th of September as our day to visit only to find Space Mountain and the Haunted mansion were closed (for halloween make overs presumably so they could make and extra buck off of the annual pass holders and screw the once in a lifetimers) and Indianna Jones was closed for refurbishment....3 Etickets closed.... 3.... did I get a discount, no? Was I warned when buying my tickets... no? Was I compensated in anyway???? no!I found out on the gate.... when it was too late.Simply not good enough Disney.... simply not good enough.TDA normally puts TDO to shame but they let me and every other guest that day down... turning Disneyland into a half day park!",0
"having booked the tickets for me and my sister to take our two younger cousins as a suprise, i think we were more excited then the children. we decided to drive there on ferry which we will never be doing ever again, but finally getting to disneyland, we unpacked and went for dinner. at 29euros each all you can eat (very expensive) for people who dont eat much and the variety of food was limited. 1st day in park, well it was Halloween and halfterm which definately not the best time to go, ques are upto 120mins for some rides and with kids isnt fun. the Hallowen show was absolutly AMAZING !!! THE LIGHT SHOW WOW. second day we visited the studios next door same length of time for rides so for every ride we spent a minimum of an hour waiting. the Magic Circus hotel was good, very clean and tidy, and with swimming pool, and bus to park frequently. all in all the holiday was great, but next time wil bring more money for food as very expensive, not be driving and definately not be going during school holidays x.",0
"This is our first time to Disneyland Paris... and sadly probably our last. I'd rather spend the money going to experience the real Disney magic in Florida!We stayed along with our two nephews (7 yrs and 2 yrs) and Brother and Sister In Law. Accommodation I've reviewed separately but worth adding here as that too didn't particularly inspire the Disney magic. We visited over the week 11   15th December. The weather wasn't exactly great as two of the days we encountered rain all day. This wouldn't have been so bad but throughout the park a number of attractions and restaurants are closed for refurbishment so all of the other attractions and restaurants are crammed full. The park itself is good in as much as it is what we expected. Beautifully laid out and the illuminations and parade amazing. Definitely worth a watch and guaranteed to bring a smile to your face. The park isn't as clean as Disney World and Disney Land also distinctly lacks the 'Disney customer service' that seems ever so apparent in Florida. Smiles were few and far between from the staff and if you asked a question a grunt or point was what you would likely get. That said I must say there was one member of staff in Bistrot Chez Remy who was lovely. I didn't get her name but she couldn't do enough and was very friendly   what you would expect from Disney. I mentioned cleanliness. The toilets aren't as clean as you would expect and there was quite a lot of litter about. Granted this is due to the messy idiots who visit the park but it lets the park down all the same. One of the other things that lets the park down is the music around the park. In Florida you hear Disney everywhere. In Paris you didn't. Very strange and almost a let down. You heard it on some of the atttractions along with a strange mix of other music. Really hope that now Disney corp have full control over this park they sort it out. It needs a good shake up to give it the Disney magic that customers expect from such a park. You should get this 100% of the time, not just during the parade or illuminations.",0
"I've been an annual pass holder for years and every year I debate to renew or not. I go less and less each year, they're so crowded now and the quality of everything is suffering . Even the crowd now is so different, so ghetto...smelly, rude, women changing kids diapers outside the bathrooms, kids stepping all over plants, trash. It's horrendous . Not what I used to be. Not sure how these people can afford the passes with all those kids but they won't go away anytime soon. Disneyland is still pretty but little by little it's turning into an ugly street fair . ",0
"Well, Disneyland Paris has a kind of identity crisis in my humble opinion. The people who longed to see Donald, Pluto, Chip'n'Dale or their Star Wars heroes are no children anymore. Thrill seekers are better off with e.g. Europa Park. The management has clearly realized the problem and tries to introduce new attractions   good thinking. Still, value for money is currently average at best, as the prices remain higher than the competitors come up with, and there is clearly some catching up to do. Just do not miss Indiana Jones, Star Tours, the Parade, get lucky with the Big Thunder Mountain queue and lack of closures (they happen often) and you will have a fine day. A single one will suffice.",0
"I took the God grandkids to Disneyland; well my God son took his kids & we got to go too. The first thing I should say is they had a terrific time! They road most of the rides, ate heaps of popcorn & cotton candy while we tanked up on Starbucks so we could keep up with sugar amped kids on stimulus overload. They fell asleep each night with smiles on their faces & from their parents POV, mission accomplished BUT....I was incredibly frustrated by the state of the park today & the number of rides closed for repair or remodeling. This was the second time in a decade I have endured the challenge of 'The Magic Kingdom' & the previous time it was even worse!I travel a lot and I am often asked where to go in America and I once had NO hesitation saying Disneyland. To me it symbolized the best spirit of my country. However I would be remiss if I said it now. There are too many people competing for too few rides or events compounded by too many rides behind walls for construction. I was assured this was merely because they were getting ready for their big 60th anniversary bash , but their weren't accommodations made in ticket prices or attendance! Disney is keen to take the money but not so gracious as to schedule their repairs & or renovations more sparsely or to give fair warning to their customers BEFORE they buy their expensive ticket packages. We were there (both times) in the 'off season' and yet endured long lines and got to within sight of nirvana only to be told the ride was down and we could take a chance they might be able to fix it by continuing to wait or give up your hour investment and go try some other ride's line????Like I said, the kids rolled with it but I felt the customer service was poor & for a park of that name & stature this was very disappointing!All & all, I believe you would be smart to skip Disneyland, at least in So Cal, and try Legoland or Magic Mountain.",0
"As expected of Disney their rides and facilities were top notch, but it was such a dissapointment that the service was not up to that standed.I am aware that Hong Kong culture can come across as being unfreindly, but I expected a lot more of the Disney staff. They were exeedingly unhelpful and made my family and I feel very unwelcome, it wouldn't hurt them to so much as try putting on a smile. Such a shame that the  Happiest place on earth  had the saddest people.",0
"If you want to go to a theme park then fine, but if you've been to WDW Florida, don't expect any of the same Disney Magic here in Paris. It is just like any other theme park, crowded, dirty, rubbish everywhere, dirty toilets, indifferent staff, long long queues for fast food, over priced tat in the shops pilled up everywhere with no one to tidy it up, some of the rides look shabby and a bit broken. I was disappointed. We went on a busy day so we were prepared to queue but nothing prepared us for the shock of the way the staff were either indifferent to whether everyone was having a good time or completely absent. Several times we were told to queue (pointed, not asked) in the wrong place and then almost man handled into the right place. Star tours, for example, had broken seat belts and rubbish in the simulator. BTM had a 45 minutes sign but we queued over 1 hour. We were the only people in the burger bar opposite at 11am yet it took the staff 15 minutes to complete our order. There were no characters anywhere except in the parade. The parade was good but there were only 4 floats, one group of 12 dancers and 3 green men from Toy Story. Its a good job it came around twice! No balloon sellers or photographers on Main Street. There was no cast member interaction at either the Haunted Mansion, or Pirates of the Carribean, although we asked a cast member if we could ride in the front and he said yes. How much nicer it would have been if he had asked us though! I never saw a single cleaner in any of the seating areas or in the toilets the whole time we were there. The French are known for their filthy toilets I know but these were no better than anywhere else in France. Last we were going to eat at the Agrabah Restaurant as there were big signs everywhere for it but when we got there it was closed. Why did no body bother to take the signs down if it wasn't open? It has the Disney name but it is everything Walt Disney hated about theme parks when he took his daughters to them in the 1950's. That is why he build Disneyland in Anaheim and I am sure he would be horrified to see what has been done here in France with his name on it. I went to Alton Towers, UK's best theme park in 2010, and it has really up ed its game since Tussauds bought it out. Staff were helpful and friendly, often on hand to direct you about and ask if you are enjoying yourself and there were cleaners about in plenty. Its worth staying this side of the chanel for that. It is the little things, not the lack of queues that make a good day and Disney needs to take its staff back to basics or else take the Disney name off the park and sell out. Save your money and go to Florida or California instead.",0
"We travel to Disneyland Paris, on average, once per year and, for us, this will probably be our last for quite a while for a number of reasons; tired d  cor, slow service and rides not running. We stayed at Hotel New York (our fourth stay at this hotel) and the customer service was exceptional. The check in lady was efficient.The same cannot, however, be said for customer service at Magic Kingdom. We all had colds so we were regularly queuing for hot drinks. The shortest queue we stood in took 25 minutes and there were probably only five people in front of us! Whether it was the coffee machine or the speed of the server, this was a really boring (expensive) way to spend our limited time at the park. We wasted most of our 'extra magic hour' (a perk of staying at a Disney hotel) walking around the park to find a ride that was working   there seem to be lots of 'technical issues'. The whole place is beginning to look tired and this is the first time I've come away from Disney feeling disappointed and not eager to plan the next trip. A real shame.",0
"The park was very small.It will be great for families but because i had been to the orlando disney i was very dissapointed.although saying that we had a meal in walt disney house it was brilliant and tasted lovely not badly priced too 103 euros for two.The train to get there from paris was very scary, not bad getting there in the morning but coming back was odd had locals jumping the barrier to get a free ride. on our train back there was a group of guys comparing what they had stole. so i wouldnt suggest taking train its alot cheaper however a very scary process.",0
Disney in Hongkong  is small compared to others. And if you have seen one in Orlando this one will be very small. There are not many rides or shows. But again disney is disney no matter what. Soforget about reality and let your imagination fly.,0
"We have annual passports for the first time, although Disneyland has been fun, the price per day is way too expensive for all that you can really do in a day! The ride wait times are far too long for kids. Not all the rides, but the most popular ones! You spend 2 hours waiting for the cars adventure ride, cranky kids all around, can't go to the bathroom or u loose your spot! This is too long to ask even an adult to stand! A 90 min wait today at cars, my son was so annoyed and there were kids and adults cranky at the happiest place on earth! Then space mountain, 60 minutes, then the water raft ride 75 minutes! U spend your whole day at Dianeyland waiting in line and for $100 that doesn't feel good! If you park hop, like we did today I paid $155 for another person to go along with us today. We spent 1 2 our time waiting in line! Disneyland, you've got to do better for the customers! U pay all that money to get in and really can't get the full experience! After paying on top of all that $17 to park and the cheapest eat  an $8 Corn dog! Not fair Dianeyland, where's all this money going? One could never go on a date day here, without spending $217 just to get in the park. I'm over it, but at least glad I have the passports for my son to experience. We only got on 5 rides the whole day with all this waiting and it's Thursday. On The weekend u might as well forget it! good things that bathrooms weren't filthy and no lines and the night shows are great if u can get a spot to see! fast pass seems the way to go for rides, but it's kind of not fair to standby people in line that have been waiting forever for them to go ahead when we all pay the same fee to get in the park! Disneyland! Youve got to come up with much better alternatives, for the whole family to feel happy about such an expensive experience!",0
"Small but good for those who never been to Disneyland park before.The newly open ToyStory land is great for kids under 12 yrs old.Overall like all Disneyland, it's expensive, If you have been to other Disnetyland, then you like to give this one a miss.",0
"There must be a maximum number of people Disney can let into the park before it turns into total bedlam and the say ok shut the doors no more for today. Well we must of timed it at one of the worst times to go. Spring break April 3 rd & 4 th. FAST PASS  slightly less agony waiting. The worst line was for the jungle cruise. We got into haunted house and pirates of the carrabian while a show was on at nine pm only waited 20 min. Indiana jones was ok about 15 min and inside at least interesting decor. I went on 3 roller coasters to make my child happy, she cried out of shear fear and I was terrified I was going to put my back out, why can't they pad the seats, is that too much to ask. Having said that next time I come I am renting one of those sit down scooters, seems to me if you rent one of those you go to the front of the   allegedly handicapped  line and get on rides almost right away. I never saw so many motorised scooters in one place, they needed their own traffic lights and road rules. I recommend visiting the magic shop and watching one of the guys show you a few tricks, we then bought our kid a trick to do at home that was demonstrated. There are a lot of things one can do in this world with children that are more fun for them and the adults than Disneyland.",0
"It's best for 14 years old and below, not for everyone. But the rides and attractions are great, plus parade is awesome. Fireworks are so so especially if you've seen pyro olympics. As expected food and beverage are expensive. What ruined our trip, though, was the prevalence of rude tourists who have the habit of queue jumping. And in our six hour stay there I have seen a couple of fights from different tourists. Literally shouting. Very bad sight for kids. I have been hearing things like this about HK Disneyland from other people. I am not sure though if Disneyland can do something about it. Best place to visit in November to February; comfy weather.",0
"Biggest issue..3 of the rides we were on, we were stopped in the middle of the ride. The Haunted Mansion after Halloween was great. Indiana Jones, It's A Small World closed and we couldn't get to the Walt Disney statue because they were setting up for filming the next day. The Stampede show stumbled through their lines. Still, the characters were great. Too expensive for one day.",0
Whilst I love Disneyland Paris this visit was somewhat of a disappointment. On one day four main attractions were all broken and shut due to technical problem. This was very much a whistle stop for us this year on the way further south and Disney had definitely lost it's magic for us. After holidaying twice a year at Disneyland Paris for the past 10 years or so I'm not sure if we'll return again. It's the first time ever that I haven't come home and started planning our next trip   feeling rather sad.,0
"I'll probably be heavily criticised by Disney fans but honestly I just wasn't feeling the magic. Perhaps it was the heat of the summer's day but I couldn't really appreciate any of the rides that I had really looked forward to. Indiana Jones was the most exciting. Ratatouille was worth the queue but most of the others were a disappointment, particularly Pirates of the Caribbean. The closures due to next year's anniversary celebrations were probably a big factor. Was the low point of our Parisian adventure. Unless you're a huge Disney fan save the visit for the US parks. Stick to the magic of Paris. There's more than enough in this wonderful city to delight without being distracted by an American icon. ",0
"My 4.75 year old and I visited HK Disneyland during Chinese school holidays which meant it was hot, humid and crowded. Average wait time for rides was close to 1 hour which is a big ask for a little person. When we did get in (had some problems with the vouchers I purchased through Expedia) the Customer Relations gave us some  Fast Passes  for a few rides. This was definitely the way to go because it meant we only had to wait about 10 15 minutes for the rides (Buzz Lightyear & Pooh Bear). A good tip is also to go on the rides as a 'single' because it's about 1 4 the wait time compared to going in a group especially Space Mountain. It's also handy to buy an Octypus train pass so you don't have to que up to buy single tickets when returning to your destination.",0
"If you have traveled from afar to visit the Magic Kingdom in California, you may want to reconsider for the time being. Not only is the park extremely busy (because of Spring Break) but there are many areas closed due to construction. Because of the various closures, the park is difficult to navigate, especially the California Adventure side. I'd have to guess that a quarter of that park is under construction and it is extremely frustrating to get get around. Not only that, but all of the rides on the back half of the lot are shut down during the evening performances of the World of Color show. We were hoping to ride the roller coaster while all of the families were busy watching the show, but that was a wash. Additionally, you couldn't get any fast passes for either Soaring over California or the Toy Story ride (as well as Thunder Mountain on the other side), they simply didn't offer them and the wait times were painfully long.On the Disneyland side, Splash Mountain is going to be closed for some time, as is Star Tours. Besides this, the rides that we wanted to go on had 55 65 minute waits. We never did make it on Space Mountain. We did manage to sneak on Thunder Mountain and The Pirates of the Caribbean during Fantasmic.I have got to say that of the many times that my wife and I have come the 1000 miles to Disneyland, this was certainly my least favorite. Besides all of this, it seems that every time we go to Disneyland there are more and more, bigger and bigger stroller everywhere. They have got to do something about this. I can't count how many times I was run into, cut off, or stuck behind one of those massive SUV carts that people call strollers. I felt like I was back on the I 5 behind a group of semi trucks going up a hill. I realize that Disneyland is about the kids, but if they are too small to remember the trip, too small to stay awake, too small to go on the rides, and too small to be up way past their bedtime, maybe mom and dad should wait a few years and leave the stroller at home. Don't get me wrong, my wife and I are both huge Disney fans, and any day in Disneyland still beats being at work, but at $101.00 each for the day, it would be nice to know some of these things beforehand. Of course I recommend going to Disneyland, however, not right now, there is way too much construction going on, and never during peak seasons like Spring Break, Summer, Christmas,Thanksgiving week and a week or two on either end of these dates..... even weekends are iffy.",0
good....MTR make it approachable....good staff... buy ticket online....or contact your hotel... one day is not enough atlest with children... food is horrible ...not for vegetarians...,0
"This park does not come close to meeting the quality standards that Disney USA parks set. There is a severe lack of staff. No programs available and definitely not distributed at entrance to park. Fast pass is not operated efficiently   3 major rides were out of service (Thunder Mountain, Small World, Pirates of C), we were very disappointed. At least the tickets are cheaper and lines shorter than in US. Many restaurants close by 3pm, so finding dinner was troublesome (actually downright annoying). We stood in line longer to obtain lunch than we did most rides. No smoking is not enforced by any park employees. In fact we witnessed a guest (a kid) relieving himself in the bushes rather than finding a bathroom. There is no free wifi.Staff at the emporium were the only ones to meet the Disney standard and the castle light show at 11pm is a definite must see. Otherwise, this park is  been there, done that  for us.Highly recommend taking the train, we easily made the first train after the conclusion of the light show to return to our hotel.",0
We spent 2.5 days here. The Disneyland park is compact compared to Disney World (DW) Magic Kingdom. The lines are long and the cast members are not so magical. On numerous occasions we over heard cast members talking badly about customers and we were not interacted with in a magical positive way as in DW parks. The park was clean Remember this is a theme park and you will pay theme park prices $$$$,0
"We purchased a 3 day park hopper ticket, spent 2 full days in Disneyland and 1 full day at California Adventure park . A very disappointing and frustrating time in both parks with wait times on rides in excess of 1 and 2 hours, long wait times to get pics taken with characters, fast passes all exhausted for the day before 10 am in Adventure Park, rides not operating. Yes both parks are a magically place if you just want to walk around but the hype doesn't live up to the reality if you want to experience everything on offer.",0
"The all park is nice BUT how is possible that you come there with kids and want to take some photos with famous Disney cartoons like Mickey and Minnie and they don   t let you. Ok I understand that people need rest but than you need to have few of this cartoons to take photos not just one. They are photographying for 1 hour after that they are on pausa another hour and people are waiting them to come back, they let group of people after that they say it   s over no more photos.... I don   t understand that policy",0
We came here for my daughters first visit. It seemed as though every ride we tried to go on was broken at the time and we would have to come back to it later. I understand it but it was frustrating. I recommend leaving during peak hours and coming back later or early morning. ,0
"The Disneyland is very small compare to L.A., It is less clean compare to Tokyo Disneyland. Full of people (locals and tourists). Many of the tourists from China (Mandarin speaking people), they don't have sense of personal space and don't have correct concept of queue or line.Beside the rudeness of the tourists, everything was fine. My kids enjoyed most of the rides as they are the same as in US and Japan. If you had visited other Disneyland or Disney world, I don't recommend this. There are a lot of interesting place you can go visit in HK. We went to Kam Shan Country Park and encounter with many monkeys and wild boar.If you must go, please visit during weekdays to avoid large crowd.",0
"This was a very special trip for 7 kids and 8 adults that was 2 years in the making   so hopes and expectations were high!You can't deny the magic of the setting and the various parades, and the look on the kids faces! The few rides that were open were fun and exhilarating, particular liked the shows (Stitch, Enchanted Forest and Stunt). For the kids I was, still am, trying to remain positive but there was a number of 'let downs':   large and unfair queueing system for rides (average 30 40mins)  Too many popular rides closed (Aerosmith, Thunder Mountain, Phantom Manor, Star Tours....and many more)  Disney Characters.....grrrrr....you bump into them around the park and you start to queue, then as your kids get to front the characters jump run around and stop 10 yards in another place   meaning all the kids at the back of the line, or even kids that had not queued at all, were suddenly at the front and yours at the back!!! And they continually did this......honestly my blood was boiling  Merchandise very expensive and shoved down your throat at every opportunity  Food OK quality but again expensive and service very slowTop Tip   there is a newsagent type shop at the train station, stock up here on nibbles and drinks! Crisps in park      3 a pack, same pack at train station      1.50!",0
"Having a 5 year old kid who's a fan of Disney characters, we've been visiting Hongkong Disneyland for several times already. From 2010 to this year's visit, I noticed that there were less English fluent speaking guides and staff available and less smiling attendants to greet the...More",0
"Maybe it's because without the aid of young children the Disneyland Experience is like Marmite, you either love it or hate it. Well maybe hate is to strong a word. We sytayed for 4 nights and 5 days and after day 3 i would have been happy to jump on the train and go back home. All the big rides done, some of the small rides done and the wallet was nearly empty through the expence of being in the Disney bubble. If you have young children the appeal is the Disney characters and processions. We took a 10, 12 and 15 year old and the interest in processions, Disney characters was further back than going on all the thrill rides and watching the stunt shows. Tower of Terror, Areosmiths Roller costers, Space mountain, Thunder mountain and Star Tours were much more favoured over chasing characters for a picture or seeing a prade. I have now been to Disney Florida and Paris and would rate the lay out of the Paris better, not as many parks but the Disney Village, Studios and main park are all right next to each other. The cost for eating is way to much, the maintenance on some of the rides   a little less impressive than the Amercian counter parts (Aerosmith Rock n Rolla is not half as impressive when it doesn't have the music playing for several days). We stayed at one of the Hotels recomended by Disney with the free shuttle bus (you are now captured in the Disney bubble), with the hotel swimming pool and ball pool on offer the kids spent hour playing in these each evening, All that said we had a nice time, but wouldn't do it again (couldn't afford it).",0
"We went there on Sep 3 labor day week end. The ride was great! Racing the other car. But waiting in line with hardly any shade. No water fauctes. Also waiting in line for three hours.  Suggestions. Bring sunscreen, hats and Umbrellas.",0
"Disney Paris is nice. I always feel happy when I go to disney. Thing is, some of the rides are in french. Also, I have been to disney orlando before and Orlando seemed bigger and better. The positive thing about it is that the evening firework show is extraordinary. Food is not that great in parks. Also, in the middle of the day, you can take the RER C train to Val Europe station where you can have a nice lunch in the mall and visit Val d'europe outlet which is nice.",0
"Have been an annual pass holder for several years. Recent increases, along with a recent extremely crowded visit, long lines, crazy traffic, not sure we will be renewing after this year.",0
Writing this review whilst still in Disney. Up to now had a great time the rides are great the park is very clean & staff are friendly however the people who visit the park are not so friendly I've never come across so many awful people in my life they all look so miserable it's very odd. It's very very expensive totally overpriced for absolutely everything & that's saying something for me I'm not tight at all. I did expect it to be a bit overpriced but not this much ridiculous. My little boy is having a ball tho & his fave ride is pirates of Caribbean which I also thought was very good. The food here isn't great to be honest a lot of overpriced fast food the parades were great tho. So much queuing so wear comfy shoes & clothing waiting an hour for each ride today which I suppose you expect. Don't think I will visit again but still had a nice time here despite a few issues. ,0
This park is well kept in some places and very dirty in others. You hardly see any characters walking around and the rides have long queues for what seems like 30 secs of rides. Our 3 year old enjoyed himself and I guess that's all that matters after all. :),0
"The magic is getting smaller,This was my 6th visit to this park. It seems to me that the park needs to be renovated very quickly.In the past I always enjoyed a visit but now I was disappointed. Altough I visited the park in the passed when there were many people, I was very pleased, but now  yesterday  it was a catastrophy. Several attractions, Space Mountain,Nemo, The Mining Company, Buts lightyear,Star Tours and others were several times out of duty. So it was inpossible to follow are planning and in addition of very long waiting times we lost a hole day of pleasure ( we stayed 3 days).Of course we knew there would be a lot of people, it's seems that they were not capable to handle such a mass.Sorry Disney Paris, shame on you.Positive : the beatifull laser show.",0
"Disneyland as a park gets five stars, however, the crowds and prices drop it down. Going during the week or the weekend doesn't seem to make any difference in the crowd level as its always busy. Waiting almost an hour for a single ride is the norm. Forget doing anything after the parade or the shows as you're herded like cattle , shoulder to shoulder in a direction you don't want to go. I can understand raising the prices to lower the crowds, but apparently they haven't found that curve yet as people still pour into the park. Food prices are astronomical as are any souvenirs, but there cheap places to eat outside the park. Disney needs to move some shows to California Adventure and keep that park open until 2am. Probably won't ever come back again despite the cool rides.",0
"The park is a much smaller version of the Disneyland of LA or Disneyworld of Florida. We enjoyed it but missed see the complete park that we had seen several time in California. The shows were wonderful and the staff was very good, helpful and always pleasant and caring to the kids that were so excited to see their favorite Disney Characters",0
"I grew up coming to Disneyland every summer for the past 50 years so we brought family here from abroad to spend the day and we were disappointed! Indiana jones , Hyperspace, Matterhorn and even Peter Pan experienced system glitches throughout the day so the rides were down for he at a time ( Indiana jones down several times throughout) fast pass out and after talking so much about the fireworks and watching crowds waiting for over an hr an announcement came that the fireworks would be delayed ....and then ...none this evening ! At 11pm the Peter Pan ride was open do we braved the line and the ride was great but very warm since no air conditioning. With all the profits over the years and the price we paid for 6 tickets we left bummed!",0
I had not been there for fifteen years but my opinion has not changed much. It is fun for a day but I would not stay any longer. Since my previous visit I had acquired two children but still managed to do everything I wanted in five hours. There still seems to be more places to eat and shop than rides.,0
"We have no kids  we are big kids  even so , this side of the park is very geared towards little kids. Lots of kiddie rides and princess hoopla, etc. We are grateful that we went 5 Dec 9 Dec. We hardly had to wait for anything. 15 minutes was the longest due to not a ton of people and FAST PASSES. Seriously  BEST time of year to go. Our favorite thing was the Jedi Training Camp; it was the cutest thing ever and very well done. Even though we don't have kids, we almost went back to see it again, because it was so entertaining! The main guy was charismatic and funny. Our favorite ride was Star Tours  that was pretty fun, we went twice and got a different  adventure.  I learned later there are 54 different ones. We did one where we almost fell into a snowy mountain gorge and one with a pod race...well done! (I always wanted to know what it would be like to be in a pod race! ;) )",0
"If this was my first Disney experience it may have been different for me. It is much less expensive than Anaheim or Orlando but it is much smaller with far fewer attractions, many of which were closed when I was there. The gardens are lovely. I am glad I went, but probably won't return.",0
"This visit was 2 adults with no kids, so remember that as you read this. We were in and out in 3 hours and half of that was standing in line for the Nemo Submarine ride. I've been to Disney World hundreds of times, so when you see Cinderella's castle here it just seems sad. If you have kids, I'm sure you would enjoy it because of all the princesses and characters you can visit, and it's a just a good family park. I would probably go back to California Adventures before I came here again.",0
"I would suggest even for at least one time. Eat at the restaurant overlooking pirates of the carribean a bit pricey. But, The surroundings is well worth it. Go to the back of California experience.Where you can buy salad and soup in bread bowls. You can see a short film about making bread and see it being made after the film. Make sure you buy a Mickey bread for the kids. Where else could you buy this bread. And the kids will have a great time eating Mickey's ears.",0
"It's always fun but the lines and crowds get on the nerves after a while. Being pushed, people cutting into a line that you have been waiting in and rides not running get annoying after a while",0
The staff at Disneyland I found were quite rude. Orlando Disney staff way more friendly and helpful. 5 times getting a bus shuttle the bus driver drove off as we were standing there and the bus was half empty. Told us  I have to go. Oh well you guys can get the next one . The very rude cast member onNew Years arguing with my husband and yelling at him as we were all following instructions to move to designated area for fire works and cast member following behind us telling us to move faster and get out of area at the time. Very disappointed. I know they have a job to do and organization is important but the rude body language and verbal inappropriateness was not appropriate. Next time will go to Disney world in Florida. Have been to Disney Paris as well and was good. Overall the park itself is nice. Food is very overpriced and unhealthy. For a park catering to families with children they should offer more healthy food and snacks instead of fast food. Would not visit this park again. Haven't been here for 25 years ( I was 14 last time) and I know why. ,0
"The magical experience started when we got on the MTR train. I was quite impressed with the Mickey shaped windows and beautiful Disney themed interior. It made me feel like I was no longer in Hong Kong! The entrance was big   just like how Disneyland should be, and there was a nice Mickey fountain for photo opportunities. As we walked along the Main Street my memories of other Disney parks came to me and I was instantly familiar with the surrounding buildings, shops and street decorations. Then someone pointed out the Castle. I looked up expecting to see a magnificent Castle but all I could see was the sky and a lot of people in front of me. Then behind all those people I saw the Castle... It was so small that we all laughed out loud, couldn't believe how pathetic it was! I was very disappointed. So to cheer myself up I decided to check the times for my favourite show   the Festival of the Lion King and then I saw that the show wasn't on! I can't remember being this disappointed in my life! We walked around the park then it was time for the Parade. Watching the Parade cheered me up a lot and reminded me how magical Disneyland is   no matter where you are! Even the fireworks were up to the high standard that Disney should be!The park is quite small so I was glad that we went on a Wednesday or we wouldn't be able to see anything through the crowd! They are expanding the park with a new land coming very soon so I will be visiting again. I hope that in the future they will re build the Castle because to me it is the centre of the magical park. It should be huge, it should make you gasp at how beautiful it is and it should be the centre of attention!",0
"Our experience at Disneyland Paris was, in one word, weird. I suppose we came expecting the same Disney Magic that is present at Disneyworld, but these two places simply aren   t comparable. For what it is, it   s nice, I suppose. It has the rides and the characters and the shows and all that jazz, but I would suggest that American tourists skip it. For a few reasons:  You   ll have to take a whole say out of your Paris itinerary to fit this in. It   s not worth it. We are Disney fanatics if there ever were any, but there is more magic in the heart of Paris than here.  Lines are long; we rode maybe 4 5 rides during our entire day there.  The place is outdated. We rode the    new    space mountain. Thing looks like it was built in 1995.  WHERE IS THE FOOD? This one confused me. We wandered the park, from about 7:00 to 9:00, searching tirelessly for food. Restaurant after restaurant was temporarily closed (and there was no way of funding this out before you arrived there) and we were there on a Sunday in June. We hadn   t eaten much all day, and I was internally begging,    Someone please, take my money and give me sustenance!    We finally found one cafe, and we waited in line for no less than an hour for our overpriced cold pizza and sour pasta salad that tasted great after our eternal quest.Overall, if you   ve flown across the world to come to Paris, spend your extra day at Versailles or in the gardens or museums. We   ve got Disney back home, and it   s infinitely better than this Six Flags Posing as Disney    la France.Also, the fireworks aren   t fireworks. It   s a light show. It   s legit, but it   s not fireworks.",0
"The tickets are expensive for this mediocre experience well outside of Paris. The wait is long for rides of short duration. One venue was closed. Food was nothing special, again with long queues (food used to be better at the French pavilion at Epcot center). What was evident was a desperate money grab with shops selling all kinds of junk and trinkets. The Walt Disney Studio Park next door prevented a totally useless experience ... but even then I wouldn't take the plane from North America to see it.",0
"With park entry prices increased, it makes it very difficult to take a family vacation to Disneyland and be able to buy food and drinks and other memorabilia for the kids (never mind the adult kids) while in the park. If it   s meant to be the happiest place on earth, then the CEO needs to adjust the cost and make it more affordable for families.",0
"I am a HUGE Disney fan, having visited all five main Disney Parks across the globe and have visited Disneyland Park Paris twice with each of my daughters. Although I had reservations the first time visiting I chalked it up to maybe the day but purists beware, although the grounds are Disney and the rides Disney, that special feel that truly sets these parks apart from the rest is not Disney. On both occasions, two of the major rides were broke down (kissed those fast passes goodbye) but what really got me was the staff. I think I saw a couple of them smile but their halfhearted efforts at making this a special day was very noticeable   more like teenagers working the local amusement park. I also could not believe the amount of smoking that went on in the park and although not the parks fault per se, there did not appear to be any effort to address it   this again on both occasions (smokers might like it!). The 45 minute, somewhat expensive train ride to and from Paris kind of adds to it as well but hey, I guess parking at the other Disney Parks is not great eitherStill had fun but please just be aware, especially if travelling a long distance to get here and or having this a main focus of your trip to Paris ( I know, it's sad as it kind of was initially mine as it was the one main park I had not visited) that you may be a little disappointed, especially if you know what to compare it to but if you are with kids, they are going to love it regardless.",0
"most of the food outlets were closed for refurbishment, and several of the rides were also closed, and on several rides you queued before you found out the children were not tall enough",0
"Recently visited Disneyland HK with 8 year old in tow. Entry price seemed high but prepared to pay for the experience. Unfortunately the experience didn't live up to expectations. It didn't take long for waiting times on all rides to be 1 hour and access to eateries limited due to crowd numbers. When we did finally get to eat the prices were outrageous  I guess that's what you can get away with when you have a captive audience! We did really enjoy the Lion King show and the parade was great, so not all bad. Overall I thought the target audience was very much around the 4 to 8 year old, nothing much for older kids. For much better value we also visited ocean world HK where price was cheaper, rides and experiences much more appealing. My advice  skip Disneyland and spend your money at ocean world !",0
"Here's an abridged copy of the complaint email I've sent to DLP...I visited with my teenage daughter and her friend. We last visited 10 years ago when my children were much younger, and I have to say that the park has seriously declined in that time.  We have only ever visited during school holidays, so knew that it was going to be very crowded, and we arrived before the official opening time, expecting long queues around the busiest parts of the day.  We didn't mind the queues and thoroughly enjoyed the rides and attractions once we were able to reach them, but, a major difference from our previous visits was that there were far fewer Disney  cast members  around to answer any queries or give directions. Furthermore, while some of them were polite and helpful, a number were more like Grumpy from the Seven Dwarfs   no smiles and unwilling or unable to offer much help. In comparison, when we have visited in the past, there were plenty of Disney staff in evidence throughout the queues (not just at the embarkation point), who would chat and answer questions   and crucially, ask people to stop smoking. This time I was appalled at the number of people smoking cigarettes around the park with no one stopping them.  For an attraction aimed at young children, with rules that ask people not to smoke outside designated areas, this is unforgivable.  Although we were able to avoid smokers walking around the park, we of course had no option to stand near them if they were smoking in the (long) queues. Had I seen any cast members in evidence, I would have pointed this out and asked the staff member to tell the smokers to stop   but the apparent reduction in staffing meant it was not possible for me to complain to anyone in authority.  We queued for 50 minutes to ride Pirates of the Caribbean, only for the ride to break down before we had chance to embark. While these sort of things do happen, it left me wondering if your evident reduction in staffing levels is also extending to less maintenance for the rides. And the queueing area for Big Thunder Mountain was dirty, with overflowing rubbish bins   I have attached a photograph I took as we queued for an hour for this ride. Not the sort of holiday picture I really want to bring home, and it reflects on your organisation very badly. It appears that far from the Disney  Magic , what has developed is an attitude of far less attention to detail, a lack of adequate staffing and poor training management of cast members.  Your marketing makes much of the Disney  Magic , but if this isn't in evidence, then families like ours will choose to go elsewhere in future   there are plenty of other theme parks to choose from these days. I shall share these experiences with people I know, including on internet forums where people discuss their holiday plans   and I await your response with interest.",0
"We only had one day in Disney so knew time would be tight. We didn't arrive until close to 11am and left to have dinner but came back for the parade. We were disappointed with the number of rides closed for upgrade or due to maintenance issues (Big Thunder Mountain, the Train, and, Autopia closed for Maintenance, then Bobsled, Watersplash, Porates of the Carribean and Indiana Jones all encountered technical difficulties while we were on them or queueing. The fireworks were cancelled due to wind and while there are a lot of trees in the area, seriously there was hardly anything at all. The Fast Pass service is under utilised and we got a ticket every two hours, sometimes sending one person off while queueing for something else to get them. Forget not doing it if the ride has a queue time of 30 minutes or less and get it whenever you can. We skipped all the queues on every ride we had a pass for and walked straight to the front. We covered a huge amount of ground this way and couldn't work out why others weren't doing it too. The magic is still there, but too many maintenance issues for the price,",0
"Went with my two sisters who were disabled. It took me 5 hours to book this holiday and two trips to travel agents.I booked through First Choice who were amazing but Disney Paris were shocking. each time First Choice called we got different advice! We got cut off several times. Firstly they said there was no adapted rooms, then the adapted rooms had no handle bars. We were told all Disney parks had bath tubs and none with showers. We finally found an adapted room but the lady on the phone from Disney Paris could not tell us if it was available unless we booked it. They could not help us with transfers so we booked a private taxi for extra cost. Then we were told to measure the wheelchair and it could not be accepted by Air France had it had to be 110cm in height, ours was 116cm. Discrimination! All this drama for no reason. when we phoned Air France they said,  do you really think we are going to refuse you because we are going to measure your wheelchair1 .The airport were great and we got to the hotel fine. The doors were not all electronic and if they were the sensors were rubbished as we got trapped in them. The Seqiou Lodge room was dull, old fashioned decor and bathroom had no fan or window. The beds were made but not changed even if they were dirty.Only one tiny lift to go downstairs to restaurant!We could book a special transfer to park which came in 10 20 mins to pick us up and was well adapted. We hired another wheelchair from the park but it was hard to find as it was disguised in shop. They wanted 150    deposit,    9 a day to hire. At City Hall we had to present a blue badge or a doctors letter to get a disabled pass .The pass was useful as we could jump queues and had special sections for parades. It was annoying how everyone kept wanting to see it when we weren't pushing them in wheelchairs for fun of it! The Studios had special seats for wheelchairs to see the shows. The railway which takes you from one end of park to another was rubbish, only one section was allocated for one wheelchair. Even then you had to physically lift it up the little step. then they wanted you to be seated around it. One station didn't have ramp exit or lift.A lot of maintenance happening at the park this year, which was a shame.We usually go in half term, it was fairly quiet in term time. The food as everyone knows was veryyyyyyyyyyyy overpriced and not much for vegetarians.Disabled toilets were located across the park. Was difficult to drive wheelchair on some parts between park, as surface uneven. Shops weren't wide enough to have wheelchair to go around.On paper it all looked good for the disabled but in reality it was very limited.I nearly lost my temper when I was asked to show my disable pass so the worker could open the door at the exit of the park to let us out.My sisters loved the experience, please go but be aware of all the things I have mentioned.",0
"First, line is horrible whenever... No exception.Sure, disney app will show how long the wait is and all.. but for me, It's not big of help. Even with Southern California pass blocked throughout the summer break, lines are pretty much endless. Secondly, food inside the park is over priced. Can of soda can cost you about 5 bucks. To eat a burger or somewhat similar, family of 4 will come out to about $40 50.I really get annoyed at people looking at their phone while walking or pushing strollers. They don't pay attention and almost run over my son few times. Disney banned  selfie sticks  due to safety issues but some people will find someways to bring them in. One Chinese tourist manage to bring one in and hit my son's forehead and made a big bump. As I was calming my son down, they ran off... What a bastards. I reported the incident to guest relations but all they said was  l'm sorry to hear that.  Not a thing said about improving security checks.. I even saw few people getting in without a valid ticket(for example, expired annual pass)...several times. These things are pretty common in Disneyland... Sadly... Only reason that I got an annual pass is to keep my son happy. But from what I have experienced, I feel like I'm wasting my money.",0
"Just after Memorial Day we took our kids ages 5 and 3 to Disney. Our trip included one day at the original Disneyland and another at California Adventure. Where to begin. First the staff does a tremendous job considering the massive size of the crowd and the nature of the rides, well other than the staff member that set off a dry ice bomb in a trash can while we were there that resulted in the evacuation of Toon Town, but other than that guy they were great. Parking is a breeze as they have a huge parking garage and numerous staff members guiding you right into your spot. At $15 to park it was one of the few costs that didn't result in sticker shock. A tram takes you from the garage to the park entrance and they have many trams running so little to no wait. As for the park itself if you really want to see everything you need two full days. We went from a little after 9:00 in the morning to a little after 9:00 at night and maybe covered 65% of the park. Also, be sure to invest in a smart phone app that provides wait time information. Very useful. As you would expect the crowds are huge. I knew that going in but one thing that did surprise me was the make up of the crowd. I assumed everyone there would be a bunch of younger kids and their parents like us but to my surprise there were many older kids and young adults. Now don't get me wrong I loved amusement parks when I was that age but my preference was more of the Six Flags varity. When I was 18 the last thing I'd wanted to do was ride the Tea Cups. So it was pretty typical while we were parking our strollers and rounding up the kids a dozen 16 19 year old girls would run right past us to ride Dumbo adding to our wait time. When it comes to the rides if you are looking for the newer themed stuff like Buzz and Woody you need to go across the way to California Adventure. Disneyland is your old school Mickey Mouse and their rides are based on classics like Alice in Wonderland and Dumbo. I will note they have added some Star Wars attractions including a pretty awesome 3D ride but other that that most of the rides are older than me. Really the key is to be patient especially if you are like me with younger kids. Everyone was organized and the staff kept things moving but plan on waiting in line a bunch. Wait times ranged anywhere from 20 minutes to an hour  for the more popular rides. Getting from point A to point B at times felt like an obstical course dodging all the people stopping to take pictures or reference their map but it was manageable. The layout is pretty simple. There is a train that goes around the park but beware it can stop running. Was it worth it? Absolutely because the kids enjoyed themselves and that is all that mattered. In retrospect maybe we should have waited a couple of years so the younger guy could ride everything but even he had a blast and enjoyed seeing all the characters more than his older brother.Just bring plenty of sunscreen and patience and you'll be OK. ",0
Visited yesterday amidst great anticipation as our last visit was two years ago and we knew there were some new attractions as well as some old ones we wanted to revisit. Checked the website not much info. Reached there day started well at new Star Wars attraction and iron man show but soon discovered attractions like mystic point supposed to be brand new down Down due to technical error and Lion king show was also closed and toy story parachute ride was also closed. Mind you these are all star attractions! How can a park charge full admission when three star attractions are closed??!! This resulted in crazy queues by mid afternoon bec each ride show you can imagine should have been able to take a few hundred people off the track at each point!!! We left by 430 after the parade bec the crowd had gotten to the point of ridiculous. Sure people can fit into the park but with major rides closed this is not fair to paying customers flying in from overseas!!! A partial discount or meal vouchers should be offered when more than one major attraction is closed. Disappointed and unlikely to come back again.,0
The park has mostly rides for children. The attractions are wonderful but the queues are horrible. You get adrenaline rush in one or two rides.,0
"Being regulars at WDW in Florida there are so many things lacking here. Biggest complaint!!! the Smoking!! why does no one enforce the designated smoking areas?? I don't understand it. This is a park that is for families which means children are every where, the smoking is absolutely repulsive and you can't get away from it, you walk into clouds of second hand smoke people are smoking in the line ups for rides, we even saw someone smoking while having his ticket scanned at the entrance!! that is our biggest complaint, Disney, you need to fix this!!! The crowd control is also lacking, WDW has this down pat, this park does not. People jumping the cues and staff oblivious to it. There also seems to be a lack of rides. We weren't even there during high season and by noon the line ups for most rides were an hour to 2 hours long and fast passes had run out for many rides within a couple of hours of opening. I was glad we had a car as we left every day around noon and went to the mall to get away from the madness and returned after or around supper time, then the line ups were much much better. I don't think we will be back to this park, we will head back to Orlando where they have it down to a science and there is much more to see and do.",0
"The place is meant to enthrall the infants, they may like it, but for the older guys who have seen a bit of places, it does not inspire the ideas so much. Expectations were huge considering the publicity and the price, but at the end of the day you may feel exhausted. The night parade is a good thing not to miss. Otherwise the rides are cheap!",0
"Bearing in mind that it is an expensive leisure activity, we were sooooo disappointed that many attractions and rides were closed, big thunder mountain, Star Wars tour, pirate ship and even King Arthur's sword!!!!!! I mean seriously!!!! Too bad...",0
"With not a vast area, Honk Kong Disneyland doesn't have enough room for everyone. I recommend you should start to play in the early morning and late afternoon if you want to enjoy fun if you would not like to wait for so long for each play",0
Took the grandkids there. As we live in Ireland we saved for over a year to be able to introduce my grandkids to an American Iconic landmark that I had visited many times growing up. I was disappointed the Haunted Mansion and Space mountain were closed. Disneyland is not cheap it costs $650 for 4 adults and 2 kids. We decided to have food at the French Market. It was tasteless and stomach cramps ensued shortly after the meal. It was $35 for two meals. I will say the availability of fresh fruit and healthy snacks was great. The prices were not bad for the snacks. Overall it was a lovely day for the grandkids and will be back next time for the California Adventure. Priceless memories were made and that was most important. ,0
"Cute, but so overpriced that it takes away from the enjoyment. I felt like I was bending over for Mickey and his friends at every turn.",0
"We wanted to love Disneyland Paris, but honestly, it is just really inferior to the Disney parks in the United States. I'm sure it's a great option for people that can not travel to the  real  Disney parks, but if you've ever been to one of those parks before, there is not way that you can compare those to Disneyland Paris.The park workers are generally disinterested and acted only partially willing to help when you had a question. (And yes, we asked in French and conversed in French as much as possible.) The park wasn't as clean as other Disney parks. People smoked everywhere, which was really unpleasant for non smokers.It was virtually impossible to find anything healthy to eat. At Disney World, you can find all sorts of salads, fresh cut fruit, whole fruit etc at the restaurants and stands throughout the park. We couldn't find anything like this while we were there. We resorted to pizza, after waiting outside of Hakuna Matata for an hour and a half past the supposed opening time...guess opening times were just a suggestion.There were SO many people who got in line without everyone in their group and then the rest of the group would push their way through to meet up the people who were furthest ahead in the line. That was quite annoying.The prices were high, of course. That's one thing that all Disney parks have in common! We enjoyed the traditional Disney rides and there were some different rides or attractions that were nice to see that were a change from the US parks. Overall, we had a nice enough day, but it just can't hold a candle to its US counterpart. Disneyland Paris was definitely missing the wow factor that you come to expect from Disney. DL Paris seems to be the little brother that everyone forgot.",0
"This May I went two days with my 10 years old daughter to Disneyland Paris. She had a lot of fun, but for me was not so good.We lost a lot of time waiting in all attraction, even the worse one had 40 50 minutes at least for not talking about the most famous (  90 minutes).There was a    pre booking system    to get fast access to the attraction but to use it you had to stay in a queue as well to get a    booked time    then get back several hours later to access the attraction so in the end was like doing a normal queue.There were a lot of restaurant and fast food in all park but the prices was quite high.Space Mountain was close both days and we didn   t saw any advice on their homepage saying anything about it.",0
"Most of the reviews I   ve read are quite accurate and the tips are excellent.We had a great time in the 35DegC heat which was really tiring. But the bad manners and rude visitors we encountered was shocking   mostly (not all) from the French which was even more tiring.It may be a culture difference but they don   t adhere to any queuing etiquette or general manners. In a queue if you leave a small space in front of you, I guarantee someone will try and sneak in and jump the queue. They don   t let the disabled or prams onto the bus first they just barge in. Smoking is banned in the park apart from some allocated smoking areas, guess what, our French visitors just smoke wherever they want including around children   soooooo rude !! The cast members staff never tell them    no smoking    etc they just carry on regardless, which is their general attitude. Most cast members appear pretty uninterested, no Disney smiles or    have a nice day attitude   . There are some great rides attractions but some are really dated. The Disney Junior show has got three acts (Handy Manny, Little Einstein   s and Winnie the Pooh) all 3 have been discontinued for about 5 years!!Utilise your fastpass wisely as the queues are very, very long. 2 hours at The Princess Pavilion   abs outrageous.Don   t let this review put your off going as we had a fab time, but just be aware it   s not as sugar coated as you   d expect it would be.",0
Its too little. Not that good. Definately choose the other hk park that os way better. If you know disney usa this one will dissapoint you,0
"It is so much smaller than the Orlando park, and the queues are longer. It is ok but not sure we'll go back with the kids even though we live here.",0
"It pains me to give this 3 stars because I am such a huge Disney fan. Having been to Disney World in Florida a number of times, as well as Disneyland in California, I have come to expect a certain type of aura or atmosphere in a Disney park. I just got a completely different vibe here. The tangibles: the bathrooms were dirty by midday there were lots of areas boarded up which were not very attractive and caused us to take really round about ways to certain rides, line control was not as good as in the states, the rides were a bit underwhelming (Indiana Jones roller coaster is almost identical to Thunder Mountain, a short distance away).The intangible: I cannot put my finger on why but every member of my family said the parks just did not have the same warmth and  magical  feel that they expected. Every cast member we came across was certainly nice, so that wasn't to blame. I just know that whenever we leave the US Disney Parks, we are always sad and look forward to coming back. This one, everyone said  one and done . ",0
"What a shame that so many rides were having maintenance   this should reflect on the admission price. Everything is majorly overpriced ......food, drinks etc. We found studios the best park with the shows etc. Glad we went for the experience, won't be going again.",0
"The place is great, perfect ambience and really well done.  However, inside there's mainly shops and very expensive (and low quality) restaurants. Please note, you can bring your food from home.  I missed more attractions, there are only a few of them.",0
We were expecting to see plenty of Disney characters walking around set against a huge castle with fireworks at the end of the day. Unfortunately none of this was true as we only saw 2 characters with a small castle hidden behind sheets and scaffolding. Add to that the gigantic lines for rides and meals and you spend very little time actually interacting with the entertainment. I can see the appeal for taking your kids but I can see there would be plenty of other options you would choose for the price you pay. ,0
"DisneyWorld Parks are so much better! I had a good time and would go again if I were in the area but if I had to choose between Disney locations   hands down, ORLANDO! Also, if you can only go to one park, choose DisneyLand over CA Adventure!",0
"This was my second time here but the first time as a parent. The children had a great time and I tried my best to not repeat my patents vacation mistakes from the past by complaining about how expensive everything is. Here it was a true challenge! In the park and in the hotels there is a price monopoly on drinks and ice cream. We easily spent 80 euros a day on soft drinks and ice cream. What we found out on our way from the resort was that the stores in the railway station was not part of the monopoly so here you can find drinks for half price!The fast pass system is very useful and well developed. The only negative thing I have to say is that the fast pass to the new Rattatoui event did not open until 12 and at 10.15 the normal line to the attraction was already 2 hours long!One thing that was a true disappointment was the service level in some facilities. The ice cream parlour on Main Street don't open until 12! And when the clock have passed 12 with almost 15 they decides to open! By then we were about 45 people queuing up. The crowd actually started to applause when they finally opened. Since we stayed in one of the Disney hotels we had park admission from 8am. We found it poor not to open the servings until 12.One of the mobile service stands suddenly decided to go on break after we had been standing in line for a while. That felt really annoying!Also the very frequent failures of some of the attractions was disturbing. Typically that would be big thunder mountain, buzz light year and space mountain 2.My total impression is that it is a too pricy great facility living on the Disney name.Greater value is legoland in Denmark or liseberg in Gothenburg.",0
Have been here multiple times and never ever experienced such crowding and hordes of people. The poor employees were trying to direct traffic by making entrance exits to various parts of the park one way   it was awful. Wait times for rides was ridiculous! Had we known we would have chosen to forego this visit. We couldn't even shop as we were directed away from Main Street in the evening.,0
"It breaks my heart to write this review as I am a Disney fanatic. We visited for our 1 year wedding anniversary and I have never met such rude staff, working in guest services of all places. We visited the services desk to enquiry about prices for another day of park tickets. The ticket desks were closed at this point. The gentleman behind the desk just pointed us in the direction of the closed ticket booth. God forbid we asked another question as we seemed to inconvenience him massively and it was too much effort to muster up any more words than    No    when we asked about the hotel availability. The staff didn   t care and used the intermittent storms and downpours to stand around chatting and yawning. We bought food from various quick service dining areas and none of it was even warm. Just overall felt really sloppy and not to Disney standards. No one cares they are clearly just doing a job to get paid and it shows in areas where it shouldn   t.",0
"Went to HK for the day, 1 day was enough. The park is smaller than disney world in Florida. I was there in Nov 2015. I can't imagine the heat in the summer. The lines to meet the characters were long, mickey was 2hrs...I did manage woody and buzz. The parades were good, but expect a lot of standing in one place to hold your spot. The rides were tamer compared to USA. I did ride the runaway train. easy coaster. space mountain was a direct copy.Good for 1 day one time.",0
"After having written about the many attractions being closed and having spent 3 days here some more info. Most of your time here is spent in queues  I would think 75% at least. Do NOT buy any dinner voucher system as restaurants never have space and you waste you money. The joker fast pass that comes with the hotel is practical, but if you want to avoid tears by kids remember it's not valid from 1 3. Food outlets are totally understaffed and none of them deserve the term fast food from a speed perspective. Disney.....not good enough",0
"Easily the most expensive place to spend money, not great value. Roughly   60 per person for one day pass. Many attractions were closed or closed early in the day meaning little return on your money. Fireworks at 8pm and it's everybody out by 8 15pm! We made a mistake coming here for the day; I hear Ocean Park is better value. This is just another Disney Park with little other than the words 'Hong Kong' making different to any other Disney Park. If you're travelling from Europe or USA and have been to another Disney Park already then give this one a miss; if you really want to go, only allow 5 hours   thats enough.",0
"You can't put a price on it... But you will definitely pay a great deal for it here. Everything is extremely over priced. I'm not totally tripping out over it... But it's kind of ridiculous ... We travelled from SC for vacation and came to Disney so my daughter could meet Minnie. Okay so no kidding... We got to the park at 1Pm visited both Parks and left by 6:30pm and the total cost with tickets for 4, meals, souvenirs etc.... We spent $1200. Kind of crazy. But we do EVERYTHING for our kids. Don't we? But this is too much. Clean the bathrooms more. Also, West Coast needs to pick up the Disney Go system that Disney World has. Much better system. Thanks for the memories. But we won't be returning. ",0
"The last time I went to Disneyland Paris is was Euro Disney nearly twenty years ago and really it was pretty much the same.A couple of things had changed that I had been looking forward to, Captain EO had just been replaced by Antman which was a bad mistake in my opinion, the Beauty and the Beast stained glass windows were now Sleeping Beauty and the crown shop in the castle had disappeared.The rides were good, waiting times were up to 45 minutes and you could get round the whole park in about the first few hours.Every gift shop stocked the same items, there were no special edition dolls or anything park specific apart from apparel plastered with Disneyland Paris and the food was expensive do the best thing to do was get a meal deal of 9 inch pizza, garlic bread, dessert and large drink for    14.99 from Bella Notte and split it as a couple.You now have to pay to have your picture with certain characters and the parade has about six floats with the only princesses being: Aurora, Snow White, Cinderella and Anna Elsa.It was a lovely day out don't get me wrong but if you want the real thing go to America.Kids love it here despite my adult whinge so don't let it out you off taking your children.",0
"there's only 1 ride for the adults   Space Mountain ( indoor roller coaster)the rest of the rides are for kids so only if you are with your family and kids or you're young at heart, then you'll enjoy the place. but make sure to stay until 9pm for the fireworks",0
Long for the good old days when you didn't have to plan it all to a the minute in order to see and do everything you want to. Not really a vacation in my mind   or my daughters when you just can't walk around and explore and do whatever suits your fancy when it suits your fancy. Went during a supposedly non busy time. Can't imaging going when it is busy. Service   particularly at restaurants   was not really up to what Disney hypes their service to be. Often felt like cattle with staff just pushing you through. Understand the need to keep things moving but where's the magic in that?,0
"We spent three days at Disneyland   California Adventure. Our first day, four of the five rides we were on broke down; We had a fast pass for the Haunted Mansion and had to wait 45 minutes in the fast pass line. We waited over half an hour for Pirates of the Caribbean and the ride shut down just as we approached the boarding area. The cast members did not offer any compensation, such as a fast pass, as is standard practice in Disney World. The parks were very crowded during the week as the 60th anniversary celebration was in progress and the park was definitely understaffed. Never got to ride Splash Mountain or Big Thunder Mountain as they were continually out of service. We had no problems on our prior visit three years ago in early June, but we were very disappointed this trip. I am giving an average rating vs. poor because the nighttime entertainment was outstanding.",0
We visited December 2014 with our son and his family. The park itself didn't disappoint but since our last visit 10 years ago it has become very very expensive particularly the restaurants which have mostly adopted a fixed price menu. For 2 adults and 2 children a meal with drinks costs at least   75 and this is a basic meal. A burger type meal for a family costs about   50. Be prepared for this the park takes advantage of its isolated location and captive market. My tip   stay at Ranch Crockett which has self catering facilities and take as much food with you as you can. Also the garage shop near to the parks car park is much cheaper than the on site shops.,0
"Added new rides and experiences like Ironman, but took away some really children friendly rides like the Buzz Lightyear. The musicals and live shows are really good, though.The bad part was the photographer for those character photo session was not too friendly, required an autograph book or any writing material from Disney even though Cinderalla was willing to sign it. Overall not really friendly for kids below 7 years old as the queue is too long for those rides suitable for them and price is insanely expensive for food and rides.",0
"We went the end of September thinking it was off season. We were wrong. It was a lot busier than we expected it to be. Lines for most of the big rides were well over 30  minutes. And the worst was the Halloween Party that we bought seperate tickets for. We were there opening night and it was so packed strollers were literally back to back in the park. We were not able to move very fast because of the crowds therefore didn't get a lot done during that event. I thought they'd sell a lesser number of tickets for the night time only event but it seems like there were 10 times more people in the park during that event than there were during the day. I didn't get to see any villains, we kept getting moved from one location to another when we were trying to find a spot to watch fireworks and needless to say, all the rides were a long wait. The Trick or Treating spots really created a major traffic jam throughout a lot of the park and it made for a frustrating night. It literally felt like they were over capacity that night. On positive notes, my 2 year old loved the park during the day and had so much fun. He loved meeting the characters and enjoyed most of the rides. I would recommend a stroller for anybody bringing kids his age though. He spent a lot of time in our double stroller that he shared with his 4 month old sister. The weather was nice during our visit. We had a portable fan running on the baby for part of the visit but it was very nice weather. ",0
"My daughter wanted to celebrate her 10th birthday at Disneyland after hearing all of her friends rave about it. I only relented after finding a sweet package deal with SW airlines AND because it was during the winter months. There was no way I would go during the summer with the sweltering heat and long lines. My kids (ages 10 and and 5) were unimpressed except with Star Tours (make sure to get the free fast pass otherwise you will wait in line forever). Speaking of the Star Tours ride, may the force (and patience) be with you if your child wants to build his her own lightsaber. After the ride as with many of the main attractions, you will end up in one of the theme stores. There is lightsaber building section which can be maddening as the instructions aren't very clear on how to build the darn thing and you have a bunch of kids pushing and shoving to get their parts. I was hoping it would be like Build a Bear where you get all the parts and they assemble it for you. Felt as if most of the rides at Disneyland was a bit outdated and stale. That being say one of the rides I did enjoy was the  It's a small world  as it was so outdated it was almost quaint. Overall impression is that the park can be a bit crowded even when we went during the non peak times. Lots of little kids and babies especially for those slower rides. We had more fun at Disneyland California Adventures. Pretty good military discount (up to six tickets) which you can purchase at any of the the ticket windows. ",0
"Having visited Disneyland Paris several times since it was opened I was looking forward to taking my two young grandsons for the first time. We were so disappointed that several of the rides that they were keen to go on were closed for refurbishment. Whilst I understand that this is necessary work I was amazed it was being done during the summer holiday season when I would have thought the park would attract lots of visitors. It certainly seemed busy whilst we were there. Add to that several rides kept breaking down and so we were unable to go on them, having got to the front of the queue on a couple of occasions. Not the experience I was hoping for, and no reply from Disney either!!!",0
"This was our third trip to Disneyland Paris (previous, magical visits in 2008 and 2009) and I'm sorry to say it will be our last. I was shocked at how 'tired' everything looked and more than a little surprised that a fair number of the rides were closed for refurbishment (during the Easter Holidays, of all times)?! The queues for the (functioning) rides were unforgivably long, with nothing to occupy the kids' time whilst we were waiting. We saw probably three Disney characters in the park during the three days we were there, (excluding those in the parade) and the children were completely disheartened by the lengths of the queues to have their photos taken with them.... needless to say we didn't bother. I didn't really see the point of the Fast Pass system as you can only really use it for one ride per day (possibly two if you can actually find more than one Fast Pass system open at any one time) and on numerous occasions, rides were suddenly closed due to faults and or malfunctions. We actually witnessed people being led down the side of 'Thunder Mountain' as their coaster had broken down halfway through the ride! Hardly the 'Magical Disney Experience' they were expecting, I'm sure. We found eating at lunchtime to be a complete nightmare. One day we actually queued, in an average burger restaurant, for over an hour, only to find the lady who had served us had got our order completely wrong, but hardly surprising considering she was having to contend with dozens of frustrated and angry customers and was clearly feeling more than a little out of her depth. I actually felt sorry for her and was more angered at Disney's utter incompetence towards basic customer requirements.I'm so very sorry to say this time our Disney experience certainly didn't meet our expectations and I won't be recommending it to anybody anytime soon. Very disappointing.",0
"My hubby, son (nearly 4 yrs old), 2 friends and their two kids (one nearly 4 yrs old and one 1.5 yr old) went to Disneyland Paris for 5 days in March.Disneyland Paris needs a serious lick of paint and modernising. 25 years old and it shows. Some of the rides have not changed at all since we first went nearly 20 years ago. And some of the rides (Dumbo, flying carpet and rockets) are basically the same ride with just different exteriors   come on Disney   get some new, better rides here!!There was certainly the Disney magic in the air and it was amazing to see my son soaking it all up and loving it but myself, hubby and our two friends were really struggling with just how rude some of the  locals  can be   they don't queue (quite frequently pushed in), they look down on you if (god forbid) your child makes a noise or can't stand still when in a long queue for a ride and never apologise if they bump into you (and yet as typical Brits, we would always say sorry even if not our fault). After the 2nd or 3rd day it really started to irritate me.I never felt like we got value for money while we were there   the majority of the shops are filled with the same  tat . What ever happened to all the lovely, collecatbles that Disney used to offer? The main shops are all full with the same soft toys or plastic toys, all made in China. Once you've been in one shop then you've kind of seen it all.If you want the nice stuff you need to look into the smaller boutique shops but be prepared to pay a small fortune. There is, however, a Christmas shop that is now open all year round for baubles etc. Although looking closely at some of the baubles (again, made in China) the paint finish is awful and sooo not worth the money. I didn;t see any that were less than    8 per bauble.We stayed at the Newport Bay Club Hotel which was a short walk to and from the park. Never used the busses.On our first day, upon leaving the park, we walked almost a whole mile in the wrong direction (we thought we were heading to the hotel) before heading back into the park and asking a security guy (who grunted and pointed in a direction) to show us the way to the hotels   the lack of signage or information is shocking and I would expect more from Disney. More signs needed to guide people to the hotels please!!Be prepared to queue queue and queue some more. To be fair, when we went the queues weren't too bad but just be prepared if travelling with small kids   its a lot to expect them to stand and behave in a queue for so long. Last time we went, nearly 20 yrs ago, the characters could be found all round the park and you could just walk up, take your photo and carry on with your day but now there are designated areas for characters and specific times when they'll be there....and long queues! Then you feel rushed to have your pic taken.We also opted for the photo pass but were very disappointed that hardly any of the characters actually had someone from Disney with a camera   so that was a complete waste of money! Our biggest downer of the holiday was Eurostar at Disney end   so unorganised. Chaos does not even cover it! Again, lack of signage and no one there to offer any help or guidance. Be prepared for absolute chaos.All in all, Disney is Disney and it is magical but if they could just update it and sort out the issues at the Eurostar terminal it would make it much better.",0
"We booked our trip last minute and scrambled to make dining reservations to ensure we could view the World of Colour which we had heard was a must see. We obtained a dinner reservation at Carthay Circle with tickets to World of Colour. Service was terrible! There were the only table occupied in the back dining room and a second group of 20 somethings arrived and were seated next to us. We have already placed our order and had received our starters. As soon as these other guests people from the kitchen rushed out to talk to them, arguments ensued of wine pairings, and generally a noisy ruckus next to us. They received appetizers, salads, entrees and were ordering dessert before we got our entree. We had ordered steaks and they were luke warm certainly not up to the typical standard of Disney. Our server never returned to our table to see if we enjoying our meal or if we needed anything, so we ate cold steak. Once we were done she came back and served our dessert. I know the server was not happy that we did not order alcoholic beverages just by the expression on her face (low bill low tip) so she pretty much abandoned us. The price of the meal exceeded the quality by a long shot. When we were presented with out tickets after paying our bill we were told we would be seated in the best area close to the front. Yay! Arrived early to ensure the little one could watch without having to look over or around adults and were held behind a rope and told that we had to have purchased a ticket for $150.00 each to be seated near the front. Really   What a surprize after paying $185.00 for our dinner and we see all these people moving into the seats we were told would be ours. There were a few park benches placed in our section at the back but once they dropped the rope we were told that these were not for us but for people who really needed them (meaning they paid more money to seating). So we stood on hard concrete for another hour before the show started. This is just another example of how Disney Corporation has put greed before their customers. Certainly not the Disney in the past. No more happy greetings or smiles on the faces of the people working there. So sad. So save your money, get a fast pass and you will likely have a better view than we did after spending a whole lot of money for a mediocre meal.",0
We were expecting a much bigger park then what we saw. Whilst the park was good it could be viewed in 5 hours at most. Ok for the kids bit I certainly wouldn't make it the basis of a trip to Hong Kong.,0
"Beautiful parks and great shopping. I love all things Disney but my family was disappointed with DL. We have been to Disney World several times and there is really no comparison. Disney World wins hands down   every time. DL is small, park entry is a nightmare. We went for early entry. Got to the parking area at 6:15 for the 7 am opening. Parking did not open until 6:40. Once we got parked, the tram took 10 minutes to pick us up and we were on the first tram. Then the security lines were a nightmare, not enough lines open causing a huge back up. Then we had to get in lines for the actual park   again what a mess. Slow, slow slow. It was 7:45 before we actually got into the park   so much for the early entry. We had 3 day tickets but only went 2. No need to go back anytime soon. Disney World is the way to go!",0
"If you've been to the USA Disney parks then you will almost certainly be disappointed with Disneyland Paris. Although a lot of the rides are improved versions of the USA ones, the staff are not as welcoming as in the USA and the place just does not have the same atmosphere. There is a distinct lack of 'Disney Magic' which is present in the American Parks. People smoke anywhere and everywhere, including in lines for young kids' rides like Peter Pan. It is a very expensive holiday and with the high cost of food I would consider paying a bit more and go to somewhere like Florida.",0
"As part of my spare sat in Hong Kong it was recommended me to visit this attraction. It is verte well kept up to Disney standards. I recommend to attend of travellinf with chisten,0 as the attractions are focused in kids not in adults.",0
"This was our 2nd trip to Disneyland with out two children. The first trip was 3 years ago when our kids were 7 years old, in July   poor decision. It was super hot and the lines wait times were ridiculous.We decided to do a Disney Do Over. Now that our kids are 10 years old we thought this would be a more reasonable age for them to go and enjoy all that is Disney. We opted to go in February this time thinking it would be far less hot and far less people.The temperature was definitely better although apparently it rains far more than Californians let on. No biggie, we are from Victoria so a little rain is just a regular day for us. The lines were decent without ridiculous line ups like we had experienced when visiting in the summer. Our only gripe was the amount of times rides broke down! Omg. We went on the haunted mansion 5 times and it broke down every single time. Space mountain broke down twice, Alice in wonderland ride was closed for basically 2 days, big thunder mountain broke down, mad hatter tea cups was closed (not scheduled refurbs). Maybe we just had bad luck as it seemed like every time we headed for a ride it was either broken down and closed or broke down while we were on it.Also pirates of the Caribbean was closed the entire 5 days for refurbishments and Matterhorn bobsleds was closed for refurb on day 2 for the remainder of our 5 days.We were aware of this prior to visiting but it still sucked.We were there Friday   Tuesday and Friday night, Saturday and Sunday were extremely busy (summertime busy) but Friday during the day, Monday and Tuesday were amazing with barely any wait times. We had 1 magic morning which we took advantage of (only good for Thursdays, Saturdays and Tuesdays) on the Tuesday (our last day) and were shocked to learn the Magic Morning is only good for rides in Tomorrowland & Fantasyland   Silly us, we thought it was good for the whole park and we tried to head for Indiana Jones ...The park is definitely overpriced in my opinion. Our 5 day park hopper tickets were like $1200 USD which seems pretty out of reach for the average family. Overall visiting Disney in February was great for less people, shorter lines wait times and mild temperatures but not the best for having the  fun  rides all operating and seemed a lot broke down this visit and the ticket cost is the same.",0
"What a let down! The worst visit to this park since it opened and there have been plenty. I have been to all existing Disney parks   California, Florida, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Paris. Having been and enjoyed a birthday tea party four years ago it would have been nice to do the same again but they have stopped doing the tea party and only have on offer more expensive options which are too expensive when travelling as a family of 8. Let's hope the new park in China will be better when it opens in a couple of years.",0
"Unfortunately our experience to Disney was not as good as some. We travelled with two children, the younger one being a huge disney fan. The queues were very long, which really was no problem, the rides very short. There was not a single Disney character walking around. We were hoping at least to see one. Only one restaurant was open for lunch, (other small snack area's open) over an hour in queue just to place our order. Still we were not discouraged  we were at Disney  and our children did enjoy themselves, but for me very overpriced for what you get!",0
"This was my first visit to Disneyland Park and I was really looking forward to it. Every ride that I was anxiously looking forward to ended up being just OK. On my very first ride, the Pirates of the Caribbean, when you first start out in the boat you can see people dining to your right. The boat lingered there for a little bit, I'm assuming to allow the boat that was ahead of us to have a head start on their course. While we were waiting, a passenger on our boat told the story of how a child jumped out of the boat where we were because she was scared and I believed she severed her legs and later died. It was very sad and I was already a bit nervous. I didn't need to overhear that. Whenever we wanted to find an employee with a Disneyland uniform they were hard to locate. When I visited the ladies room, I was expecting employees be there constantly keeping it clean like they do at Universal Studios. I attribute my experience to one reviewer   s comment that the quality of Disneyland has declined over time. I believe there could've been a time in the past where my visit to Disneyland would've been truly magical, but maybe that time has passed. I had more pleasure in just walking around and looking.",0
"Small rides, without too much imagination or thrill factor. The Disney characters are hard to find when walking around, in fact no characters were walking around the crowds like we have seen elsewhere.  Easy to get to using the MTR",0
wow man what an time hahaha hahaha seriously lol u gotta see this place hahahha foreal,0
"It was nice to go once, but I've had my Disneyland experience and am happy to not return. The lines for the rides are ridiculous, even if you get the express pass you schedule for hours later to ride a given ride. Disney Adventure Park was a nicer park and the food was actually pretty good, especially at the Cone Motel.",0
"We brought tickets before we left and got 2 days for less than the price of 1. After visiting would advise everyone to look for an online deal not worth the walk up price. Castle was closed due to that area being refurbished and altered, weekday aprox no more than a 30 min wait for rides with most being less than that would not recommend weekends or holidays. As has been said like all Disney parks and theme parks in general food and drink is expensive .This is a small park and can easily be done in 1 day",0
"Loved loved the parade   granddaughters favourite bitLoved the fireworksAll the characters are so nice to the kidsRides are good and they do keep you moving on mostHate queuing with a vengeanceFood prices exhorbitant and the same all overSat night you need to book somewhere to eat or you end up at Buzz Lightyears were food was fine but not used to eating with paper plates,plastic cutlery,garden metal chairs,picnic tables and all you can eat buffet in a dome with no windows.Still could have been worse........food could have been badThink there should be more seating areas around as the park as tiring.Seriously loved seeing my granddaughters face and would not have missed it but would not go again.",0
It is good for small kids to use rides and see and meet Disney Characters ! Kids 10  will see no excitement in Rides as there are very few exciting rides for Young ones ! One who have visited Universal Studio will definitely feel bore...More,0
If you are traveling in a peak time don't try to see Disney land. Try and see the other attractions California offers.My family spent our vacation struggling with long lineups and crowds at Disney and it wrecked our vacation. I think the ability to buy a season pass has too many locals coming to the park at peak times.,0
"Being American and a former Disney employee I have had many Disney experiences. We enjoyed our time at Disneyland Paris and the kids had a good time so just a few comments.The fast pass is awesome   use it wisely and you won't wait in a line all day. Immediately go to the ride you want that has a fast pass, if no line or a short line, get the fast pass and then stand in the short line   that way you get to go twice. Get there early, right when the park opens and then go on the busiest rides first (Crush's Coaster, Rock and Roll Roller Coaster and Tower of Terror at the studios). This way you can get them out of the way and enjoy them without a long line. From experience, you can usually do 2 3 rides in the first hour with very little wait. Also, as soon as you can get another fast pass go get it. At the US parks there are very clearly designated smoking areas   perhaps they have them in Disneyland Paris but no one smokes there. It was overwhelming. People holding their babies smoking, smoking in the queues, restaurants, bathrooms, everywhere... the staff did not direct people elsewhere to smoke. This was disappointing. I am appreciative of differences when we travel but people blowing smoke in your children's faces is not cool.",0
This disneyland is perhaps the smallest one in Dinsy Park family and doesn't match up to the high standards and expereince of other Disney Parks around the world. The park is quite small and can be covered in 3 hours flat. Not many interesting rides or theaters. Even the park merchandise is sub par. I would not recommend this park,0
"This park was very expensive for a few big rides. i do not reccomend you come, but you if you do you should ride the california screamin. The Embassy suites was a great hotel down the street that i recomend you stay at if you are from out of town.",0
"My one year passport expired and I cannot tell you how much I hate Disneyland after this experience.So many people no matter what day you go, food is very expensive, and no new rides in years. They are putting all their money into star wars for next summer. They even pulled out the professional photographers out of the princess areas yet I paid extra for that feature on my pass for my autistic son. They stopped about 2 months ago providing that service so I am done with Disney not that they care.",0
"If you have been to Disney in Orlando don't bother going to Disneyland you will be disappointed.Took us 1.5 hrs to park, pass security and buy tickets. There are lineups everywhere, it was not fun. We did not enjoy ourselves.Additionally the staff was not friendly and seemed very unhappy.Getting out of the park was another nightmare altogether.",0
"Now I'm a huge fan of Disneyland in Anaheim, but it's hard to compare. HK Disneyland is much smaller and somehow lacks a little charisma like in California. Certainly worth an afternoon outing, but it could be better.",0
"We visited Disneyland on Thursday 21st Feb for a few days. We had booked the trip quite late and hadn't pre booked any park tickets! Standing in the queue, we worked out that for a 2 day 2 park ticket for me, my husband and our 8 year old daughter was going to cost 374   ! If possible, try and sort out a deal before you go!The park is very expensive, anything and everything costs a lot of money! We made sandwiches at breakfast at our hotel(!) and took those with us, saving us a fair bit of money. Hot drinks are about 3.20    and as the weather was freezing, we must have spent a fortune trying to warm up! Despite all this, our daughter thought it was fantastic! She was able to go on most rides, she wasn't quite tall enough for the Indiana Jones ride (1.40m). The parade was great, just try and get a good viewing point early. We didn't stay for the park closing show as we were too cold! All in all, we enjoyed ourselves because our daughter had a fantastic time. However, I don't think we would go again as 1) I feel we managed to do it all in two days and 2) we will need to take out a second mortgage!",0
"I decided to do both parks while I was there for the Run Disney Weekend. This is my review for the Park (Studio was great).I wish I hadn't book a 2 park ticket. I only managed to get on one ride and that was the Pirates of the Caribbean. The waiting times for the other rides were out of this world! So much so, I gave up and went back to my hotel. The Single Rider queues were full of families. Parents were leaving their children alone in the queue! The only time I saw staff remove families from the single rider queues was in at the Studios.People had no respect for others. Queue jumping was rife! Staff did make an attempt to prevent this and send people to the back of the queue but as soon as they turned their backs, away these dreadful people went.And the smoking! I thought maybe smoking was allowed, being a non smoker I'm not too sure about the rules in each country... until I walked pass a smoking area.Positive   the staff were friendly. I found that if you did behave yourself in the queues you were treated with more respect. At Pirates I somehow got on the ride before the family that pushed in front on me as we were nearing the front. Quite frankly, I don't know how staff maintained their patience with most of the customers.",0
"First off, I'm a huge Disneyland fanatic. I live out of state and only have managed to go about 9xs (not enough!). However, this trip Oct 9 Oct 11 was one of the least pleasant visits we ever had. We have been to DL on 3 major holidays and we never have seen it as packed as we did during this visit. I mean shoulder to shoulder crowds, 20 min to get from New Orleans to Frontierland, can't put your kid down without him getting stepped on, packed! All rides were 45 min to over 2 hours wait. Fastpasses were gone by 12pm. We went about 45 min before the park opened at 8am and we didn't get in until 10am! Parking was a nightmare as well as the security checkpoint. I heard that since DL has made annual passes more accessible, the crowds have been too difficult to deal with. And I feel this takes away from the whole magic of the park. We spend thousands of dollars to go wait in line for over an hour for a ride, 20 min for a churro, what kid wants to do that? We couldn't ride the Tower of Terror for the last time due to only one elevator running and the over 2 hour wait (no fast passes). Radiator Springs racers also had a 2 hour wait but we beelined one morning and made it with only a 20 min wait. Don't even go into Tomorrowland, you can't push a stroller through. It makes you wonder what would happen in a disaster, how many people would get stomped on? Now the good... DL sure treats you right. We were 2 hours late to our Character dining at the Plaza Inn with Minnie (security lines) and they still managed to squeeze us in. Also, the travel agency we used didn't send the e voucher on time and DL gave us 4 complementary 1 day park hoppers no questions asked! Amazing! (we resolved the problem later) Let's talk about World of Color. That show made the entire trip worth it! It was so amazing I even got emotional watching it. We got fast passes when we did that beeline to Radiator Springs Racers and they are so worth it since you watch from the front row. This is a must see in your life. Mickeys Soundsational Parade was also amazing and a nice break from the hectic day. My toddler fell for Tiana! Another thing we noticed is that there were characters everywhere and at all times. We had never seen this before. Out of the 9 previous visits we had never ever seen Mickey Mouse. We saw him 4 times! And finally Radiator Springs. Oh my goodness! It's a trip straight into the movie! Very well done Disney! 5 stars for Cars Land! Oh we also noticed that food in CA Adventures is significantly cheaper than DL. Plus they have alcohol (Rita's Margaritas anyone?) We enjoyed our time at CA Adventures more than DL in the end. I hope DL fixes this crowed mess, I doubt it since they are rolling in the dough. ",0
"Having visited disneyworld Florida many times we were expecting a great couple of days, we were to be very disappointed. We were redirected to a car park at the outer edge of downtown disney and basically left to find our own way to the park which was a extremely long walk. The fact that disney knew we were being redirected as they were waiting ready to take the $16 parking fee they should have laid transport on to the park. The park was chaos, we put a fast pass in and it came up for 6 hours later so stopped us from using it again. I asked a assistant in one of the shops about a item and she said she would find out and then just left me. Splash Mountain was shut all day. Basically they just let to many people into the park on both days we went. It's expensive and we expected better",0
"A nice to do when visiting HK with kids. Don't expect much. This is a small version of Disney Paris and a fraction of Disney world. Expect lost of crowd during weekend, with Chinese fellow visiting over",0
Just returning from dlp and hugely disappointed in the amount of closed and broken attractions. Check the website to see the list but pretty much most of frontier land and adventure land is boarded up for attractions under long term refurbishment and repair I simply don't understand how they can schedule so much closure at the same time in the middle of summer ( I know there is no down time for the park but it felt as if half the park were closed ). Also while we were there this week. Phantom mansion Peter Pan and pirates of the Caribbean were all closed at various times because of failures. There was a big crane over the castle today while people repaired  cleaned inspected it   in the middle of the day !!) I don't know if they reduced the number of visitors to compensate but it didn't feel like it   felt like same number of people queuing for less things   longer queues The rides that were working continue to be terrific and the parades are delightful and the whole crazy sweaty hysterical money grabbing machine continues to be unmistakably Disney and we all know we are going to go there whatever the reviews   but I am surprised at how poor the attitude or ideal of paris is compared to the spiritual home at Florida I wish I saved my money and showed my young son Disney at its best in the U.S. .,0
"I took my 2 children for a day at Euro Disney and i was glad i only booked the day! I was expecting the WOW factor but i didn't get it! The queues for the rides were over an hour long, people were queue jumping, the rides were a good walk, and not that good when you went on them ( have to admit, i didn't go on many  thrill  rides) .My children aged 4 & 6 were asking to go home after 2 hour. I had to get them a pushchair (15 Euro!!!!) as the rides were far apart. We had Walt Disney studio tickets too, which was no good for small children as most of it was the cinema side so def wouldn't have paid for that side knowing what i know now. If you like Alton Towers, then you will like Euro Disney, although personally, i think Alton Towers is better. It's very American with so many over priced shops too.The plus side, we had a blue badge as we went with my disabled friend, it said we would need a doctors note to get passes, but at 4pm, fed up and ready for home, i went and asked and they gave me a fast pass in 5 mins, this was the highlight of the day and we went on 10 rides in the next 5 hours. I was also told that food was really expensive...i don't agree, we had 2 meal deals which consisted of 2 pizza's, garlic bread, salad, 1 ice cream, 1 fruit bowl and 2 drinks which cost just over   20, so not too bad. It was microwave pizza though. The staff were fab and very dedicated, all were very good. The parade i thought was average but my 6 year old girl was mesmerized and loved it. We didn't watch the fireworks as they didnt start till gone 11pm which is not much good for smaller children, i think 10 would have been better. All in all a very average day.",0
"After visiting Disney World, Disneyland just can't compare. The cast members were not nearly as friendly  almost overly zealous to keep order and dispense rules. The food at the Barbecue area (chicken and ribs)was overpriced and poor. In addition, we had to sit through a very hokey vocal performance during lunch. While the longest line was 40 minutes, most of the rides were disappointing, especially the race cars, Tiki Room and Nemo. We did enjoy The Matterhorn, Thunder Mt. Railroad, and Indiana Jones rides. I would recommend a trip to Orlando to Disney's other parks, like Epcot, for adults without children. ",0
"Sorry to say but HK Disneyland was a disappointment.  So small, with hardly 3 Zones, Frontier Land, Tomorrow Land, and the kiddie one.  Even the train around the park has two stops.    I have been to Euro Disney twice which is much better.   As a...More",0
"Spoiler Alert! Don't read this if you want to be surprised; the tour info purposely doesn't give you much details so you'll be surprised. It costs $80 apiece, starts at dusk and lasts 2 1 2 hours. You get a few sweet treats from the candy kitchen, a pretend  ghost  from the Haunted Mansion that comes along with you and your tour guide. What they don't tell you is you get on rides attractions without standing in lines. They're the Haunted Mansion, Big Thunder Railroad, Mr. Toad's Wild Ride and Space Mountain. Had we known this we wouldn't have stood in lines earlier for the big rides.",0
"Have been here around 8 10 times with my family. Quite an expensive day out but if you're into all the rides there are plenty of them. Have put in place more security measures but what a nightmare! They have a 'no bags' line which was empty, so security were letting lots of people cut through this lane even though they had bags so then they were putting their bags through the security processes in other queues, making them a much longer wait time. Very disorganised and a lengthy process!!!! Very clean park, lots of eating places.",0
Please realize that this park is only 60% of Orlando and yet there are 18 million within an hour of this park as opposed to only 5 million for Orlando.... VERY crowded but that is capitalism. Love my shares in Disney... PAC EM in!!!,0
"Fun & exciting park.  Absolutely magical.   Admission price to park is way too expensive plus pay to park.   Food, beverages, mementos in gift shops, pix on rides    all overpriced.",0
"First, we had a great three day visit at Disney. The kids will always love it. However, it was my first time in a Disney overseas and I was really surprised that they don't maintain the famous Disney quality. The buildings had paint peeling, the bathrooms were atrocious. trash was all over the grass and walkways and the service was rude. There is no way this would be tolerated in an American Disney resort. It takes away from the magic of the place to see things so dirty and to encounter so many surly  cast members . That said, the rides are fun and there are the old favorites plus some new fun ones. We would go back, but I think Walt would turn over in his grave to see how they have let his standards slip.",0
I have visited DisneyWorld in Florida many times and in my opinion; Disneyland does not compare. Disneyland is much smaller with long lines to mostly all of the attractions. We visited mid week before the spring break crowds in March. The attractions are not as nice in most cases as those in DisneyWorld but if you have never been to DisneyWorld you will probably love your visit to Disneyland if you can go during a time when it is less crowded.,0
"Likes:The train to Disneyland is really a big WOW to all the kids. Even myself was delighted to see the mickey mouse theme train.It's so lively to have a ride on this mickey mouse train.Disneyland:The souvenirs in all the shops are replica. Nothing special and quite costly.The rides are awesome. But Q is duper long, waited almost an hour.Dislikes:Overcrowded, hardly can overtake the person infront of you.",0
"We used to live in SoCal and we had park passes for years. It was so fun to go to the parks for however long or short a time we wanted. If it was too crowded we would go play at the playground in DCA or hang out on Tom Sawyer's island.We've lived outside of SoCal for 11 years and decided to drop into the parks before visiting family. We had one day; the day before Thanksgiving. We anticipated crowds but we know these parks very well so we weren't worried. We got one day hopper passes. We were in DCA by 8am and went straight to Radiator Springs FastPass. We got a 10:20am time. *Helpful hint* The single rider line of this ride moves even faster than the FastPass line but since it was our first time on this ride we wanted to sit together.The FastPasses you get are tied to your park ticket so you must scan your park ticket in the FastPass line, not the actual FastPass.What used to be Soarin' over California is now Soarin' over the World and it.is.amazing!!!!!!!!!!!! This was one of my favorite rides anyway and they made it even better!!!!!!!DCA has always been my preferred park. More open space, more play areas for kids, usually less crowded. A better lay out I feel and better food! I don't love that alcohol is served in DCA but there's nothing I can do about that. I'm pretty sure the only place alcohol is served in DL is in Club 33.We caught the noon Frozen performance at the Hyperion in DCA. It was a wonderful break from the heat and standing walking. We did spend time in DL. It was way more crowded and I'm not a big fan of DL but again, we know the park well and we were able to do in 14hrs more than anyone would expect.The fireworks show was cancelled due to winds (this happens more than people realize) which was disappointing because the holiday fireworks show is the best.Big Thunder Mountain is a favorite of ours too and they've upgraded the thunder tunnel which was a delightful surprise! This is the smoothest, most enjoyable ride ever.Our teen was able to use the single rider line on Splash Mountain and Space Mountain. Single Rider options are life saving sometimes!I got my Dole Whip at the Tiki Bar *helpful hint* go into the Tiki Room waiting area and order from that side of the bar. There was a line of at least 30 people waiting in the  street  side of the bar and I walked into the holding area and no one was in line so I was in and out with my Dole Whip in a matter of seconds. Dole Whips are NON DAIRY!!!!!!!!!!!!! Yes, I love them.Overall a great experience for our teen who hadn't been since he was 5 years old. He was grateful for parents who knew the park, he was amazed at how the parks transport you to other times and places through the themes and d  cor. We spent 14 straight hours in the parks which was exhausting and we've never done that before but when you only have one day it's what you do.We blew over $100 on food and snacks and drinks. You ARE allowed to bring food and drink into the parks and we did but it wasn't enough. We utilized every drinking fountain we saw to refill water bottles.I don't know how families afford Disney experiences but the place is always packed. Stay for at least 3 days if you can and read a guide book to understand FastPasses, rider switch (a must for parents of small children), and single rider options.As much as I am NOT a fan of Disney, I admit to the magic that can be felt in the parks. And be warned that even though it is  The Happiest Place on Earth  you will see a LOT of meltdowns and unhappy people, ha ha!",0
"Don't bother out of season as 40% of the restaurants, rides and amusements aren't available. Looks like the whole thing could do with a lick of paint but staff are wonderful and really get in to the magic.",0
disney is disney as we all know. the lines are long and excruciating. they offer a fast pass. but be advised to research this process before thinking its going to help you out. you must plan hours ahead of when you want to go on these rides. to use the fast pass. with research it may be better.. ill take this one on operator error.. but kids had a blast of course it is still disney land.. drinks and food werent as pricy as we had prepared for so that was a nice surprise.,0
"We were anticipating a great day, but the queues were huge (although this was expected). We didn't take the express passes, but we managed to skip the lines on a few attractions as single riders. Compared to the Florida parks that we have visited on this holiday (Disney, Universal and Aquatica) the park looks very dated to the Florida parks. What really ticked us off was that no less that SIX attractions were closed. Yes SIX. We felt ripped off that we have paid full price for what is substantially less than a fully operational park. It's obvious that they need to update, but six attractions at the same time? Please! Beware if you are visiting soon! In comparison to other parks that we have visited the food and drinks are expensive. Overall as much as we did enjoy what we did the fact that so many attractions were closed left us more than a little underwhelmed and disappointed.",0
"I've been to Disneyland Paris for the first time, and was a bit disappointed. Several rides were closed for maintenance, and the whole park was small and crowded. I've only managed to get on one ride. Not the best place for young adults, since the park is mostly meant for children. I've been to Disneyland in California, and that was  the real deal!  Disneyland Paris is quite amateur in comparison. ",0
Same as Disney studios there are alot of rides were closed for refurbishment so check on the website before your reservation.  Tip: please don't by the tickets from the gate it will be double price more by it online at least 24 hrs before,0
"Travelled all the way from Australia to go here and they had Mickeys holloween party so we couldnt go in and see the fireworks and night time parade, so walked around and looked and went to go back on the thursday night YOU guess it another hollowen party so we werent allowed in again, so needless to say we arent impressed with disneyland. one would think we would of been told about this special event when we purchased our tickets...yes i am 51 and i would of liked a picture with mickey but was told a i had to come back in an hour and the 3 kids behind me got their picture taken, so i wasnt real impressed seeing i grew up with all the mickey mouse club etc....",0
"We really like Disney...but, during our visit (Jan 4, 5, 6) the major rides shut down every day...Space Mountain, Matterhorn, Indiana Jones, Thunder Mountain and others...so, how is it that we pay a premium to go to Disneyland to receive bad service...My advice is to avoid Disney until they figure out how to maintain their rides. ",0
"Having visited Disneyland and Disney world in the United States I was quite disappointed in Disneyland Paris. The cast members are not friendly and they are not very helpful at all. The entire park can be done in about 3 hours. The food prices are even more expensive than the other parks and we went specifically to see the Christmas decorations and even that was disappointing. Space mountain was broken down and the hours are so short 10am to 7pm. I could never imagine what on earth people with young children do to entertain them after 7pm? They also don   t sell, nor have ever heard of Micky Mouse ears? How can that be?? We did take the train from Gare de Lyon to the last stop and we were right at the entrance of the park. The train ride was about 20 minutes. ",0
Disney in March is just too busy! Waiting 70 minutes or more for a ride is just not for me. I will never go back after enduring the crowds we dealt with. I know its more than rides but its not enough to bring me back. I thought the food was poor. We went on a Monday and Tuesday. Can't imagine the weekends. For 600 plus dollars for a family of 4 for 2 days it was too much to fight the crowds.,0
"We've just returned from Euro Disney which was our 4th trip there over the past nine years. We bought four tickets for the Hallowe'en night party which were a complete waste of money as the queues for rides extended to two hours so we got on very few rides. The night was made worse by the behaviour of gangs of North Africans pushing in on rides that my daughter and her friend were queueing for. They also harrassed them by coming up to their face and learing, they have no idea how to behave. One spat during the Space Mountain ride which landed on my daughter's friends face. The youth got off bragging about it. There are no staff monitoring the queues so all this behaviour goes unchecked. The gangs also frequent the Village at night most noticeably at weekends and bank holidays. We have never experienced anything like it in the Florida parks. Normality resumed after the weekend and the park crowds thinned out and families could wander happily once more. We stayed at the Radisson Blu, the first time we have chosen to not stay in a Disney hotel in Paris. What an oasis of calm. Lovely hotel with a reliable shuttle every half hour and very pleasant staff. The last thing I'll comment on is the price of everything. Food and drink prices are shockingly high so be warned. A family of four would need   100   150 per day to cover lunch and dinner, and that's eating on a budget!",0
"If you've visited Disney in Florida or Paris, Hong Kong Disney is a much smaller version, and does not have many good rides. Good rides to me are roller coasters, Alton Towers Thorpe Park (UK) standard. I went to Florida when a child, and the Paris a few years ago in my 20's and loved both.If you are doing a stop over flight in Hong Kong and you have a spare half day, with children, then its worth going to. The parade was good, space mountain, and the runaway train were good rides for semi thrill seekers, but I felt that the local visitors preferred to go there to take pictures and queue for half an hour to see each Disney character rather than go on the rides. As per many attractions the food was quite expensive but they did have a number of restaurants to choose from varying in price. The park was easy to get to on the MTR (underground) I would suggest all those going there travel by this way as they have a Disney train which is great. You need to travel on the Tung Chung line to Sunny Bay, and then its one stop from there. It is very close to the International airport also.One thing I also noted was that the rides are not catered for tall people, so if you are over 6ft tall, good luck fitting in some of the rides!",0
"As it says I've been here 3 times and this was the worst yet. The level of ride closures, for peak season, was ridiculous (Star tours, thunder mountain, adventure island etc, etc) combine this with hoardings and cranes at Cinderella's castle and you truly have an unmagical experience. The money machine that is Disney really don't give a toss hence non reduction in entry fees. To be fair my daughter really did enjoy herself otherwise I'd have rated this place as terrible",0
"The park it self is good consisting of five parts (or worlds), each with its own theme, two main rides per world plus an additional 2 3 smaller rides, so plenty for everyone. This park certainly offers more value than its counterpart, Studios. Same cons however, poor food priced extortionatly, some parts of the park needing a bit of maintenance and once again rude park staff. Again, very disappointing that so many smokers are freely walking around polluting the airspace in every section of the park. Given this is geared up for kids it's a complete joke. Train the staff in some customer relations, given us tourist are paying their wages and put a bit of the profits back into the park and please introduce a smoking section, out of sight from the kids and the customers experience would be so much better.",0
Disneyland is an amazing place. And when you enter for the first time you   re mind is blown away. The whole scene and atmosphere is amazing. At highly recommend. But as an amusement park. I am not impressed. Several of the larger rides was closed. The lines where huge for everything. You use half the day in lines. We had tickets to both parks. Be aware that Disney studios closes at 19:00. ,0
"My husband and I decided to make a trip to Disneyland (October 17 22) to check out the new updated attractions since our last trip to the park was in 2008. We thought October would be a great time to avoid crowds. Boy were we wrong. The crowds were horrible. Even with Fast Pass the crowds frustrated both my husband and I. We enjoyed the revised Star Tours but did not like the Halloween themed Space Mountain or the Haunted Mansion. It seemed many of the rides kept breaking down while we were there (i.e. Space Mountain, Matterhorn). I was very disappointed that the Indy ride was closed and the current condition of It's a Small World. That ride needs an overhaul. Overall my husband and I enjoyed the fireworks. ",0
"Just back... had a great time ... we obviously knew about the refurbishments but boil it back and there isn't much in the way of rides ... magic hours was packed so go early and use the 8:00 08:30 slot wisely as after this the rides that are open early are busier than after 10:00 ... in order we did Pinocchio, Dumbo, Peter Pan, Teacups and Carrousel in 25 mins from 8am... then waited to be first into Frontierland but watch out for a crush to get on Big Thunder Mountain... very scary, the crush not the ride. Parade good we got decent slot on main square curb by waiting from 30mins beforehand. Indiana Jones is the best ride to fastpass. ",0
"If you have visited orlando, paris, tokyo, hong kong.....I don't think anaheim has much to add. I don't subscribe to this 'it was Walt's park'....It is smaller than any other disney park, very few original attractions thanks to cloning and californians are savy navigators and the majority of visitors, so you feel that everyone knows the game and you didn't read the rules....Great rides, but can't compare to the escape of orlando",0
"Having spent over 70 days in Disney Parks around the world, we went to Paris to celebrate our Grandson's 18th birthday and what a disappointment. Arrive at Florida Park and cast members welcome you and the magic starts in the car park. In Paris at 9.20am on a Saturday, we did not see a cast member until we had found our own way in and were going down Main Street. There are two big rides closed for refurbishment plus the runaway train broke down almost all day and then the Peter Pan ride. This left huge queues for every ride and again, no cast members anywhere. Even It's a Small World ride had 50 minute queues, the longest I have ever seen for this ride in any park. As it was the first weekend of Halloween, there were very few shows, but two parades so from about 7 pm until the fireworks at 10 pm, the only thing to do was queue.All eating outlets closed early and the only small cafe in Main Street had one person serving, so again 40 minutes wait. Our whole family was very disappointed, well below the standard of other Disney Parks and we will not be returning. Save for longer and go to Florida and love the Magic!",0
"Disney is always a good idea, especially when celebrating a joint birthday. Overall we had a lovely time, however compared to other Disney parks, Orlando and California, this park is missing that 'extra magic'.Whereas the majority of cast members were friendly, there were a higher percentage of times where cast members were unpleasant and didn   t project the Disney look. Main issues we experienced:Hello   goodbye   when entering the park, it is common curtsy to welcome and say goodbye to guests. Over the duration of our stay I think we only got welcomed once during the whole time. Many of the cast members seemed moody and unapproachable. It was as if they didn   t care. Park cleanliness   the litter in the trash cans (especially in the attraction lines) were over filled and spilling onto the floor, again not the Disney look. Some trash cans had ripped stickers, chipped paint and generally lacked the high Disney standards as seen in other parks. Quick service   When placing an order the Cast members weren't friendly. Over the course of the 3 days no one once said please or thank you, very unfriendly or polite. Smoking 'everywhere'   Although Disney has designated smoking areas, many of the guest seem to smoke wherever they liked. I have never experienced this in any other Disney park and found it highly annoying. We saw a number of Cast members walk past them but fail to approach or ask them to not smoke. Again, it was like they didn   t care. Overall   the park is architecturally beautiful; however it does have its flaws. It   s good, but missing that Disney magic. ",0
"The park is just outside Paris..40 mins by RER train from central Paris. We purchased tix in advance. On their website their was a list of rides which were going to be closed during our visit...but when we were at the park 2 other rides were also closed due to some technical problems.  Autopia  which is a car track had shut dwn 1 of its track for some reason even though there was a huge queue.Overall the experience was about average. There is'nt enough signage n maps thruout the park. Staff is helpful n courteous...but we felt there were too few atractions, too many restaurants n not enough to do..we have been to Disneyland USA, lots of six flags and Sesame St in USA before we moved out of USA. But wanted our lil one to have a disney experience. Overall we were quite disappointed with this one. Skip it if u have better options or less time.",0
"We booked our skip the line tickets online, and that served us well, as queues were horrendous. Our son is 12, so a bit too old for Mickey Mouse, and so he was interested mainly in the Star Wars attractions, of which the schedule and website (checked in advance, of course) assured us that there were plenty to choose for: some kind of show, some kind of Star Trooper training academy, a ride in the Millennium Falcon, and so forth... In short, a 12 year old SW fan's dream day. Well, first of all, we had troubles locating anything on the premises, due to an appalling lack of sign posts. In Florida, everything is signposted, re signposted, and re re signposted; in Paris, you've got to blunder :  Worst still, whenever we asked the staff, we were given conflicting   not to mention, erroneous   answers (so, basically, we were sent in the wrong places and made to blunder some more). Eventually, we found that the show had been cancelled due to poor numbers of attendees, the so called Star Trooper Academy was a glorified food court slash movie theater, and so on. A real disappointment.Of course, the gift shop was well stocked, and we ended up scrambling to save the day for our boy by buying him a load of stuff he didn't really want.Oh, and just FYI, all through this wonderful debacle, it rained cats and dogs. So, bah humbug as far as I'm concerned.",0
"Went to Disneyland Paris November 2012 with Mother and my 2,5 year old little girl. Park looks absolutely beautiful, very well constructed, very detailed perfection. But, very crowded and busy even out of the holiday season with bad weather. So long queues for even the simple attractions. Lunch in Mickey Cafe was great for my girl, the park she didn't find that interesting. But, guess you should go at least once in your life.",0
"My partner & I visited here 2 days ago just for the day. Disney is such a lovely place to be! Just a bit upset as a lot of the rides were closed when we were there in both parks and then at 5:10pm we tried to go on the tower of terror and it closed at 5:00pm due to the Star Wars show going on? There was no notices anywhere saying this? We was a bit angry at this. Wouldn't recommend going in January as the park is quiet so they feel they can shut rides, a lot of the food stalls were closed too, only the restaurants were open. Basically, we've been to Disney a few times and enjoyed it but going in January I really wouldn't recommend.",0
"We visited in March 2016, out of school holidays, and all I can say is that Disney have cornered the market in paid queuing. They are so adept at it that if there is not a sufficient queue they orchestrate one by shutting half the ride down or limiting the number of operating vehicles in a ride. When it's 3 degrees and raining this is a very cynical and malevolent manoeuvre, but a very cost effective one for Disney. Queuing is mostly without cover and then you have to sit on wet seats. Children's Buggies have to be left in the rain. I've been going there for the last 20 years so have noticed the changes, or in some cases lack of. For instance the Pirates of the Caribbean was magical 20 years ago now its dark, dank and lacking any sense of fun. Our Grandchildren (4 & 7) hated it.We did love the Hollywood Tower ride which was a real thrill when you eventually get in the lift, which took 40 minutes with a Fastpass.In conclusion, if they put as much effort into the rides and customer satisfaction, as they do the shops it would be a better experience. ",0
We went to both parks  needs a bit of update . There where quite a few smokers smoking but not in right place .,0
"I wish I could give 3 1 2 stars because that would be more accurate. However, this is a hard review because there are some positives, but there are some big negatives to Hong Kong Disney.POSITIVESWait Times   If you go during the week and get there when the park opens (generally at 10:30 AM), you will have 10 minute waits or less for the first couple of hours in the park. We went on a Monday in October and waited 5 10 minutes for all the major rides until around 1:30 2:00 when the park started to get more crowded. Even then, our longest wait was 30 minutes which would be considered short wait times by Orlando standards.Unique Rides   Big Grizzley Mountain is a superb ride that combines the best of Expedition Everest and Big Thunder Mountain. There are two great surprises on this ride that make it stand out as one of the best coasters Disney has assembled. HyperSpace Mountain combines a Star Wars theme to its classic ride to make it more exciting the original. And the new Iron Man ride is outstanding as well. Lastly, Mystic Manor takes the trackless innovation of Tokyo Disney's Winnie the Pooh and creates a Haunted Mansion experience that's truly one of the best.Shows   There are some terrific shows at the park, namely: Festival of the Lion King and Mickey and the Wondrous Book. Great music, costuming and special effects.NEGATIVESSize   Hong Kong Disneyland is definitely small which means you can pretty much do all the attractions in a single day. We choose to ride our favorite rides 2 3 times and we still rode 80% of the rides at the park.Cast Members   I can't even believe I'm saying this about a Disney property, but the Cast Members were lacking...by a lot! Rarely did we receive a smile. No Disney cheerfulness. No excitement whatsoever in any cast member we saw. It makes you realize how much of the Disney experience is wrapped up in the attitude of their cast members because it soured our taste of this park.Line Cutting   People must have cut in line on us a dozen times or more. It seemed accepted and even the cast members looked the other way (figuratively   because most were looking right at them and didn't do a thing). Again, this really took away from the experience. Nothing about the atmosphere at HK Disney seemed  Disney esque There are other minor items on both sides, but these are the major points of interest. Having been to 9 Disney parks around the world, this would definitely be at the bottom of the list.That being said, if you want to go and ride some terrific rides at a park that is not terribly crowded most of the time, then I would encourage you to go. Quite honestly, the little kids probably won't even notice. But the adults, they will notice that this park does not have the Disney mystique.",0
"Well I visited this place and had much higher expectations prior to arriving.You do walk into another world when you visit this place but to be it felt more like paying to enter a shopping centre full of cafe's, restaurants and merchandise! The cost also is excessive. We should have purchased online though it was a last minute decision and online booking can not be made for the same day so we paid at the gate, for 2 adults was about 160  euros (2 park entrance).There was one particular thing the little kid in me wanted to do and that was to visit Micky! We entered the place where you line up. After 10 mins of waiting without really any movement we asked how long it would take and was told about 50 minutes. I just didn't want to wait this long, the day was cold, long and drawn out at this place. If 50 minutes is normal wait during school term I can only imagine what the wait is in holidays!Anyway really I didn't know what I was going to expect but growing up the idea of disney land was wild and I didn't go. Now I have gone, maybe it would have been a bit better if I was a kid! :( I would never return to this place again myself and wife.Though if when I have kids I would take them for the experience I think they would enjoy it!My wife had fun here (25) so that's what counts really for me :)",0
"Our first mistake was to go in November,we froze. The little ones spent a lot of the time wrapped up in blankets in the pushchair. The features that were open working were appreciated by the children, as was the food,but not by me it was expensive during the day and at night.Two of us had been to florida, that is light years ahead of ParisI think it should be illustrated very plainly that when you go out of season  that you will freeze, and to take lots of cash as its expensive,I wont go again.",0
"Arrived at the resort on 5th December 2011 staying at Hotel Cheyenne. Checkin was swift and staff very polite, informed us of the block we were in and showed us on the map of hotel area.We were in block 12 Cochise. Found block easily and went inside top room which looked a bit tired and in need of refurb but only in there sleeping so was not particularly worried.Stayed half board (advisable or half board plus) as place has put up prices quite heftily.Chuckwagon cafe is where you eat your meals,and I would advise you to go prepared for a battle as it is like a war zone in there,leave your manners at home as nobody says excuse me thank you or please.I have spent many years going abroad but this is the first time I have noticed how rude and ignorant europeans are especially the Spaniards.We had one of our half board dinners in the chuckwagon cafe on the nighttime of our second day and aside from the free for all and the volume of noise it was a particularly nice all you can eat buffet, from starter thru to dessert it was very enjoyable.On our first night we ate at Annettes Diner and whilst it was good it was only burgers.The third night we ate at my daughters hotel the Santa Fe and the difference in attitudes and actions of the clientele was as wide as the atlantic.The meal was of similar standard and most enjoyable but the sense of calmness and the fact people were talking and not shouting and actually using manners was very welcome.Now on to the parks. The studio was quite quiet and was a pleasure to go around and we found that there was very little waiting time to get on the rides.My grandkids enjoyed themselves collecting autographs but I wish adults would realise this is for kids not themselves. Flying carpets attendant made the kids and adults laugh with his antics and funny voices whilst doing his job,it relaxed everyone and was nice to see someone enjoying doing their job.The main park was a disappointment ,as you walk in there is a christmas scene on Main Street but that was it apart from the visit Santa area and the chapparal theatre which was a christmas show but that is where it all stopped.The staff were all bored,sullen faced and just going through the motions.We took the grandkids to see Santa and had a thoroughly unhappy 2 hr wait to see him. The europeans even had 1 person queing up and as they got near the other 10 in the group appeared cimbed over the rope barrier and disappeared in to see Santa.The attendants did nothing to stop this routine and actually appeared to condone this.Another ruse that people used and that was not stopped was people getting in the disabled access area and being let in (some of these were relatives of staff members).After all this the park is looking tired and in need of a massive refurbishment but due to the fact it is open 365 days a year this is not possible and only bits at a time can be done and therefore a lot of rides that people really enjoy are closed for maintenance.Overall if they are advertising Christmas at Disney I expect more of an American style Christmas from an American company and a tawdry French Christmas",0
"MY wife and I took four grandkids to Disneyland over this spring break. $20 for parking. $732.00 for one day tickets. 2 bottles of water $7. 5 pieces of pizza and two drinks $49. two ball caps, a drinking cup, and a small snow globe as gifts   $97. And in that time we were there the kids went on 9 rides total. Sorry, but Disneyland is made up of waiting in lines, crowds of people, and high prices. It's for the kids. How do families who can't really afford this go here? ",0
"Visited both parks. They don't even nearly compare to the Californian parks. There is a lack of atmosphere, and the people that work there don't have the same spark. Don't go if you've been to the Californian park. ",0
Apart from the disney castle I couldn't distinguish this from any other theme park. During the 2 whole days we were there we saw no characters walking around. Not a single one. OK some of the rides were disney themed but apart from that it was just a theme park and once you take the disney out of it I'd rather go to Alton Towers. The best thing about the park was the firework display at the end of the night.,0
Queues at the main entrance are stretched because of the lack of staff available to let people in which was not ideal given it was very cold outside. Rides in the main park also show their age with two that broke down while we were queuing. The Studio park is pretty good though and I would recommend it above the main park.,0
Visited this park when on holiday in Hong Kong. It was much smaller than the  cousins  in Florida and Paris.I would not recommend if you have limited time in the city. It comprises 1 Park which can be done in 03 hours off peak.The quality of the rides and entertainment is on the same level as the other Disney Parks.,0
"Having enjoyed a magical trip to Disneyland Paris in 2002 I couldn't wait to return. Boy was I disappointed. 8 of us, 3 under 9yo returned last night from 5 day 4 night trip staying in Sante Fe hotel. (Separate review!) Toilets are disgusting, they used to be spotless on previous visit. Casey Jr train, princess boats, buzz light year ride and Pinocchio all broke down when we were on them. Indiana jones, caption eo, and autopia were all closed for our trip. The litter is appalling, it's everywhere. Food is expensive and sub standard. Queuing time for  interrupted  rides was ridiculous. We tried to voice our disappointment at  City Hall  only to be told to return the next day! The kids loved the parades, the 5.30, the late one at 10pm and especially the special swing into spring show but the late night show didn't compare with the fireworks show in previous years. It's such a pity to see standards have slipped so much. The park needs a major shake up and clean up to be in the same league as the American Disney parks. Tinkerbell had better sprinkle some magic dust here quickly!",0
Happiest place on earth only if u have not been to other Disneyland   You are able to endure the large China crowd. Overall package is good especially for family with kids. However better rides expected. There is no outstanding ride such as Transformer in USS etc ...,0
Stayed between Christmas and new year.  Absolutely crowded with queues of two hours for more popular rides and one hour for all others.  Very disappointed that we only went on a couple of rides a day due to crowds.  They really need to put more...More,0
"After years of attending as annual pass holder, the park is loosing its charm and Disney professionalism. The crowds are getting larger, price is up and the general clientele are getting rude. What used to be happy courteous staff has changed and no longer as helpful. My pass had issues that they could not solve the first day of the visit and after a half hour wait outside the gate, they let me in with a one day pass and an assurance that this  IT  issue would be fixed the next day. Next day, no fix, wait outside for 30 minutes and finally after a long verbal exchange about it may take a month since IT had a backlog, one person stepped up and repaired the problem even if for only a short time. As a paying customer I was unable to gain quick access, treated like I did something wrong and had no access to my benefits for two days. The magic for me has gone. ",0
"We booked the tickets online, thus avoid the queue at the entrance. The entrance fees and eateries inside the theme park were rather expensive. Rides were ok. It was quite crowded and some rides we had to wait for about 30 minutes. This is not the first time we were here, thus got a bit bored after a while. We do stay till the end as we wanted to watch the fireworks.",0
You can easily go around this park in a day which cannot be said about the other Disneyland parks in other countries. I like the fact that it is so easy to take pictures with mascots since they are all over the place and most of them are in the Fantasy Garden. Weekdays are great since there are less people around. ,0
"It is too crowded, and the waiting time is between 30 and 75 minutes on the different rides.As for most the amusement parks in the world, the food inside is terrible and very expensive. But I knew all this in advance, but for my son I wanted to visit anyway.One day is enough anyway.",0
"Having visited the Disney parks in Orlando previously, this was a disappointment. The California Disney is smaller, queues longer and staff less friendly.",0
"In comparison to paris disneyland, this park is much smaller and so over crowded, I think management should consider either minimizing number of entries per day, or since it is so successful maybe build an another park just like paris, we didn't enjoy our selves as much as we did in paris. ",0
This would be a great day out for 3   6 year olds if they had never been to an amusement park. Our 10 and 7 year old were not that excited about the place and I did expect a few more thrilling rides than there were. Hyperspace was good and at least you could get a time to return to ride rather than wait in the queue. Several of the rides were closed and the Ironman one hasn't opened yet. The boys enjoyed being on the Jedi Training and getting to fight Darth Vader but all in all when asked if they would like to go back they said  No .,0
My family and I were at Paris Disneyland on 1 Jan 2012. This is our first trip to Disneyland. My kids were very excited but we only managed to try one ride at the Park. It's way too crowded here. I would suggest Disneyland to apply designated date tickets. By doing this everybody will have the chance to play at least half of what Disneyland has to offer. It took us 14 hours by plane to reach there and we ended up trying only few rides. its very disappointed.,0
We went there under impression that it will be similar to Universal Studios in singapore . But the rides are for infants and this park has nothing in store for adults seeking thrilling experience .  In particular we liked the 3D animated show . Rest...More,0
"We took three young kids here for a day out, and while the kids loved it, 80% of the adults we saw in queues looked dead in the eyes and were probably hoping for the sweet release of death as they waited for 40, 50, 60...90 minutes for a ride which lasted at most 10 minutes. The other thing that baffles me is that when the park opens at 10am, there are virtually no cafes open inside: I had to queue for 55 minutes for a couple of doughnuts, a muffin, and some warmish brown liquid (supposedly coffee). A piece of advice: bring as much of your own food and especially drink as you can, because a small bottle of water or coke (etc.) costs    3!Also: forget about wifi or mobile phone reception     how the hell Disney managed to build park near one of Europe's largest capitals where both are merely a tantalising joke beats me (also, this means forget about using their app and grab a park map at the entrance).",0
With what I would class as only 2 major rides not a great deal to keep older children occupied. Everything you expect from Disney  including characters and parades (unless it's raining) Overall a bit of a let down especially for those with US Disney experience.,0
"I'm a native Californian who has been to Disneyland in Anaheim probably 100 times (no joke), so obviously I have a bias. Many beautiful memories have been created there.In 2013, my grown daughter and I were in Paris and decided to go to Disneyland. We had no idea what to expect, except we thought it would be similar to the Anaheim park. Wow, were we disappointed. We knew right away that something was amiss when we heard no music playing at the entrance. There wasn't a flower to be seen anywhere (this was in April!), and we were actually starving for food. I mean, no food at Disneyland? Criminal. We found just ONE restaurant open, and the food was mediocre to terrible. A real disappointment. The rides, too, were quite different from the original    mostly rollercoasters (even Indiana Jones). Overall, it was a depressing experience, and we vowed never to go back.And then ... we decided to give it another try. We went again in early Sept. 2017, on a day that ended up being pretty rainy and blustery. But up until then, we were pleasantly surprised at the improvements they have made to the park (both the Disneyland side and the Studios side). There was wonderful music playing everywhere and flowers blooming (although they could still do more with the landscaping). New rides had come along, including Ratatouille, which we loved. The whole Pirates area was pretty cool, too. While the park still doesn't have the sparkle and magic of the original Disneyland, it has charm. The light and fireworks show on the castle at night was well done.The people running the rides seemed to genuinely enjoy their jobs, and they were fun to interact with. We had fun in both parks.Having said that, we noticed two major problems: 1) The food: Where is it? Yes, this time there were a few more places open, but most of the small carts served exactly the same thing (weird!). Also, at dinnertime    and in the rain    we searched for an open restaurant, and nearly all of them were closed. What? We finally found one that was open, where an average dinner started at $25! We wandered around (getting soaked) and finally found one place that was more reasonably priced. But we passed restaurant after restaurant that were closed at 7 pm. What gives? The food we did eat was passable, but not very good. This time, we brought our own lunch    we saw a lot of other people doing the same thing. They're losing a lot of money by not fixing this problem. But we thought for sure we'd be able to find a decent place for dinner. Wrong!2) The service: They need to hire more people. This was evident in both the shops and the food service areas, where service was so slow, it was ridiculous. At one of the small food carts, we waited 10 minutes to get to the front of the line    and we were behind ONE person! But we were so hungry, we decided to stick it out. The park also isn't as clean as it should be. We noticed trash in some areas, which we never see at the Disneyland in Anaheim. The bathrooms were OK but could be shinier. This park could be so much better with some minor adjustments: more and tastier food options, more service workers, more attention to the look and feel (more flowers and fun things to look at, please!), some better rides (get rid of the Rock 'n' Rollercoaster, that was actually silent    no rock music playing, which was bizarre). But the park is improving. Perhaps it was gussied up for its 25th anniversary and won't stay that way, but I hope that they keep going in this direction. If so, then we would go back, since we now live nearby.If you're an American who has been to the original Disneyland, going to this park will seem a bit surreal to you. Like it's ALMOST Disneyland, but not quite.",0
I have been to Disneyland more times than I can count and it's just within the last year that I have grown to dislike Disneyland. Our last visit in late October did not help. It is so busy and crowded and most of the people that work there seem miserable! For the price we have to pay to get in there it just doesn't seem worth it anymore. ,0
A smaller version of the Anaheim California father but not quite up to Disney's standard. Not many rides and a self play options. I've visited their other properties and this is probably their weakest offering,0
I travelled with my 11 & 14yr old kids and were all bored & disappointed with the place. The place is ideal for toddlers but not for young adults. Rides for the young adult are very limited. Food within the park is expensive and tasteless. Ocean park is way much better and cheaper.,0
"Very expensive tickets considering a good few of the more exciting rides not open. For the teenagers disappointing, fine for the smaller kids. Make sure you look at the website before you go to see all the rides that are closed   Thunder mountain, Space Mountain,Pirate Galleon, and Star Tours were closed when we visited last week.",0
"Ok, so this is my third visit to eurodisney and I guess you're always trying to relive that first visit. That said, I found on this occasion that the whole place just felt like it was sellotaped together and just about holding on which is a shame as that's not the magic we come to expect and love from Disney.The park itself is gold and well themed. Rides are still good but regulatory seemed out of action at varying times.Real icing on the cake was the obligatory stop to pull the sword from the stone only to find THERE WAS NO SWORD IN THE STONE! My kids were both astounded .. As were we!Afternoon parade is good and I prefer it being early. Laser show and fountains are amazing too and definitely worth staying up and having ratty kids all the next day!It is a shame, but we did decide this is our last visit... As much as it pains me to say it, we're going to save and go to America. If you're reading and you care though, eurodisney ... It's time to pull your socks up. ",0
"Our family was there during Christmas break. The park was packed or should I write  overcrowded ... It took us close to 3 hours for  It's a small world  ride! That has never happened before at Disney World in Orlando. Without being with two teenagers, we would have given up. The lines were just too long and the traffic was bad in the park. Getting foods was stressful. It was too hectic for us. We ended up going across the way to Disney Adventure Park, which has more rides and activities for the older kids, therefore it was less crowded.If you have smaller children, do not go around Christmas time. It would be too stressful for all. Disney needs to reconsider the maximum capacity of this park with thoughtful consideration regarding the lines for popular rides. We do not plan to return to Disneyland in Anaheim CA. WE LOVE DISNEY WORLD in Florida. We have been there 5 times and still want to go back. I hope that if you go to this park at another time of the year, it would be more enjoyable.",0
My second visit. Still as fun n happy. Disappointed by the breakdown of Rodney ride and Huanted House. Extremely disappointed that the firework at the castle was cancelled due to strong wind. I didn't get to watch the fireworks show the other time for the same reason. ,0
"Its good but quite kiddish. Its basically for kids below 12 years, not worth for teenagers. We visited it as my daughter didn't want to leave Hongkong without visiting disneyland",0
"We all know that Disney is expensive but when you have to stand inline for an hour for a 2 minute rise it is simply not acceptable. We were there between Christmas and new year and as of 10AM is was near impossible to get into a ride. The park was saturated. Disney should limit the amount of people they admit into the park so that it would be a magical moment for the people in the park. With hotels a three day admission for 4 we spent in excess of $ 2,000. Hind sight being 20 20 I will spend this money at other attractions.",0
"The wait time too long, can't go on many rides in a day .there was not much too enjoy as the place was too crowded.",0
"this disney is aimed at the younger audience as theres not dead loads there & they start closing down the rides very early. evening parade cancelled when we were there due to weather , there was only 2 spots of rain",0
"Of course you want to go to this park with the kids as all the Disney figures are in the park. But they need to do something with the lines. It's too long for children's to wait for an hour or 1.5hour to wait for an attraction of 2 minutes. Also the lines to make a picture with one of the figures... There must be a solution... Make some places where the figures come and kids can make pictures with them. Also with small children's you need 2 days to make sure that they can see everything, but the tickets are also too expensive. So to be honest... You have other attractionparcs where you can go with the children's... You pay less and your childrens will enjoy as well.. Create moments and don't pay too much too create happy moments if there are other parcs as well... ",0
"It is my 3rd time here in 5 years and I enjoyed it this time too. The park was way cleaner years ago and better organized. No new rides opened here , while other theme parks build new ones yearly. Disney spirit is what dragged me here a 3rd time , but different unpleasant smells and overall cleanliness really blew my enthusiast a few times. It was way better the first and second time I visited. Rides were as fun as always but compared to other Disneyland parks I visited ( Florida and Los Angeles ) , it isn't as great , the atmosphere doesn't drag you in as much. Remember to also buy tickets for both parks , as Studios is the more thrilling one.Overall I would obviously recommend anyone to at least visit it one time , it is still amazing and fun!",0
"We had a very happy visit   the sun shone   the rides were fun   the queues ( or lines if you prefer) were pretty reasonable   so why the average review? Too many key attractions were out of action e.g. Thunder Mountain and the adjacent lake and 'Steamboat'   the prices everywhere were hideous   3.5 euros for a 500 ml bottle of water   really? It isn't cheap to get in   and no meaningful concession for the amount of work going on This was our third visit   in the past upgrades have seemingly been done discretely and 'out if sight' My advice to travellers is to check before you go to manage your own expectations , bring your own refillable water bottles !We were determined to have fun and we succeeded on a lovely day in August.",0
"We were looking forward to a family break to Disneyland Paris. TBH to experience was okay, it wasn't outstanding!! Space mountain was closed as was pirates of the Caribbean. We all wondered how France actually functions as a country as almost everywhere we ate took an age to be served which was painful in every experience. Particularly at Victoria (top of Main Street) who were ripping everyone off overcharging on a meal deal!! We watched as customer after customer kicked off for being overcharged, the inefficient staff didn't have a clue on service here. Bring your own I would say it's a lot less bother. That said we enjoyed many of the parks attractions and tomorrow we are off to Disney studios ",0
"Travelled from Australia with two kids and loved it except that we have now learnt that be very careful when booking flights holidays etc in advance (which most of us would do) actually contact places such as Disneyland to find out what won't be open operating during your intended time there. We had 5 day park hopper tickets. You would think in that time that there would have been parades   none   fireworks   none   and there was quite a bit shut down. Considering this took us forever to save for, looked forward to and to come home disappointed...well we still made the holiday wonderful but always check ahead before booking holiday and setting your definate holiday dates.",0
"I don't know if it was a special disabled persons day (which I don't think it was) or if D land's new policies let just anybody use one of their wheelchairs, but they were EVERYWHERE. I absolutely am all for making concessions for the disabled, but it was quite obvious that many wheelchairs were being used by people gaming the system so that they and their 15 relatives could line jump. Sort of ruined my D land experience.",0
Had a great day at Euro Disney. Considering it was the weekend before xmas it wasn't too busy either Having read some reviews I was aware that the food in the resort is expensive though I was still surprised quite how expensive we found the Golden Nugget to be the best value and nicest location for what we wanted some of the others were pretty nasty particularly the burger bar and the pizza restaurant. Our big disappointment however was the closing firework spectacular. We hung around in the cold and dark for a couple of hours to see the fireworks (the show starts at 10pm on Saturdays) but their was no firework spectacular there were no announcements and no apologies from the resort and we heard lots of other people complaining about their disappointment too. ,0
"Full disclosure: I am an adult who promised a Disneyland trip to my daughter so I wasn't overly enthusiastic about the trip to begin with.Pros: The kids love it. Really. And Disney really does do  magic  like no other theme parks anywhere. The park is clean and well maintained and they make sure to maintain the illusion as best as humanly possible. During the summer peak season they schedule a lot of events so that there's always something to do.Cons: This place is overpriced. Every which way. Entrance, lodging, dining, photos, souvenirs. Everything. And the lines. My God, the lines! Lines for rides. Yes, you can do the  fastpass  thing but you have to get there early for the popular rides and those are gone, too. And you have to be available during the scheduled fastpass time. Barely any more convenient than just waiting in line. Besides, in addition to waiting for rides there are also lines for food, characters, monorail. Expect to do a lot of waiting.Our trip was exhausting. And we stayed at the Disney hotel so we had more convenient access than if we had stayed farther afield. But my daughter was aglow and is still bubbling with stories and songs from our trip 3 months later. So the bottom line is that if you have a little Disney fanatic you should make the trip but be cost conscious and plan carefully when you do.",0
"My daughter and I were on a college tour in California. We decided to rent a car and drive to Disneyland from LA. This park is very small compared to Disney World. Since we were in Cali, we had to go. I would definetely go...More",0
"We have visited Disneyland Paris before and never been disappointed however when you pay over   150 for three of you for a day pass you don't expect so many attractions to be closed in the height of summer. Would recommend visiting the special effects ride and have your video camera ready for millions of gallons of water coming at you but you don't get wet, superb ride. As usual huge prices for everything everywhere made worse by exchange rate so if you're going take loads of cash with you. ",0
"If you are a adult and you like of emotion, maybe this is not the perfect place.You can have a bit emotion, but not enough. However, if you don't have the habit to do something with lots emotion or if you are young, probably you will enjoy this park.",0
"Disney is still a wonderful experience but I have to wonder how in the world a family of four could possible afford to go there. The lines were somewhat reasonable. The only lengthy wait was the Matterhorn. As always the park was very clean and the restrooms were very clean as well. Great family oriented rides but the cost is just ludicrous. We spent 13 hours between the two parks and rode everything we were interested in but that much time was almost painful. It was, obviously, trying to avoid going a second day. The experience is still good but it appears they are trying to limit the crowds by jacking up the prices into the stratosphere. ",0
"Feels more like a shopping mall with rides inside it. The staff are friendly and there are lot of small things to buy for great memories. However, if you've been to any other disney lands you'll be really disappointed. The castle is just so small it's like a fort. You can walk around the place in an hour. There are 2 shows that you should circle in if you do go there. The golden mickey's and the festival of the lion king. However, if you've seen the broadway lion king you will be really underwhelmed by the performance. The show in LA is also much better. Cost 450 hong kong dollars to get in if you buy the tickets at the entrance. The tickets are cheaper if you get them from the airport when you are flying in from wherever you are coming from. If you've never been to a disneyland then go, if you've been to other ones it's not worth the price of admission.",0
"Visited this place on 10th April 2018. Unfortunately, Hong Kong Disneyland decided to undergo some major renovation to the main building photo op area, the Cinderella Castle, at this time. Can   t postpone our visit here coz we   ve already bought plane tickets & booked hotel room 3 months beforehand.Even on a weekday this place is terribly crowded. The lines for taking photo with Mickey & Minnie Mouse was ridiculously long. Spent more than an hour to do so causing us to not able to go for some of the rides by the end of the day.My advice is to go here sometime 2023 onwards when their last addition (some new Marvel themed attraction) is scheduled to open.",0
"A little disappointed on our 1st visit this August with my 5.yr old Grand daughter.'It's a Small World' was closed, the only characters we saw walking about were Mickey, Minnie & Pooh Bear, (none of which my G D was interested in), the waiting time to see the Princesses was 2 hours & we were kept waiting outside in the pouring rain for the 'Frozen' sing along for an hour even though the theatre was empty.I won't be going again, though of course my Grand daughter will, eventually.",0
"I am somewhat bias in writing this review in that I have made multiple visits to Disneyland Florida prior to this visit so this park was always going to have a lot to live up to. We visited in the off season which had both its pros and cons.We didnt have to queue for long for any of the rides which is always a bonus. On the other hand some of the rides were closed for renovation etc (which is understandable also).We found it difficult to find places to eat and drink in each of the  lands  as once again places were closed for the off season. It seemed as though only one restaurant was open in each of the lands. Again this is understandable but when we did eat we found ourselves queuing for longer than we would have liked for what was effectively cold food.We spent most of the afternoon wandering the park and saw most of the attractions. We also saw the parade in the afternoon which was fun and enjoyed the Halloween themed decorations. Finally, and I tell not a word of a lie but on leaving the gates of the park and heading towards the exit, I saw what appeared to be a rodent scurry across one of the bandstand pavillons and into a hole crack underneath.In summary, I enjoyed seeing Disneyland Paris and enjoyed the lack of queues etc but the park was just that little bit too quiet for me to enjoy it fully.",0
We had an enjoyable day there. But we're disappointed as space mountain and winnie the pooh were under maintenance. Most of the rides are for younger children so we were really looking foward to the space mountain. Oh well...we did have fun at the end of the day. Do not miss the fireworks. It was amazing. I would appreciate if the shops were to close a little later. We did not have time to shop as we were trying to cover as much as we can in the park. So the best time to shop would be after the fireworks.,0
"Disneyland was never going to be my cup of tea. I got a good deal on tickets from Klook, which lessened the pain somewhat. But it is still prohibitively expensive, especially when you add in transport and overpriced food and souvenirs. Even on a relatively quiet mid week day it was crowded and most of the rides had 10 30 minute waits. The kids maintained their enthusiasm reasonably well and perhaps there is benefit in teaching patience. We stayed for the best part of a day but only saw about a third of the park. If you are a Disney enthusiast, I would suggest two full days, especially if you are there during a busy time. In the interests of balance, I asked the kids for a different perspective. This is how it looked to the people that really matter :From my four year old son: My favourite part was hugging Mickey and Minnie and the Ding Dong train (Hong Kong Disneyland Railroad). My next favourite was the Dumbo the Flying Elephant ride and the horsey ride (Cinderella Carousel). I even liked the new train that took us there (Disneyland MTR line). The dog one (Slinky Dog Spin ride in Toy Story land) was very scary. Eight year old daughter had a similar perspective: The visit to Disneyland was special for me because there is no Disneyland in Sydney where I live. I have never been to any Disneyland except this one in Hong Kong. I liked the Dumbo merry go round because you can steer it up and down. I also liked the Cinderella horse merry go round. I got on a big white horse that looked angry and fast. Then we watched the Disney characters go in a parade. The only thing I disliked was having to wait in line. ",0
Plede read this review in the context of someone who has been to most of the Disney parks! Paris great and very beautiful but it lacks some of the special detail that you really notice at other Disney parks like their brilliant queue management systems and long queue distraction systems. On the day we went at least 2 major rides were closed for several hours due to technical issues. I also found this park much more pitched at the under 10's. having said all this I think that if you have never had a Disneyland experience then it is a must do!,0
So we decided that we would have a lovely day at Disneyland on a Tuesday in March and the place was absolutely packed! We are a gay couple in our mid 30s and this place was really more for families and kids that don't mind waiting in long lines for every ride. There were strollers everywhere! We had a much better time at the other park California Adventures.,0
"we went the tuesday after thanksgiving and was fairly quiet, the indiana jones ride was out , the haunted mansion was lame, in all it was not very good   the universal studios was far better. but it is a case of been there done that",0
"We went for four nights in half term with 2 young children. I had previous been 22 years before and was surprised to find the same rides such as 'it's a small world after all' Peter Pan ride and Pirates of the carribean.The food in the park was of poor quality. The queues for the food were long and in some places such as Casey Jones there were 3 staff but only one serving!! This happened more than once!!The price of food and drink was extortionate!! 4 euros for a drink of water!!Often staff didn't know when or where parades were on or happening so we had to rely on other holiday makers who had been before.We also queued for 2 hours to meet a princess. Surely they could be more organised and have more princesses available!! Or have fast track tickets.We were all underwhelmed by the night illuminations and wasn't worth the wait.Disney has a lot to do to make this a first class experience.We would highly rate the parades and the pirates and princesses actors. The dancers and acrobats were amazing and the best bit of Disney. They interacted with the crowd and made the children's experience magical.I would also highly rate the meet Disney characters breakfast. This was magical for the children, well organised and you met 5 characters who had time for each table.",0
"We visited this park Saturday 28 January and it was VERY busy. We couldn't believe it. We have visited Disney in Florida many times and there is just no comparison. Florida every time!! We got round the parks in Florida in JULY better than we got round the Paris Park. It was very, very cold which didn't help as the  cast  must have been suffering. The thing that struck me was there were inaccurate or no waiting times on the boards at the rides. Thunder Mountain, for instance, had a supposed waiting time on the board of 15 minutes and we went ahead to ride and too late realised we were trapped for an hour! Almost all rides were an hour. Fast passes didn't seem to work too well   possibly because there was only a half hour time slot given whereas in Florida it's an hour   so fast passes had to be moved through it seemed at great cost to the normal queue. The crowd management was not good. We did persevere and got on most of the things but it took all day and we had no time to repeat. It was disappointing as we thought January would be quiet. I can only assume there are a lot of deals going about at the moment which is good news for Disney! We had a deal but I noticed the gate price was 71 euros for an adult   so buy in advance. As has been said, food is very expensive in the Park   about 10 euros we paid for fish and chips. Disney Village is a bit of a letdown. A couple of Disney shops and some very disappointing restaurants. We ate in the Rainforest Cafe. Indifferent food for expensive prices. Also, King Ludwig's is worth avoiding. We were served lukewarm steaks that had been clearly sitting around while we had our starters. Steaks were about 18 euros too. A bottle of wine will set you back that also. It is worthwhile investing in The Unofficial Guide to Disneyland Paris or similar which will give you tips and also information on alternatives to Disney eating. I also agree with the person who said the lighting at night in the Park was terrible. I felt we were picking our way around and it made the whole place look even more miserable. Added to that, they had closed bits and rides for refurbishing so that didn't help the ambience. All in all, I wouldn't rush back.",0
"As a family, we have visited Disney in Orlando over six times and have certain expectations of the theme parks. We took a trip to Disneyland Paris prior to attending a family wedding in England. The park was clean and the rides were enjoyable. However, the service was horrible, as the staff either chose to ignore you or not complete your request in the intended manner. We enjoyed the day trip to Paris and visited all of the landmarks which was a highlight. We will return to Paris again, but stay somewhere else.",0
"Took 1 hr from the freeway exit to the parking garage. Signs to the garage are poor. Verbal directions from Disneyland were difficult to follow   and we had a GPS! Seems to be set up best for people to stay in Disney resort hotels. Bring water bottles that can be filled at infrequently placed water fountains. Bring healthy snacks or pay $2 for an apple.Indiana Jones and Space Mountain  broke  so we never got to go on them. We waited 85 min for Nemo's submarine. Use the FastPass system.  Cast members  weren't friendly. Long, long lines to purchase food. DIsney characters were few and far between  only saw the evil queen in snow white in 12 hours (but she snarled perfectly) Parade a blast!",0
"Disneyland paris is a fun place with plenty of rides and attractions for children, especially younger ones. It was relatively easy to get around and see most things in 2 3 days. We particularly enjoyed the motor and bike stunt show . Downsides were the long queues for some attractions, e.g Pirates of the Caribbean was almost a hour long queue. The food and drinks were also a bit expensive.",0
Disneyland is expensive and way over rated .Gold reef city compares very good with Disneyland and even some of the rides are better than the ones in the parkTo get to meet some of the caracters you must stand in que's for hours on end This is not at all as glamourous as it sounds,0
"Disneyland was extremely disappointing for us as our daughter is 11 and most rides suited 8 and under children, not much happens here and the atmosphere is pretty low key. The music that is played constantly throughout the park sends you a little insane after a while.",0
"have been going to disney for the last forty years, but this last oct 11, 2015was the worst, number one reason, the heat awful, the weather was terrible,I know its not disneys fault, they cant control the weather, but it was a sunday and found out thats when all the annual pass holders get to go inalso the next day was a holidayI have never seen disney so packedthe reason Im giving three stars, I normally would never give it less than five, butI felt it was disorganized after the parade, they corraled people in the middle of main street in preparation for the fireworks, now you dont pack people in the middle of main street after parade, open up main street so other people can get through,I asked about this and they said it was because of the 60th anniversary they changed things upI just have never seen it so crowded and the heat was horriblethe drive time into the park like one hour, but I heard it was because of traffic,half our party drove in and the other half scootered it in, and we were one hour earlierjust the long drive and wait was already irritatingand the poor castmembers, why make them wear their heavy hot uniforms on a day like that, to me that was workplace abuse, for the ones that had to dress in the costumelike haunted housethe castmembers gotta give them credit in one of the worst heat at disneyi have never felt that heat and humidity in disneyland and again i would never give it less than five stars, but i just felt for the crowd improvements can be made",0
"Love Disneyland and always will but was disappointed over Presidents Day Weekend that some of the rides kept having problems and shutting down for sometimes up to an hour and it didn't just once a day but two or three times a day. That was in addition to the rides closed for refurbishment. The Matterhorn, Indiana Jones, and the Haunted Mansion were working on again off again all weekend. Buzz Light Year Astro Blasters shut down for a few minutes each time we were on it but nothing like the others.",0
"Super compact, it's a very small park with only a handful of rides. Definitely excited to see the rest of the park open up. Ride the RC Car, it's goof!",0
"First of all, I must say that when we visited it was cold and drizzling, so that might affect the review a little. We took the special Disney themed MTR ( Magical Train Ride ? They really should have taken advantage of this acronym) to the park. We arrived at the Western styled train station which was, of course, very Disney, but also gave us the impression of a slightly  cheap knock off  effect...Ticket for entry was HK$450 for an adult, which is very similar to a ticket price for Alton Towers in the UK, but in terms for bang for your buck, this place was lacking. Disney is still very popular in Hong Kong and China, so obviously a theme park here would do great business, but having been to theme parks before, my wife and I had certain expectations. My wife especially so, since she has been to the Disneyland in Florida. The trademarked Disney castle was shamefully small. The rides were not incredibly thrilling. That is not to say they weren't fun, but their warning to tell riders to remove their glasses for Space Mountain, were very overcautious. I just ended up feeling quite sick for not having my glasses on as I could not see the ride. The best rides were the Runaway Mine Cars and Mystic Manor, but since there are only 6 or so rides there, there aren't many to choose from. We managed to spend 4 hours in the theme park, but we left with a mostly dissatisfied view of the place. The place obviously had to cater more to the locals and so, the place concentrated on shows, souvenir shops, and eateries, which were not our thing. At least, I can say, we have visited it now, but I think if you want a true Disney experience, then this is not the Disneyland to visit.",0
"I was very excited to visit both Disney parks: Main one and Disney Studios.I bought 2 days 2 parks ticket to see all the attractions and I was disapointed. I can compare it to Disneyland at Tokyo that I visited and I loved it. The european park is overrated  it needs to be renovated. Most of the rides seems broken, have scraches and broken elements. If this you are planning your first disney experiance.In general, if it's ok with your budget I advise you to save a little bit longer and have a nice holidays at USA Disneylands. The Paris one is nice, but disappointing. Because of its condition it doesn't have any magic in it.On my first day I went to Disney Studios. The park is so, so, more simple and less fairy than the main one. You need less than one day to visit and ride all the attractions  I was there at opening hours (10:00) and after 16:00 I've seen all. The rides are not so entertaining as at the Disney Parks in California or Tokyo. They lasts short and are less interactive  they are, for me overdated. It happened to me at least 4 times, that the ride got broken during riding. It was fixed but it was not so fun. What I recommend if you are 20  is: nemo ride ( Crush's Coaster  )  super speed plus suddenly drops, Twilight Zone of Terror Tower  no lines to wait. Don't miss the Show Mickey and the Magician  it's at the toon studio  super entertaining, 30 mini musical with mickey and the classic disney characters. I'm 23 and I loved it! I also loved Ratatouille: The Adventure. It's a very moder and fun ride, worth waiting. The food at Disney studio is nice, you get a big portions at every food point but it's quite expensive  16 euro per one hamburger set. I recommend to avoid popular lunch time and hit the most popular rides at that time. Also, remember to use disney fast pass to avoid waiting. You can get it at special points next to a ride. You can get one admission per one ticket  you scan it every 2 3h. The main park is very crowded and when I visited it (July 2016) I was in construction in many areas  one  land  had only one ride working! The rest is ok, it's not so  OMG  as the japanesee park was ( it's much more modern, like the ones in the USA). I was not charmed at all ( altho I tried my best...). Again, the food was expensive but nice. The lines you were supposed to wait we're just killing me  it took ages to get to popular ride (at least 60 min waiting) and rides itself were  used out  and in bad condition. It was not bad, but it was not that  disney magic  would you expect. I had a geat first impression at Disneyland Tokyo so I felt that I wasted my money on the Paris one. If you are still planning to visit it I recommend you to: Plan the tripThe park is big so you need to plan how to spend your time. I managed to see all in 2 days, but some of the rides were closed  visit Disneyland Paris site, see the rides and plan what you want to see the most, also try to goolge how it looks  I for instance was very into special effects ride at Disney Studio but it was so,so and I lost a lot of time on it. Download the official app. You will get the map of rides, restaurants and shops plus info how long you will have to wait to a ride. It helps a LOT when planning what to see first. WATCH OUT, there is no free wi fi at the park! Use your Fast Pass wiseChoose the coolest rides and get a fast pass for them to avoid 2h of waiting. My advise:Disney Studio:Crush's Coaster  Ratatouille: The AdventureRC RacerDisneyland Paris:Buzz Lightyear Laser BlastPeter Pan's FlightSpace Mountain  : Mission 2Star Tours  Try not to bring backpacks, big bags, umbrellas. It will be hard to keep them close to you on any ride. Visit the shops. They are nice and most of them have different marchendise to buy Look closer and be curious. I found an amazing ice cream spot and nice small food trucks, it's easy to miss cool places on the main street.",0
Nice selection of F&B but almost one hundred dollars for pizza?!    My suggestion...check out the food venues BEFORE the kids are hungry and budget accordingly.,0
"With younger kids, never dawned on us that Disney would have  Grad Night  events... wish we thought or heard about it. The parks were packed the couple of days we visited in early June, and not just packed making for long lines (for those w o fastpass like Matterhorn, Tower of Terror which didn't have FP running any of the days we were there), but also the teenagers were being teenagers... so pretty crazy scene there. Congratulations to them, just wish we knew better to plan smarter. Still had a good time, but couldn't help thinking that it would've been better, like all other Disney (Land or World) visits when most of the park wasn't filled with excited, crazy high school grads.",0
"We travelled to Disneyland Paris with our toddler, baby son and my niece. This is the first time my children have been and maybe the only time my niece gets to go.Having travelled to Disney Paris and Orlando as a couple, it was an eye opening experience for the first time travelling with a family. I would highly recommend you bring in your own food and drink (or refillable bottle) as a bottle of water and an ice lolly with set you back 7 Euros.I really wanted to enjoy this holiday and more importantly I wanted the kids to enjoy it. Our initial disappointment came with the large number of main attractions that were closed for renovation (Pirates of the Caribbean, Phantom Manor and the Mat Hatter Tea Cups).More annoyingly we had 5 rides break down within the 2 days we were at the park, either when we were on it, before we got to it or after we had queued for it!These were:1. Peter Pans Flight   broke down while riding for 10 15 minutes2. Buzz Lightyear Ride   broke down 3 times while riding3. Slinky Rollercoaster   broke down half way through queuing4. Aladdin Magic Carpet Ride   broke down immediately after Slinky Dog ride5. Armageddon experience   was closed when we walked past and then had technical difficulties as soon as it re openedOther guests also informed me that Twilight Zone Tower of Terror and Aerosmith Rockin Roller Coaster also broke down the day we were at the studios.Hardly the experience you hope for when you pay   696 for park tickets. Several parts of other rides were also clearly not working, including one of the trams on the studio backlot tour, which increased queuing times.The staff at customer services were friendly and offered us VIP fast pass tickets for the remainder of our stay. However, as I complained more than halfway through our 2 day visit, the kids were already beside themselves tired and has returned to the hotel, so we couldn't make best use of the tickets.I hope someone from the park reads this as the high amount of technical problems and closed rides is hardly worth the full price of admission. Not all rides have fast passes either. Crushes Coaster was a 75 minute wait when the park opened and a 90 minute wait when the park closed. The Princess pavillion had a wait of 60 75 minutes all day and in the end you only meet one princess and you don't get to choose which! thank goodness my daughter loves beauty and the beast!",0
"I have been many times to various Disney Parks and believe me this is the most disappointing one. If you've never been to the others then I suppose you will love It. The staff are very unfriendly generally and have no patience or time for you. So different from Disney Florida. We were looking specifically for one certain toy and asked everywhere for some help. They were so unhelpful and sometimes even a little rude. They had no explanation or suggestions for a nine year old little girl. One reason for this might be the care Disney give the staff   one very hot afternoon we were waiting for the procession, having found a great place to sit in a cafe. One female member of staff was on duty just outside of the cafe and trying her best to move people on when she just stopped to lean against the wall. I asked her if she was ok and she just said Yes, but that she felt she was dying as she was so hot. She said her clothes were sticking to her and that they were made of cheap polyester  nylon material. Then she said'That's how much Disney cares for us'. I couldn't believe this, I had always thought that the clothes, black horrible trousers etc looked terrible but that they must be cool linen. She was so miserable and fed up I really did pity her.One other BIG problem there is the queue jumping they have. We went on most of the rides and this was happening all the time. One or two members of a family went into the queue and they would then usually ring other members of family etc when they got nearer the ride and they would then join them. This would very often be 5 6 or more members. Ridiculous. Who minds if a child and mum joins? Nobody but this was not the case. There were no Disney cast members around to inform. Sometimes we said something but were always met with rude comments and threatening stares so what could we do that would not spoil our very expensive holiday. Best to go to Hollywood and to Universal Studious. Great, very efficient and happy place!",0
"I loved Disneyland as a child but these days the magic has been lost, all you do is spend a lot of money on useless momentos and wait in ques for over an hour, we took our almost two year old I can say that we took him on a total of 4 rides in the two days we went, tea cups twice because the waiting time is less than 5 mins, it's a small world which he loved twice also a 10 min que, we also waited half an hour for the train that goes round the park which you can spend half your day on by the time it goes around. We also qued for 35 mins for the slinky ride which he enjoyed. The problem with all these rides are the attention span of the children in the ques before they get to the ride the magic has gone they are over it. For a young family we can not afford to use the fast track facility, and we are lucky that we have a able bodied child, as these are both well catered for in the park, but leaves the average family lacking in service.In summary I think that Disneyland ParisIs Outdated, overcrowded, underwelming. Sad to say. I mean when did anyone last see Armageddon or Indiana jones?",0
"Wow so busy!! We chose to go on New Year's Eve (OMG we could hardly move) which was bad planning on our part so unfortunately our teens didn't get to go on many rides. Also, sadly we did not see one Disney character. We did however return 2 days later & used our Magic Moment pass and entered at 7am however Adventureland and Frontierland were closed off and so were the Matterhorn Bobsleds so all the things my teens wanted to do in that 1 hr advantage were not available. Again not one Disney character to be seen. So all in all I'm done with Disneyland.",0
"First time we have been to this disney park, it was really busy, and we had to wait for at least 45 mins on every ride we went on, well all two of them, indiana jones broke down after 45 mins, so left the que, went to see the disney characters and couldnt find them, only one, and was told that we had to wait until the next time slot, my daughter was very upset, we had travelled all the way from uk. We went into the adventureland park, and the rides were two hours plus, so didnt get abything. 165 dollars to go on 2 rides, is very expensive.",0
"Having visited the original Disney World many times, we were frustrated with our experienced in Disney Paris.Although some attractions are as nice as in Orlando, a great deal of the experience is related to the care and environment created for the little ones, something that is not a strong feature of the French people.Most workers made no effort to please and didn't even pretend to be part of the attractions, as it usually happens in the original park.In the Indiana Jones coaster, we had 4 people measuring and arguing about our daughter's height, with no concern at all with how she felt. When they finally decided it was ok, she was so scared with the discussion that declined to go.In regard to food, most kiosks were closed. Also, we were not allowed in one of the  quick meal  burger restaurants with a small stroller because there would be a band. Is this Disneyland or Vegas?Many of the attractions focused on little kids were closed or refurbishing, one week after New Years... Autopia, Alice's Labyrinth, Faire Tale Land and The Little Train of the Circle come to mind.The ones open were really good, with special attention to Space Mountain, Buzz Lightyear, Tea Cup and the Big Thunder Coaster.However, without the help of the staff to create the environment, it was not enough for 73 euros (USD 90) each.",0
"I have always been a fan of the Disney Organization. We go to Disney World a lot because we live on the East Coast and it is much closer. This time we decided to give Disneyland a try. Disneyland has two parks in one. the Magic Kingdom (an older version of the one in Disney World) and California Adventure. We were not impressed with the California Adventure. It is just like any ordinary park. Nothing special or magical about it. Disneyland is okay but nothing like Disney World. The stores used to be spectacular, but now they are just cheesy souvenir shops. The new  Tower of Terror  ride doesn't even compare to the one in Disney World. I think old things are sometimes better than the tacky things we construct nowadays. I don't mean to put down the park. It had it's good things too, like Soarin' the new ride in California Adventure and Autopia. I would not steer clear of Disneyland if you are in the area, but keep in mind it has some flaws.",0
"We arrived at Disneyland on April 9. We stayed at the Grand Californian which is pretty pricey, however we have stayed there several times in the past so we knew that part. What we did not know was that Disney has now offered their annual pass for the locals more affordable. You can pay for it over a 12 month period of time. The place was packed out miserably. The sewer system at both parks had issues so you were constantly smelling sewer. Their were 80 minutes wait for the popular rides. The Resort was filthy and the service bad. We have been to Disneyland about 6 different times and will not go back. Disneyland has made changes that are not acceptable.",0
"The only other Disneyland I have been to is in LA, and the one on Hong Kong Island disappoints by comparison. It is quite small and the rides are quite old. it was more geared for very young kids rather than tweens. There is certainly nothing wrong with that however it is very hot walking around there in June and they were not all that many rides for adults which was a little disappointing",0
"Having been to many amusement parks around the world, this is probably one of the less exciting ones for young adult travelers though there are plenty of offers for kids.   One day pass was definitely enough!",0
"Always wanted to see Disneyland and when I had the chance, Christmas Eve 2018, I was disappointed. Maybe if I had been 7 and not nearly 70 I might have enjoyed it more. I expected to see a lot more characters and not be confronted by closed exhibits.",0
"The park is clean of course. Rides are fun, but there were long waits for just about everything. I'm talking 45 60 minutes. In February. And fast pass system is worthless. You have to be at ride location to get one. Then come back to ride. You spend whole day crisscrossing park to fully utilize. Better plan   a tiered process. let people do this online in advance of visit. That way people who are trying to really see the park can plan their day and not be frustrated. Then fast pass for day of visitors for anything that's left. Then for locals who are just going because they live close and can go whenever. I would pay extra to plan in advance. ",0
"Big park. Not near as big as the original. But very good size. Very long ques at all attractions. The most popular over 1h 2,5h waiting time. And you have to be there before opening time to get fast pass :(. Food... Normal park standard.. Service is bad. So few park people to help. Not all cassiers were open in the store. Few signs and informasion places. Waiting time at the entrance to the attraction was often very wrong....",0
"Nice place to go with kids, very beautiful and stuff but it's a small copy of the Disney in USA, so if you have already been in the Disneyland there, don't waste your time, otherwise it's a good shot.",0
"If your planning on doing Disney do it right and go to Florida. I Visited the Parris Park with High Expectations which sadly were not met. If shopping for fridge magnets is your thing then its great there are 10 shops every half mile all selling the exact same stock. The Food wasn't so bad there were lots of carts selling Ice Creams and lollies which was handy and in the cafes a lot of the staff spoke at least basic English again very helpful. It Disappointed me that at the time I was around 14 (so not a young child e.g. toddler) and the characters found this enough to refuse to sign my book after waiting patiently for 35 minutes in a queue as there were younger children who had been waiting 15 minutes. This happened repeatedly. A lot of the rides were closed on the day I visited. the ones that were open were pitched at 5 6 year olds so not suited. I tried but could not find a information centre to help me find something to enjoy the day there (Not saying there was not one there just hard to locate) The only two points I did enjoy were the Big Pink castle to have my picture taken with it in the back ground and the show put on by the characters, get there 1 hour early if you want to be able to see anything!Overall if you have very young children e.g. 3 4 then this may suit you but anything over the age of 10 11 it is worth paying the extra and going the whole way to Florida.",0
"The press are stating the park looks rundown. That isn't really the problem imo.  Fewer people are spending on meals and in the shops so the park makes its money by letting way too many through the turn styles. You could barely move on main street, it was pointless waiting in a good spot for Dreams & the parades as people just barge you out of the way once it started. It was only thanks to EMH that we got on some of the rides. The only meet and greets in this park were in roped off area's or via meals. We didn't mind as we stayed in HNY so saw characters there but would have been annoyed to have queued for the princesses or paid to meet them over dinner only to find them out and walking round in the studios. We also saw pick pockets operating in the queue for BTM on the weekend. Christmas dreams is amazing and some of the shops have lovely things but the park needs a good re think or less people so everyone can get on the rides.",0
It is average place. I visited Euro Disneyland and this one does not have anything more attractive. Long queue and not all games have fast track.,0
"If you are young (or young at heart) you will love Disneyland. I've seen it grow and change over 40 years. It's definitely not what uncle Walt had originally. There used to be a ticket book and you'd only get a couple  E  tickets. E tickets were for the very fast exciting rides. There were rarely long lines. Today, you can ride whatever you want, just not when you want. There are crippling lines for most attractions Wait for a couple hours, ride the ride for two minutes, then get back into another line. If you're young, maybe all the waiting is worth it, but for a senior like me, it's not so great.",0
"Smaller than WDW Florida, but still fun.   Happy to see the selfie stick is banned from Disney Parks. Security was a little high with bag checks and metal detectors.",0
it was too hot and we didnt have a fast pass   but its a great place and i recommend to stay 2 days and then do more,0
"Visited in early Jun with family. It's too much hyped, though few things like parades and shows are good. Taking photo with Characters are really frustrating and that to in hot sun. You have to wait for hours. They should have few more characters roaming around for photo pose.2 rides in tomorrow land and the roller coaster in adventure land were closed.",0
It has been 20 years since my last visit and I have been to Disneyland 5 times in total. This time around I was really shocked and disappointed with the huge crowds and very long line ups. Everything was just way too busy and with huge crowds it just isn't enjoyable. The restaurants are packed and there are line ups for everything. I also did not like the new pay for photos. And having to be checked before entering Disneyland is a real sign of the times (very sad). I think only a certain number of tickets should be sold each day so people are not over crowded and can enjoy the attractions. And I am also surprised that so many people try to jump the line up. It is a shame that Disney is so greedy. I would never return.,0
"So, we planned to visit Disneyland Paris, and because my wife and kid were eager to spend quality time, we booked a hotel in the area, not in Paris. First day we went to the village, it was ok but we were not impressed by the shops or restaurants. The airship and little boats were closed because of  strong wind  and it wasn't windy at all. We wish it was because the weather was hot. Next day we went early morning to the studio and the park. Few things1  you cant tell much about each ride before you go into. Difficult to know which ones you like. My kid didn't want scary stuff and by mistake we went into 2, not knowing till too late2  I bought Gopro specifically to take videos of the rids. That wasn't allowed and although it was easy to still do so, I respected the law but was deeply disappointed3  The rids themselves are like 3 10 in terms of attractiveness. If you take the characters out, I am sure non of the rids will be attractive by itself4  the worst thing that happened was at night. We specifically wanted to attend the show at 11:00 pm. We went back to the hotel and came back 10:50pm, not realizing that we forgot the tickets. So I quickly jumped into the car, brought the tickets and arrived around 11:08. And guess what, we were not allowed to enter. You can have rules and regulation, but this business is about full experience of mostly  one time  visitors . It was us and an other family trying hard to enter, but no luck. That was the most important item in my wife's  to do  list and we could have at least seen the last part of the show. We wouldn't have made any difference in the closing time because we would for sure go out once the show finishes. It might be few minutes late from the closing time, but it meant 50% of someones vacation. Anyway, i share part of the responsibility, but the staff could have done better to put a smile in my kid's face without causing anyone any tribble ",0
"Renowned name but almost like an average amusement park to me.If they are famous for renowned cartoon characters, also they will be criticized for non systematic arrangement of rides and showing characters for photography with the visitors. All the characters are standing on their different points at the same time. How one person can take more than one photograph with the characters at the same time? They are standing on different places which are far one from another.Well appointed park.Nice parade on two times.But entry fees are too expensive.",0
"went for my daughters birthday and she really enjoyed it. this was our second visit our first being about 9 years previous, i was a little dissapointed in the the overall condition of the park, it had the feeling that it needed a make over  felt a little tired, toilets smelled. many of the rides seemed to have either broken cars or seats that you couldnt use. i have visited florida severall times and the parks there seem so much better.",0
"Stayed on resort at Hotel Newport Bay, second visit, the first time was in 2001 and although the reception , bar area etc looks ok our hotel room was tired from 10 years of use, our 6th floor room with balcony opened onto the front of the hotel and between the constant arrival and departure of buses and noise from some form of large extraction unit below our room, it was not possible to leave the balcony doors open, which combined with a broken air conditioning unit in the room, made for some uncomfortable sleeping conditions.( The air con was fixed once reported ) The room was supplied with a coffee machine but 6 euros for 3 sachets meant it was unused for the duration of our stay, as was the contents of the mini bar ( 3 euros for a Mars Bar!! ) we upgraded to the Admiral floor when booking and when we picked up our complimentary tea and coffee we were given enough for 2 cups, when questioned we were informed that this was for 2 people for the week!! Luckily we had taken coffee sachets with us and this helped a lot.The hotel as expected at this time was extremely busy and this resulted in long queues for breakfast and a general scrum for the continental style food, however the food was fine and the rolls,ham and cheese came in handy as snacks in the parks later.Thankfully my children were old enough to give the characters a miss this time but many a parent stood patiently in long long queues in the hotel foyer for the obligatory autograph. The walk to the park around Disney lake is still enjoyable but watch out for the pot holes and worn paths, particulary at night, easy to twist an ankle, I dont reacll those 10 years ago! We noticed a light fitting that had come loose from the side wall of the bridge as we walked in the morning and it was still there that night! The parks are what the parks are and yes we expected them to be busy at this time of year, but wow there,s busy and there,s busy, huge queues to enter the parks, for rides, for food,toilets even ( women using the gents due to the length of the queue!) and finally at the end of a long day even queues to leave the parks. The fast pass system was also under pressure with a 20 minute fast pass queue for Big Thunder Mountain on most days and on several occasions we were given fast pass times 5 hours after swiping our tickets.We experienced a number of ride failures with the biggest culprit being Big Thunder Mountain ( 3 times in 1 day ) not funny when you have queued for 70 minutes with two fed up teenagers breathing in cigarette smoke from people on both sides of a winding queuing system, ( Disney needs to extend its non smoking policy to include the rides along with the hotels,restaurants etc.) Space mountain,Phantom Manor, Buzz Lightyear and the Carousel also all had technical difficulties during our stay. The cost of the visit is expensive but Disney seem intent on extracting every last Euro ( 2 Euros for a spin in the train around Disney Lake, the 6 Euros for the Hotel Room Coffee, 12 Euros for a 10 minute trip in the balloon !) but the cost of food in the Disney Village and Parks is generally prohibitive and be prepared to select your dining times with military precision to avoid long delays and more queues, we snacked at lunchtime and then bit the bullet in the evening and ate either in the park or the Village, and comfortably spent on average 140 Euros on feeding a family of four with a drink or two each. This will be our last visit to the attraction ( 3rd time in total ) and unfortunately for us the magic lessens with each visit probably due to the children growing up, familairity etc but unfortunately my overiding memories of our stay this time will be:  An ageing hotel, long long queues, expense and the need for Patience,Patience and more patience!",0
"Everything Disney does, Disney does in Disney grand style. You will notice the quality and attention to detail immediately. The park is fresh and well kept, and the staff keep it fun for everyone. It was VERY CROWDED when we went on a rainy day in July    we found everything in Paris to be this way at this time of year. I was with my 12 year old son, and we had a park hopper pass. We spent one day there and I found this to be plenty. If you love Disney merchandise, there is no shortage of that. Lots of places to eat, sit and people watch.",0
"Being a big kid we first went to Disneyland 18 years ago when I was pregnant with our son. 8 years later we took him with us and had such a magical time we stayed another three times staying at the Cheyenne (ok but you fight for a table at breakfast) once and the New York twice. By the last time, two years ago we felt that no effort was being put in by Disney to keep the magic alive and our most recent trip, a day trip, confirmed it had sunk lower. I know that there is money to be saved in the current climate but surely Disney doesn't have to cut back quite so much. Rides were closed, catering wagons were closed, restaurants were closed. The one we knew was a good deal (the chuck wagon) had changed its menu which is expected but a meal that used to contain half a chicken is now reduced to a turkey drumstick and you have no chance of a burger without sauce as 'it is impossible'!! I know it was November but if you've paid to go you expect it all to be open. We always go in November, usually the end of the first week and the Christmas theme is usually in full swing with festive music, carol singers etc but this time the Christmas decorations were sparse and their just didn't seem to be any atmosphere. The magic has definitely gone for me and I doubt we will go back. Shame.",0
Well this place good when go with kids in week end.   When I was there just they open indoor not out door because of storm.   I would say it's okay that's it.,0
"Great theme park, children fun, overcrowded, you queue for ages on most attractions..Disney prices are not for the faint hearted!",0
"I've been to all 3 Disney Parks    Florida, California, and now France. This was my least favorite. Some of the really fun rides for kids   Mr. Toad's Wild Ride and Alice In Wonderland are walk through attractions rather than actual rides at this park. However, Pirates of The Caribbean was amazing, possibly better than the other parks. As I read elsewhere, indeed the bathrooms were quite smelly compared to other parks I've visited and this was the only park where visitors have to be reminded not to smoke on the rides (I actually just found this humorous). In this  non smoking park , the designated smoking areas were completely empty because people smoke wherever they want to, so if you are horrified by smoking, you'll probably need to get over it before you ever come to Europe. One of the biggest improvements over the USA parks    the beverage selection    beer and wine are served at some restaurants. Overall, the Disney magic is still here and I don't want to be too critical because I love Disneyland and my niece had a lovely time, but I can't help compare my experiences with the other Disneyland parks and for me this left a little bit to be desired.",0
"Disneyland is a spectacular theme park. The rides are top notch and the grounds are lovely. Whether you will have a good time, however, is entirely dependent upon the time of year that you visit. We just returned from a couple days at the park in August 2009. It was so crowded that it was not even enjoyable. Walking anywhere was like being stuck in a can of sardines. Everywhere you looked there was a mass sea of humanity, with plenty of pushing and shoving going on. It would easily take 30 minutes just to get across the park because there were so many people there. The wait times for most rides were from 1 2 hours.The FastPass system works great, but only a handful of rides offer Fastpass, and for those that do, you will frequently find yourself getting a ticket to come back in 5 7 hours in order to ride. We were not able to get Fastpasses for some rides because they were all gone before noon.We arrived at the park at opening time, and it was great for about 45 minutes. We had to wait no more than 10 minutes for a ride and could easily walk around the park. However, by 9 or 9:30, the wait times climbed up to 30 to 45 minutes per ride and by 10:30, you could expect to wait an hour or more.If you want to truly enjoy Disney, come when it is not so crowded. If you must come during the summer, be prepared for a long day of waiting. Plan out everything you want to do and stay on top of your Fastpasses.",0
"Unfortunately the fact that we did go during summer holidays, on a very hot day and queued for approx 1 hour per ride took away much of the expected joy and excitment we were expecting on our first visit ever to Disneyland. Also, we can only assume it was due to the heat but we hardly saw any characters walking around and only found one person to swop a pin with .Whilst we had planned to do California Adventure the next day we chose not to due to our first day experience at Disneyland.On a positive note the fireworks display that night was fantastic.",0
"I made my way here by train which is easily sign posted. You will have to switch trains at Sunny Bank station but the Disneyland train is right across the platform. If you have been to any of the Anaheim, Paris or Tokyo Disney parks, this one is very similar but on a smaller scale. I went on a particularly hot day so have lots of water and a fan. Be prepared for long waits in lines: for rides, for food, for restrooms, for water (you get the idea). Also, heaps of people trying to push in which is particularly annoying on a hot day and you have someone trying to push past you. Just stand your ground   I tried to play nice and be courteous but by the end of the day I was stopping small children in their path to pushing in front of me. There are only two rides that have fast pass (which was a little disappointing). Word to the wise: if the ride has solo riders, line up there. The line for solo riders was only 1 3   1 2 the wait time of the other line. I felt a little let down because I have been to be other parks but it would still be great for first timers or families. The staff were still great, the magic is still there and it is still Disneyland but just be aware and you can still have a great time :)",0
Their fireworks show is trully magical!!! (One thing I really enjoyed in HK disneyland). Their attractions and shows are for kids.,0
"This is what I sent a few minutes ago via Eurodisney contact form, just a look...Dear Sir or Madam,I've just returned from my annual holiday which included a trip to Eurodisney a couple of weeks ago.Unfortunately I must say that was the lowest point of this year's holidays, and if it wasn't for my daughter's smile (after all it was her first trip to Eurodisney) I'd say that it was a complete waste of money.The tickets (2 adults   1 child) cost me 255 Eur which included both parks for one day but come on, be honest who can see both parks in one day?!?!? Also please don't give me the excuse  oh you could have bought the fast track access...  because those cues were long too.It all began when I promise my child that she would see the most beautiful doll house in the world (the  It's a small world  attraction)   closed! And the website didn't say a word about it nor did the travel agency know something about it.Further on a train station also closed.As if it wasn't enough the Pirate of Caribbean Ship was closed too.Oh yes the Pocahontas... hummm... yes you guessed: closed!Once we got to the Haunted House (Phantom Manor) next to the Mississippi Boat, after another cue, we entered, passed the elevator bit, and when we were almost entering the boots to visit the attraction... the system crashed! Lights on, and another 30 min waiting for the system to  reboot .By the way, the maintenance of certain bits throughout the park could be improved.Another one, milk! Yes, my daughter is 6 and it was more of an adventure to find milk within the premises than actually to wait in one of those cues. Finally I found  milk ... Well powdered milk... That is not proper milk! I'm sure that you will not have your budget sacrificed because of getting proper food. Overall the menus were more like fast food and sweets than real, tasty, healthy(er) food.One final issue. Portuguese is one of the top 10 spoken languages in the world (number 6 according to http:  www.ethnologue.com statistics size) but there were NO available translations at Eurodisney, whereas northern european contries for instance, that don't even appear on that list, have their language translations available.Eurodisney opened in 1992, I think some of these points could very well have been taken care off.I've been 6 times to Eurodisney for several reasons, the first one in 1995, and unfortunately I must say that instead of getting better with time is getting worse.Regards,Afonso Marques",0
"So, the attractions are still great. Service though on this park is horrible. Unfriendly, slow and just plain incompetent. Most rides are also manned by very inefficient staff, who could really do a much better job in filling the rides and thus reducing the queues in a big way. The kids had a fabulous time, so that helped. But one cannot help wondering why this park is loosing money. The path to profitability should be via price rationalisation (versus     5 for a small beer), friendliness (train the staff), and efficientcy (train the staff).Still think it was a huge mistake to put this Disney resort in France...",0
"Although out of season   I was not told when I booked this trip that several of the rides etc would not be working. I understand the need to maintain but we should be told what is not available. No peter pan ride, no train running around the park and many others also closed. Pirates of the Caribbean still excellent and the Blue lagoon restaurant still good with great staff. The staff at the park all seemed happy and friendly.",0
"I took my 14yr old son to Disneyland and we had two full days there. Disney itself was pretty average as there aren't many adrenaline type rides there to make it exciting. Space Mountain was by far the best but with queues being 75mins long rides were scare. This ride broke down for nearly a full day and the Indiana Jones ride was a 2 1 2 hr wait even though the sign said 1 hr. It also broke down when we were right at the front of the queue after waiting 2hrs! Use the fast passes, definitely helps with the waiting times. Best time to go is 8am in the morning, worst time after 3pm. The park was parked which became very stressful and with many people from different cultures , with an emphasis on one in particular, having no personal space boundaries, it was pretty stressful.California Adventure Land was by far the best. Great shows, much more relaxed atmosphere and great night parties in the Hollywood area of the park. Awesome.",0
"Visited for 3 days with two boys aged 3 and 6. Stayed on resort and booked with half board which I   d recommend if you   re going to stay at one of the Disney hotels. Reasonable value, although still expensive for what you receive but sort of works out better if you want to eat in resort. both parks had enough to do and rides for both boys who aren   t the tallest 3 and 6 year olds. ",0
"I've been to the Disneylands in Tokyo, California, France and Hong Kong. In terms of the grandness of the four, HK comes in last. In terms of queue time , shortest. In term of friendliness, bottom two. You don't really see the staff smiling here...to me, that is a pre requisite. It's Disneyland and staff are supposed to be warm and smiling and.... U get my drift. Lots of mainland Chinese who love to cut queue but there's nothing much u can do except to tell them off. Was also disappointed that the classic theme ' when you wish upon a star' was non existent at the entrance. That always prep my mood when I enter all Disneylands. Of all the castles, this one is the simplest and shortest as well. ",0
For kids who are looking for rides with a little thrill this place leaves a lot to be desired. Overall not a great place to visit but been there done that may apply.Food is expensive and service is lacking. Very difficult to find a young person smiling outside of the performers. The other thing is just a heads up. Many of the rides or exhibits that have voiceovers don't have great English. We could barely understand which detracted from the experience. Not complaining just worth noting if you are expecting all communication to be understood.The lines were not that bad but we went on a Friday.,0
"While I would say this park is a little smaller than Disneyland in Anaheim, CA, it is on par as far as the attractions go. I did not see anything unique to Paris.My one observation is that I have never seen a Disney bathroom in such bad condition. We have been to 3 different parks now and I was very surprised at the paper on the floor, big puddles everywhere, broken toilets. The park was not crowded at all, so I could not see a reason for this.Also, the food venues are not as plentiful as other parks I have visited. The park was not crowded but all the sit down restaurants were fully booked and many of the walk in places were closed and sparse.",0
"My husband and I visited the park over New Year with my son and his family. We had bought a package that included the Eurostar Train and Newport Bay hotel.Transport was excellent I can't really fault that. The hotel was fine, we were not in it that much.Things got off to a bad start upon arrival at the park where very little help was available for locating our hotel. We ended up walking through a security checkpoint and part of the park to get to the hotel with a long walk. Quite difficult with luggage and two small children. Upon arrival at the hotel and a long winded check in we made our way to our rooms. These were quite nicely furbished, comfortable for our three night stay. Comfortable bed with nice pillows. No tea coffee making facility though! A TV that we did not use, multi function plug sockets in the dressing table which were a good idea. The hotel is being refurbished at the moment so there was scaffolding outside our window, these had plastic coverings so no view over the lake or balcony access. The rooms were like ovens and my son was unable to open any windows. Thankfully our windows opened. Breakfast was included, a fairly basic continental style selection but adequate.The park itself is quite a walk from the hotel there are shuttle buses available but we chose to walk to save the scrum of getting on a bus. Entry to the park was through a security checkpoint where bags were scanned. Initially I thought the park kind of resembled Disneyland Florida but on a smaller scale however I soon came to realise the inefficient French Disney was a bit of a disappointment. My biggest criticism was that no one seemed to care. It was unfriendly, not the same atmosphere as Florida. The place was rammed with people. Queuing was long for everything with some very short rides at the end of it. Thunder Mountain was closed but most others were running if you had the patience to q for an hour and a half or more. There were rides for little ones but considering the amount of queuing and the short rides it was quite difficult to keep them entertained. There were parades that took place and were quite good and in the evening a light show and fireworks over the Castle were very effective. It all had the same content but on a much smaller scale. One of the things that was disappointing was the lack of Disney characters around. They made appearances in defined areas where you could q to have a photo with them but none wandered around. There was a meet the Princess visit for which a massive q had to be passed through to get a photo with one. I felt that the place lacked the  Disney Magic  that I had felt in Florida. All in all the children did enjoy the visit perhaps me as the adult and having been to Florida noticed the shortcomings more so. If unable to travel to Florida I guess its the best of a raw deal.",0
We got our tickets from Australia before we left. We had trouble getting in but the customer relations team was extremely helpful in sorting it out.We got the 1 day 2 parks pass. As during the time we went the parks are open later there was more than enough time to do both parks. I felt that this original park really needs an update and that it has been let go. For very young kids it is good but that's about all. We found that the studio park was so much better. If you have not been it is a good day out but do not have overly high expectations. They really do need to upgrade the street parade. We used the metro trains to get there from the city. Very easy.,0
Hong Kong Disneyland as I think is the smallest Disneyland in the world. Its very crowd and everything need to queue for an hour. The price of annual pass is increasing but its better can go on weekday which not crowd as weekend. The games are nice but begin dirty now,0
"It is true what they say; the place is magical and takes you back to your childhood. The queues however suck the life out of you and to me this probably suggests that demand has outgrown supply. There were a number of the larger rides closed on our visit including pirates, big wheel and california screaming which put additional pressure on other thrill rides. We had the fast passes but even with the we probably still only managed 8 10rides max in a 12 hour visit : ( this was a weekday not even at the weekend which is presumably worse. Best ride was the mattahorn and it was cool to go on this after dark",0
Took my kids 10 & 12   definitely not as action packed as the one in LA... Probably better off if u have younger kids.  Wasn't crowded at all so lines weren't an issue.  If u have older kids head over to Ocean Park.,0
Magical world for kids.  The best part is the fireworks at the castles.  But it is too small. Half day is more than enough for this place.,0
"I've been in Disneyland in 1974, 1977, 2004, and 2015.Since it's been 60 years old (it was founded in 1955), I see many attractions under construction.It was not like this until 2004.Until 2004, every attractions perfectly were in operation.For instance, Disney castle, Rail Road, Matterhorn Bobsled, Splash Mountain was not working and were under refurbish in February 2015.Rail Road operated on the third day, but disappointingly the dinosaurs went vacation.I understand since the 60 years have passed. But many people are disappointed in the fact that they cannot enjoy their favorite attractions. So please do the maintenance beforehand promptly.",0
"I didn't spend too much time, only around 3 hours, mainly because I took photos with the mascots (Mickey, Minnie, Pluto, etc) and the queuing time for each of them took about 30 45 min on a particular weekday. The rollercoaster rides aren't THAT extreme, but still, please do empty your stomachs. Lots of souvenir shops. Half an hour before its closure, LOTS of visitors stationed outside the castle just to watch the beautiful fireworks. Not a bad experience but staying there around 3 hours is sufficient",0
A great park but why close main rides at one time To take teens and have Rock n roller coaster and big thunder mountain and star tours closed was so disappointing as one of the main reasons for the visit and no pre warning or would have deferred the visit That a side it's a magical place and we loved the other rides especially small world and space mountain The parade was magical and fireworks fantastic Staff so helpful Would have been a 5 star review if all rides were open ,0
"Well, I guess this is one of those must visit attractions if you are holidaying with kids... or at least for those who are young at heart :) Disneyland Hong Kong is quite some way out of the city, requiring more than 30min on the MTR depending on where you start your journey from. However, the special coaches on the Disney MTR line is quite a nice touch.It is not a very big park, but I suppose you get the usual suspects in what a Disneyland entails. Don't bother bringing your own beverages as they are not allowed into the park. Food prices in the park are generally pricier than those in the city, and there are plentiful of food you can get within the park. The rides are, well, OK I guess. Nothing too exhilarating except maybe for the new  pirate ship  ride in the Toy Story land. Stay on until 8pm at night to watch the daily fireworks display over Sleeping Beauty's castle, that's probably going to be the most memorable thing to remember your Disneyland visit by but remember to grab yourself a good vantage point a little early.A full day's visit would probably be sufficient, I don't really see the need to spend a night in one of the hotels in the park unless you really want to take things slowly. All in all, an enjoyable trip nonetheless, especially for the kids of course.",0
"Having been to Disneyland in California and Disneyworld a few times, we couldn't miss the chance to go to Disney Paris. It's OK but not up to their usual standards. It didn't seem to have the Disney  buzz  and excitement that we were used to. Not the same enthusiasm from cast members that we have come to expect. Almost an attitude of indifference Very little music playing throughout the park. Very strange. Having said that, the rides didn't have long lines at all the day we came, so that was a bonus.",0
My family and I are Disney people and I go as often as I can. This might end because of all the changes that are happening. The prices are going up and the hours are shorter. It is harder to get around because of all of the construction. The rides are great and I love the firework show. ,0
"Always enjoy my time at Disneyland and California adventure, but we made the mistake of going on a holiday, never do that. There were nearly 50,000 people in attendance at the park that day and we've sworn off all theme parks in the summer and around the holidays.",0
I visited Disneyland Paris with my wife and 2 girls in July 2015 and had a good day overall but did have some issues. No. 1 issue is the queues. Ridiculous. I know it was peak season but they were sooo long and it was sooo hot. Food in the restaurants was average and quite rushed. Had to queue for restaurants also. The queues were so bad I don't think I would go back.: (,0
"This review is from the point of view of service, for those who may be thinking of taking the kids there but would rather go First Class. Well I tried and it is almost impossible. If it exists, it is a well kept secret but we went for the top suite which was supposed to give us VIP fast passes and avoid baking in the sun for 90 mins. Well, that only works in 25% of attractions so baking in the sun is not optional, it is an obligation. The food outlets are very average andif you want real food you have to go to the overpriced restaurants that can't be bothered at trying to serve you properly since they know they will never see you again. There should be an option for people looking to enjoy the park and still have more services and comfort. Go with very low expectations and a roughing it mood to survive the experience.",0
"I have been to this park a couple of times   it is just OK   if you have never been to Disneyworld & have nothing to compare it to. It is pretty run down and needs some serious modernizing and updating. I like the classic feel of the park   but it is quite small   they can clean it up and update it without losing the old feelingThere is not a lot to do   if you have ever been to Disneyworld in Orlando, FL the parks are huge in comparison to this one   and there are 4 of them   not just oneI would recommend for anyone who loves Disneyland to make the trip to FL to experience DIsneyworld if at all possible. It is an ever changing ever improving network of parks. Even if you have the annual pass (which we do) and go often   there is always something new and exciting going on.",0
"First time at Eurodisney and disappointed with the lack of appearance of Disney characters. We were there for 5 days but could not get on a third of the attractions as either shut or queues too long   up to 1.5hrs. Food very expensive, visited Cafe Mickey and table was not very clean. Toilets were not very clean in the parks and smelly. Not a magical experience, Florida is far superior. Would not visit here again, there is no atmosphere. Stayed at Davy Crockett Ranch, accomodation was very good.",0
After visiting Florida Disney World three times it is hard to have anything that will live up to the one in Florida. We love Disney and the magic spirit it creates. Hongkong Disney is very small. We went over the part in 6 hours so buying more than a 1 day pass is not necessary.If you just love to walk around and feel the atmosphere this is perfect.,0
"The que for rides can be very large, and their are only a few fast track rides but you can only get 1 fast track ticket at a time which wastes a lot of your time standing in a que and with young kids this can be a bit of a nightmare.",0
"We visited as two adults and having been to Disney in Florida I expected the same. Whilst the park itself was beautifully maintained it is quite small and is geared towards children. There are only two or three rides that are suitable for the older 'kids'   the run away train and Space Mountain. Don't get me wrong we had a good time but it wasn't like Dreamworld in Aus which is suitable for all ages. The optimum age would be anywhere from little children to young teens.As two adults I probably wouldn't go back unless we took our child with us. You can definitely get around in half a day easily.Couple of things that were disappointing, many of the restaurants were closed and some of the sections were closed or closing early for the day.",0
"Before we went I knew that many rides were closed. So instead of going on a Sunday I went on a Monday since the tickets were cheaper. We were there from 10 am to 4 pm. Unfortunately it rained all day. However thanks to the rain, the queues were short and we were able to do the Autopia, Buzz Lightyear, Its a small world, Indiana Jones and the temple of peril, and Pirates of the Carribean. The longest queue was about 30 minutes. We spent about 1.5 hours at the Inventions restaurant at Disneyland hotel which is wonderful. I highly recommend spending more and booking this restaurant, especially since I heard that many eateries were closed and food is bad and expensive. If you are paying for expensive food might as well go to the best buffet with no waiting at all. If you have children, they will love the Inventions restaurant. We did not bother queuing up to meet any characters, since at the restaurant the character come to meet us!",0
Went with our 10yr old on what we hoped would not be a rainy day. It is a nice park and easy to get round. We went mid week so the queues for the rides were quite small and there was enough variety to keep her interest. We arrived about 1 2hr after it opened and we had about 4 1 2hrs before it started to rain. A few of the rides were kept open and only lightening made them stop completely. We stayed till the end anyway and saw the fireworks but the parade was cancelled. If you get there when it opens & stay the full day I don't think you need more than a day to get round but if it's busy and you have young children 2 days might be better.,0
It was extra busy this year. We come the same time every year. We love Disney. I will say this year the employees are not as friendly or alert of the really excited kids. It is a little disappointed. You can tell it has come all about the money ,0
"I would strongly advise against going to Disney in the winter. Although the my daughter had a whale of a time it was freezing, very wet and quite frankly depressing. The queuing times were ridiculous especially having small children out in the pouring rain. We waited 3 hours each time and only manged to see two Disney princesses. The food is extortionate and we found people working there to be very rude!! I would consider returning in the summer time but I think we will just save for Florida!",0
"Wear walking shoes, prepare to stand in lots of lines, and bring plenty of cash.",0
Expected to meet Mickey but so sad.. i can not take picture with him.. so long queue  and finally just going around the park. one time visit is enough for me.,0
As you would expect in August the park was very busy and very hot. We only managed to go on a few rides. Most of the rides did not seem to have any shade whilst queuing. Good choice of shops and food. Would like to go again when it isn't so packed!,0
"So I've been to Disneyland a number of times since I moved to Orange County and while it has its perks, it's definitely not my favorite destination. For one thing, the entrance fees are prohibitively high and for someone who doesn't do rides, this park doesn't offer much in terms of enjoyment. Given a choice between Disneyland and DCA, I think I'd gladly choose DCA any day.On a side note, I did run the Tinkerbell Half Marathon in February 2011. That was quite an experience, not having to deal with crowds and having the park pretty much all to us runners...",0
It might be me   but I did not find the Park very good.A lot of rides out of order.Very long ques.I went to Disneyland California 20 odd years ago & really enjoyed it   maybe I'm just too old now.I had my 2 teen kinds with me   not much joy there either. The young kids there seemed to be enjoying it.,0
"My daughter has been talking about nothing but Disneyland for months and with the weather in Florida, I ended up going to the location in California. The place is huge! We accidentally entered into the wrong park but they quickly were able to change our our tickets and walk us to the right park so the staff is wonderful. It was very hot as aspected so wish that they offered a little more shade while waiting in the very long lines. We had a great time and the prices for food and beverage weren   t as all as high as I thought they would be so that was nice. I also didn   t know you were allowed to bring in your own food so I will remember that for next time. The only downs for me was first the wait times for each ride. Imagine waiting 45 minutes plus in line with a 6 year old in the blazing fun. Not fun at all lol. So we mostly stuck to the smaller less crowded rides. Would   ve been nice to have been able to get on some of the more popular rides though. The second thing was the characters. I thought we would   ve came across way more characters. And when we did it was like an all out war rushing trying to get to them and take a picture. But we overall enjoyed ourselves.",0
"well had a very bad day at disney as all the good rides were very crowded so didnt get a chance to sit at any ,as after sometime u feel dejected and avoid even trying to be in a line .what i saw was a peter pan show ,haunted house ,aladin place and saw the parade in the evening.if u go make sure its very imp to plan how u gonna go through each n every ride ,that saves time n energy.",0
"Disneyland Paris was fantastic when it opened we have returned every year but so many things losing the magic. No ice show in frontier land . No shows in the theater in fantasy land or discovery land. Electric light parade gone. The show in front of the castle is fantastic but you have to be at the front to see the full show.The prices are now sky high over the top for simple drinks, popcorn gifts etc. We were told that a team from America are coming in for three months to try and pull the standards back up, which i really hope is true. The toilets are not attended as they use to be and sorry to say some of the staff have lost the friendly Disney welcome.The characters used to be in plenty, but now to see a rare glimpse by luck of a princess as they rush by, you have to be lucky or queue for an hour plus not knowing the princess you will see.Don't get me wrong i love Disney but they need to work harder to return the magic.",0
"Little disappointing as we have been to Disneyland in Anaheim and Florida. This one is much smaller and not as many rides, no water rides at all and with being so hot we were all disappointed with that.Other than that just st a miniature version of the real thing",0
"After traveling to Disney World eight years in a row, it was time to try Disneyland. I guess I have taken Disney World's customer service for granted. Everyone from food service to janitorial staff is friendly, helpful, and just plain fun. Their focus was always the customer. I did not find this kind of service at Disneyland. The employees typically were bothered that they had to work. When approaching information for help, or ordering a meal, the employees were usually engaged in a conversations between themselves.Disney World remains the Happiest Place to be, Disneyland   not so happy.",0
Easy train ride to Marne La Valley station then a short walk. Pricey tickets but its OK as its Disney. Rides not too awesome. Got there early at 9 and left at 8 pm. Endless queues if not having an express pass. Lots of time wasted standing and exhausting rather than refreshing. Best is to do a disney holiday ..stay in it and use all the perks. Other wise its best to avoid as there are better theme parks with more thrilling rides.,0
"I enjoyed my time and the family determined it was worth the trip. It was neat to see the difference between Europe based parks and the US. Staff customer service not the same as we were use to with American parks, but better than the resort (Newport Bay). Found the rampant closures of restaurant options frustrating. They close a majority of the quick service to force you to choose the more expensive sit down establishments. None of them advertised, so it made planning quite complicated and frustrating. The price of the food and quality received is quite lacking. The mouse knows how to separate your money from your wallet on both sides of the pond, but at least in the US parks, the quality is a little better.The park was not clean, lots of trash everywhere and staff seemed not to care.Rides were unique in some cases, identical in others. Lots of closures to include the majority of the southwest themed territory and adventure land.Disney Dreams was spectacular and better than American version.Good visit all in all, but nothing attracting us to visit again.",0
"Too expensive , u should wait for a long time for each play, I had to wait 70 min for just one play, although there is just few good plays in both parks approximately 7 plays, it isn't for adult 100% ,,,,,',,,,",0
"Very nice park, has many of the classic rides that have been replaced in Florida, so nice to see the old classics... A few rides need repair, the star tours ride was being held together with duck tape... Walt would not be pleased to see that! The staff were overall quite polite and friendly, however we had a bad experience with  city hall  staff over a disability card. The nurses in the first aid station were very helpful in fixing the problem however should not have happened in the first place ",0
"I am a Disney Parks fan so I knew I had to make a stop at the Paris version during my recent trip to France. Unfortunately this park has a lot less attractions compared to the Magic Kingdom, and Disneyland in Anaheim. I toured the 2 parks and shopping area in one day and felt like I covered everything I wanted to see, to compare when I went to the original Disneyland 6 months ago, I spent 3 days. I also hated all of the smoking. The designated smoking areas are not enforced. People smoke in line for the attractions.I am glad I had the opportunity to visit, but most likely would not return.",0
"We visited Disney yesterday with my two grandchildren, one of whom is autistic. (He is 3 years old).My son had saved all year for this 4 day trip to Disney and yesterday was their first day. He was told at the point of booking that there were special loading points for disabled Autistic people meaning that they would not have to suffer standing in line for the queues.. This is not true!!!! My daughter in law queued up at the customer service building for half an hour when we arrived with all of his paperwork to prove his disability to be told that there were 10 rides throughout the park that would cater for him. And that the line pass only allowed for one ride per trip. This means that in 4 days at the park they can do just 10 rides or stand in queues and suffer a melt down..... And that's exactly what happened. The staff on the rides appear to be oblivious to what Autism is or the trauma causes by having to stand in queues in heat not just for a few minutes but up to an hour per ride and in some cases even more! An now for the second problem... Isn't it enough that people pay thousands of pounds to visit this place without ripping everybody off when you get in there.... $4.00 for a bottle of coke, $3.49 for a bottle of water, $1.99 for a very small carton of milk... $7.50 for a very basic hot dog and lunch...... Lunch of cheese burger and chips x 3 and one children's meal along with 5 x drinks..... $62.95! disgusting............",0
"A bit disappointed this time actually. We got there for the opening and the guy at the gates who checked the bags was quite rude.No massive queues as the weather was hideous. One of the best rides (Indiana Jones) closed, technical issues with another ride and a number of boarded up areas. As one of the guests pointed out there are more places to eat than rides.",0
"We stayed in the New York for 4 days which was good for a family of 4, only gripe about the room was there was no tea coffee making facilities. Food   you expect to pay a premium but felt their pricing verges on profiteering, so on an evening we ventured out to get some value   plenty of good local restaurants if you have come by car   one particularly good French one we found was in Chessy village, only 2 miles from the resort. (Le Table)Parks   having visited both Disney parks in the states previously we were left under whelmed by the Paris one, it just didn't run as slick or have the panache, from the chaos queuing for the rides to the lack of communication when rides were shut, my advice would be to save up and go to the states.",0
"After visiting the park in April over 3 days we could not believe how much thingscost it is a money making exercise. After visiting disney florida in 2007 we had a idea of what to expect, but not for the 1 hour wait to take a 1 minute 30 second ride, and getting wet not all under cover. The plus side was a lot of the disney shows are good and the castle lights show was the best ever seen .We stayed bat the Santa fFe hotel the room was ok but breakfast was the worst experience ever it was like camping plastic plates and a cheap continental breakfast and not enough room to sit down,We will go over the water in future to America",0
I was disappointed with everything in the park. Many of the favorite rides were closed or kept breaking down during our visit. The rides that were running were old and outdated. The food options were not up to my expectations especially for the amount of money they wanted. If you want a great Disney experience do not waste your time in California. Go to Florida. ,0
"The kids love it, but it's exhausting during the summer. First, the tickets are nearly $100 each day. Then you have to stand in lines all day long, some lines being over an hour wait, especially in the summer. If you must go, then go during off season.",0
"Took the g kids to Disney for the first time, on a Thursday,  off   peak  many lines were still 30 mins long. I have a huge problem with adults riding alone on Fantasyland rides. I know they are paying guests too, but this part of the park is really for the smaller kids. Disney needs to institute some system where this is a kids with adults line or kids alone and adults by themselves line and have the kids line go 2x to adults line. The adults can go many other places in the park that little kids can't go. Or they should have a the express for rides in Fantasyland. Asking a kid to wait 30 mins to ride Dumbo is ridiculous when 1 2 the people in line are adults alone!We were very surprised as to how crowded it was all day, it was not spring break, not any travel cycle, it was the 3rd week in April, on a Thursday.We say 2 characters, when I was kid they were all over the park, where did they all go? The kids of course didn't know any better and had an awesome time but as adults we were a bit disappointed for them.The last thing is ALL the transport that would take you around the park was closed. The paddle wheel ride, the train, plus the Matterhorn, Autotopia, and about 6 other attractions. I know they have to do work on rides and stuff but you had a LOT of stuff closed which also contributed to the long lines everywhere",0
"if you're heavily into shopping for Disney merchandise, then this is the place for you, otherwise it really isn't a big deal. always imagined Disney land to be really magical, but apart from a couple of rides, it wasn't at all special. lots of long queues in the horrible heat and humidity to do anything, including say hello to the characters. they don't walk around the crowds, they just stand somewhere while people queue up to have photos with them. the fireworks were really so low that they could only be seen from one place in the whole park which felt like they encouraged over crowding. even the parades generate stampeding crowds. wouldn't go there again, definitely not worth the money",0
"The french need to learn manners and be friendly before they carry on, nothing at all like Disneyland Orlando, much smaller and so so expensive, we didn't have to queue very long for any rides but the french like to jump in front if they can, my grandchildren enjoyed it but they are only 4 and 6. I found the prices of food and the quality to be very prohibitive. I personally won't visit again can't say the same for the grandchildren.",0
"we went to Disneyland in Orlando and wanted to re live this experience in Hongkong, but unfortunately it missed the mark. The place looks ok on the surface but unfortunately you can clearly see that a lot of the stuff probably was built cheaply in China?",0
"I visited a Disneyland at least once a year for the past several years. I feel Disney has cut down the coat in many ways. In the past, some rides offer cool air conditioning when you enter it. The AC was not cool at all specially at Buss Lightyear ride. So many people lined up before the ride. Once you entered Buzz Lightyear building, there weren't air conditioning. The air was stuffy and warm. Retail shops and gift stores are the same situation. You do not feel cool air inside gift shops. Employees are less welcome to guests. Many rides were malfunction during park hours. We encountered late starts at Indiana Jones ride, splash mountain got stuck in the half way. Space mountain were closed for a few hours. These all happened during park hours. Ticket price goes up every year, but we weren't able to get on rides due to machine problems. ",0
"We went with two girls aged 4 and 5. I struggled to understand why I was spending a day in Paris in such a tacky looking place but at the end of the day there is nothing little girls like more than cheap tat and Disney princesses so we put it on the list. The good things: Friendly staff, well maintained (nice to be in Paris and not see dog crap), good attention to detail, Princess meeting was everything you hoped for, pretty small queues (we went on a Monday outside school holidays, max queue time for a ride was 20 mins), lots of good quality rides for little ones to go on. The negatives: price aside the food is absolutely atrocious (if it met Mcdonalds standards they'd be doing well and in France of all places!), relentless amounts of overpriced tat for sale, parts of the park closed and staff levels not maintained throughout the day for what appeared to be economic reasons, meeting Disney characters was quite hard to do.The verdict: It is worth doing but there is way too much to see and do in Paris to want to spend more than a day here. It belongs in the US, not France. Judging by the queue facilities they had in place you'd be crazy to go with small kids during school holidays or weekends as they would only get frustrated at waiting in line all the time.Tip: If you have girls head (run) straight for the Princess meeting as the line moves really slowly",0
"For anyone who has had the pleasure of visiting Walt Disney World in Florida, you will most likely have experienced a visit to Universal Studios. When doing so, you are acutely aware that you have left Disney territory; the rides are broken closed, the place is generally grubbier and the staff are surly instead of jolly. This is, sadly, the experience of visiting Disneyland Park in Paris. We all had a jolly time, and came away with some happy memories. BUT! and it really is quite a big but. The French do not seem to have caught the Disney culture, and in failing to do so have allowed the Disney park on their home soil to be nowhere near as good as it could be. Top this off with a LARGE selection of rides closed (apparent this will get worse over the coming year) and throw in some European weather and the truth becomes apparent. It wasn't a cheap trip, and for not much extra saving we could have gone to Florida where it's done properly, the weather is nice and the staff are ALL excellent!",0
"Third visit this year and will probably be our last. Rides are showing signs of wear and tear and there was a distinct lack of characters compared to our last visit 5 years ago. They have added a couple of new attractions, hotel ride which we did think was very good and also Buzz lightyear which we considered to be very average. Did try several times to get on Crush but queuing time 2 hours so gave up on this one (no fast pass facilility). We felt rides needed updating and were overall disappointed with the park.",0
"when we visited disneyland i always do remember the song  it's a small world after all  played from one of the rides. firstly, it is smaller compared to disneyland, CA and very much tiny compared to Disneyworld. it was on christmas day we got to explore the place. it was a very festive day and a lot of christmas songs played and there were song and dance number presentation at night. we got to enjoy the snow foams that got showered and it was fun. the facilities were okay and the food was okay too. we didn't go to shopping for souvenirs and part of being in disneyland brought our happy thoughts when watching disney movies and remembering it. i was disappointed with the staffs of disneyland and is that they don't speak english at all to tourists for every rides we get to visit. whenever they tried to explain to you or gave you a tour, they just speak chinese. not every tourist that visits disneyland HK speaks chinese. it would be proper to speak in english.",0
"We had 3 days here and on the first afternoon managed only a train trip and one Star Wars ride the 30 minute wait (on a board outside) was nearer to an hour and once in the queue there was no way out. They have a system of fastpasses where essentially you book to come back later even with this system we waited half an hour when we came back, and many of the attractions have horrendous queues but fast passes aren't available or some sell out by lunchtime so you never get to do it  they need a better system! Also the night light show started about half an hour after the parade ended by which time a lot of people were leaving as they were standing in the cold with kids for all that time very poor organisation!",0
"We booked a three day break in Disneyland Paris. My husband has been to the USA parks and I have been to Eurodisney with my kids 12  years ago. It didn't seem as magical this time and some parts looked tired with  a small world  being refurbished into 2016, some areas closed off and some parts boarded off. The queues for the rides were ridiculously long for the length of time you were on them and queues didn't really seem very organised. Staff in the shops were pleasant enough and some were friendly but the ones on the rides and in the park generally did not smile. It's Disney, what's not to smile about?! We queued for an hour to use the train which again was chaotic. The staff didn't speak or acknowledge you and on one occasion, the train was about to leave the station and several carriages had not had their doors closed. Luckily one of the staff spotted it and managed to stop the train   consequences of this could have been quite disastrous as there were children in all carriages. Still no smile from the staff! As Disney is a business, perhaps there should be staff morale training in customer service, see how USA do it and match it. The food at Disney is basic. Each place had different set menus and as long as you like fast food then you would be ok. It was over priced for what you get as having had a meal at Planet Hollywood, we certainly got better value for money there. Drinks are also extortionately over priced but as a captive audience, you had no choice. We took a bottle of squash and bought water, worth it when the weather is so warm.There seem to be a lot more shops than I remember, clearly aiming for parents grandparents to spend the money   make sure you take plenty as it doesnt last!This summer they are promoting Frozen with a parade which was Horse and carriage with Elsa and Anna   that was it. I think the size of Frozen they could have made more of it which was a shame. The 5.30pm parade was lovely and all the characters were out in force, well worth the wait. The park had notices of what time it closed and we sat for over an hour waiting for the firework display to no avail. Quite a few people got up and left as we did on the first night as sitting on a concrete floor isnt great! The second night we waited til the last minute to watch them but it was a very long day getting back to the hotel well after midnight.Overall, we had a pleasant three days but t was certainly long enough. There wasn't enough to keep us there any longer and I would think twice about going again, perhaps save for the USA experience.",0
Not going to write a full review on this as thousands will have but if I'm honest I'd fly the extra or go to Florida. It's the original but the replicas are better,0
"I get it, it's Disneyland and people are expected to pay a high price just to say they've been there. From the 5 buck Churro, the 10 buck corn dog that takes 30 min in line to the waffle corn ice cream on Main Street that takes another 30 min to get. If you have little ones who are impatient, I suggest going elsewhere. We used to have the annual passes and would come 3 times a week and the lines would be maybe 5 10 min max and have dinner at Napa Rose. Now it doesn't matter what day of the week, people are everywhere around Disneyland. My Kids hate Disneyland simply because the lines are so long and they can't even walk around without getting struck with a stroller. They are 5 and 6 and would rather go to Universal Studios or Legoland than come here. ",0
This is our first time visiting the    ghost house    in Disneyland during Halloween. We bought the night ticket and entered Disneyland at 7p.m. We waited for around half an hour to visit each ghost house. The ghost house is not very terrifying; suitable for elder children    it took around 10 15 minutes to walk through the ghost house. The night parade is exactly like its television advertisement. The children were excited but it is not that attractive to adults. Firework at the castle was amazing; it starts at 21:00 every night. The music and firework cooperate to create a wonderful memory for visitors.,0
"If you've not been to Disney World, you still might be disappointed!Very tired place, not a patch on Florida. Cigarette butts, litter and cracked paint are in most of the memories from Disneyland. It could be great, but it just isn't.Transportation to the park is very good, with a train station right on the doorstep. The Disney market place area isn't very nice at all. I'm sure there were designated smoking areas, but most smokers seemed to just walk around the parks with cigarettes on full display, choking passers by.To be fair, there were a few impressive areas of the parks, but they weren't enough to compensate for the rough parts.",0
"The park is quite dated now and in my opinion the studios park is better. It had some great Christmas shows and better rides With an age range of 4  65 everyone was entertained in both parks though.Take you own food like others suggest as the food is poor and expensive. We took a flask for hot drinks which was much better than standing in long queues. Make use of the fast pass tickets as these do save time in the parks. We were lucky we did not queue too long for most rides. You just need to plan well as to what you want to go on. If you have little ones that don't want to ride the bigger rides make sure you get a baby switch ticket as this means you can take turns without queuing up twice. We used this for our 7 year old so they don't need to be babies! BEWARE OF MIS INFORMATION BY STAFFWe purchased a Discovery Annual Pass last year and were able to get a 20% discount as we are a family of 6. It cost 119 Euro per person. Beware if purchasing these as there are a lot of blockout dates (most of the kids holidays) and you will be blocked out for 2 days after purchase. We wanted to add the parking option for an extra 40 Euros but were advised in the annual pass office that we could not use this with our Motorhome. Normal charges per day for a motorhome are now 45 Euros a day. Were were told that instead we would need to pay only 10 euros a day. This seemed strange but we checked with the member of staff at least 5 times to confirm this was true. Low and behold when entering the car park we were told that we needed the car parking option to enter for 10 Euros so the lady who sold us the tickets got this completely wrong as we could have added the parking!! Prior to a return visit in December I emailed to check that I could add the parking option to my pass when we arrived as we were taking the car this time and parking is expensive. They confirmed this would be no problem. The day before we visited I went to the annual pass office to add parking and was told it would be 70 Euros now not 40 as the price of the ticket had apparently gone up and I had to pay 30 Euros to make the ticket up. (this is a lie as the price for a discounted ticket is still showing on their website at 119 euros!) I tried to explain to the staff that it was not my fault as I was mis advised when the tickets were first purchased. The members of staff were so rude and just kept telling me to move away from the window as they did not want to resolve this. In the end I paid up as it was too much hassle to argue as they just do not want to know. They told me that car parking was 25 euros a day when it is actually 30 euros so there is clearly a pattern that they have absolutely no idea what they are talking about half the time! Well on trying to enter the park my Annual Pass would not work as when they had added they parking they had issued a new ticket so my pass was now blocked out for 2 days!! Absolutely fuming as my pass was blocked out for 2 of my 3 days visit. I had already had my blockout days before. No chance of resolution on site as the staff just dismiss you and do not want to know, they are so rude. On complaining to DLP for blocking me out they offered me 2 food vouchers (we are a family of 6) Hardly much compensation for ruining our family holiday. Will I be back to use the vouchers.....NO ! They did refund the 70 euros for the car parking but I would never have added parking if they had told me this would happen. We will not be returning now as the parks need revamping.",0
"We've just stayed at Disney for the Disney Halloween party and have been left feeling sour. Although the park is beautifully decorated, has attractions for all ages, plenty of photo opportunities and atmospheric, paying additional to stay on the evening of Halloween is not worth it. Firstly staff were not equipped to deal with the crowds that they had and staff were both rude and uncooperative.You couldn't move for people. Queues were bordering 2 hours wait each so you couldn't really do much. Due to the amount of people you couldn't find seats anywhere. You couldn't even find somewhere safe to stand still because of the amount of people pushing you around. What you are paying additional for: a short Disney villains parade, a disco, a Halloween themed light show on the castle and having your photo taken with a Disney villain at the princess pavilions. During the day though security is tight. Airport scanners and bag scanners are mandatory. Prices as usual are high for everything, however you do find the occasional item on sale. Characters and their attendants are fantastic! If you don't book during the French half term you are fine. Half of our break was during their bank holidays, and the place was stacked with people. Now the French are back at work and school you can actually breathe. The park boasts some fantastic rides (Hollywood studio having the best ones) and some unique restaurants, but to fully enjoy the park you need lots of money and a bucket load of patience. ",0
"I can't count the number of times I've been to DisneyWorld but family brought me to California for the weekend. So we had to visit Disneyland. First of all, we couldn't find the place. Terrible signage. We arrived early in the morning as we usually do. It was strange walking down Main St to find such a small castle. We went on as many rides as possible here and at California Adventure. At times, when rides were the same, i.e., Soarin' we didn't know where we were. It was very strange. We spent an entire day between the two parks and probably won't return. We saw very few characters and came across cast members who did not have the same spirit as those in Florida. Don't get me wrong, we had a good time, but it didn't feel like Disney, especially at Paradise Pier. It seemed like just another amusement park. At night we got fast passes to World of Color. We were told we were in the red section, which was a good thing. We were told to arrive around 7 for the 8:00 show. We went in and there were no seats! Totally not Disney like. Is Disneyland the proving ground for attractions? Do they try them out there first then move them to Florida and get it right? I guess if I had never been to Florida it would have been ok, but I guess I'm just spoiled. Sorry. ",0
"After visiting Walt Disney world in Orlando 3 times we expected Hong Kong Disneyland to be on those same lines but unfortunately we found the park to be quite small compared to the one in U.S.A., nevertheless if you want to enjoy a fun day with the kids I would recommend getting a one day pass as you will have enough time to explore the park .",0
"A complete zoo, anger people, long, long, long lines. Fastpasses gone by 10 am for the day.  not a fun day",0
"It was my first time to Disneyland and I guess my expectations were too high (I've been to Disney World five times). I thought the park was in sore need of a refreshing (at nearly $100 a head, I know they have enough money to afford the supplies). The paint seemed shabby and a lot of rust was showing on the ride fencing. Also, I did not feel the vaulted Disney friendliness from the staff like I do in Florida. Maybe this was due to Disneyland seeming more like a regular theme park instead of an  experience  like Disney World but come on! If I wanted a regular theme park, I could have gone to any Great Adventures. Since I was there with my daughter (3y.o.), I didn't get a chance to ride several rides but I could tell that the lines weren't long. The food was typical theme park quality and mediocre at best (why can't they do a hot dog like Costco!). I won't make an effort to return.",0
We found it too busy and the queues ridiculous especially with young children. Quite a lot of the rides were out of action which for the price paid was not really very good and there were not many places to get drinks etc,0
Fun but hot and VERY crowded. Very long waits for rides. Got stuck on a ride for an hour. Staff was rude to their stranded visitors (barking commands). We were promised water that never came. They gave us a couple of fast passes to rides we had no interest in. Loved the rides we were able to go on. ,0
"We have visited Disneyland Florida and prepared ourselves for the fact that this resort was going to be on a much smaller scale. I kinda liked this as you could go from park to park easily and pop out to Disney Village for a snack. However, I had expected there to be a similar level of Disney sevice. This was not the case. The parks were dirty and the toilets were smelly and blocked. At one point I thought the toilet was going to overflow when fushed and made a hasty exit. In Florida each toilet had a cleaner permanently on duty constantly cleaning. The park was supposed to be no smoking but no one seemed to care about this and staff didn't enforce. We got fed up walking through walls of other peoples smoke. What really took the biscuit was when we were going into the park and the chap in front of us was putting his ticket through the machine whilst holding his cigarette in the same hand. He was having difficulty and needed assistance from a staff member, and still nothing was said. This led to cigarette butts all over the park along with other rubbish. The staff seemed disinterested when you asked for assistance, and that was if you can find one. The retail staff were not courteous and please and thank you were rare, After the fireworks on New Years Eve the bus terminal was a nightmare. The old ethos of Europeans not knowing how to queue was evident in abundance. When the bus came some idotic woman shouted 'push' and the whole crowd pushed towards the bus. Adults gave little regard to children in the crowd and there were sobbing kids being crushed into the bus. The terminal staff didn't give a damn and cared only about forcing the bus doors closed. My daughter & I were separated from my husband and after our bus left the police had to attend to a kerfuffle which broke out when three Germans went to the front of the crowd. My daughter's arm was caught in the door mechanism as it shut. There is going to be a serious crushing incident here (have they learned nothing from Hillsborough?). Had a decent queing system being in force this could all have been avoided. There were plenty of buses so with a little patience every would have got on eventually. However, a quality lost on the Europeans we encountered. It put a dampner on an otherwise pleasant New Year.",0
"We have been here a couple of times and thought the atmosphere around Halloween was amazing so we had high expectations of Christmas time. I think because we had been to Orlando we are now disappointed with the atmosphere and scale of Disneyland. So many people, not a lot of Christmas decorations and songs and the rides were too long to wait for. If you are contemplating between this and Disney World, I'd take Orlando for sure. ",0
"Disneyland was the epitome of cleanliness, customer service and quality. Everyone knew that when you went to Disneyland, you would be treated to an experience that was absolutely bar none   one that no one could compete with. Well, Knotts, Magic Mountain, Universal Studios, your time has come because Disney has let down it's guard and rested on its laurels for too long. I won't post all of my pictures of us being escorted from rides because they broke down. I also don't have access to all the fast passes that were wasted as we stood in line waiting for rides that broke down   we had paid an extra $10 a ticket for that privilege). If any other business had this many faults, flaws and mechanical failures   the public would lose their minds   but Disney continues to allow these breakdowns to occur without any recourse from public opinion. I researched other forums before posting this   amazed that the fans allow it, and even justify it when someone asks if all the breakdowns are the  norm.  Walt, please send your park employees a message from the beyond, mechanical breakdowns would have never been acceptable when you were running the show and at a family trip that costs $1,000s of dollars now, it still should not be a constant occurrence. Sure the park is magical, especially during the holidays, but it's not when the lights come on and you see the inner workings of these rides, trudging up and down Thunder Mountain or in the back of a Fantasyland ride   then, it's just sad.",0
"The new Cars Land is awesome, but there are people tripping and climbing all over each other. They were filming a commercial to attract more people. Isn't there a fire code limit?The rest of the park was great and the lines were reasonable. Disney has high standards, but I can't understand why the food is so bad. But what can you say? I will be back next year",0
We went on a Saturday which is apparently one of the busiest days! Rides were good but some booked out. Definitely get the fast pass and use the App. Didn   t wait for the parade as it was so crowded. If going with younger kids I would go to this park early before it gets so crowded then to California park. ,0
"I have just returned from a great 4 day stay at the Hong Kong disney land hotel.A bit expensive but well worth it Went with my wife,daughter and 5 year old grandson.He actually had his fifth birthday at the hotel and the staff gave him a royal time.Disneyland itself is a lot smaller than the one in USA but is easy to get around for older and younger .If you allow two full days in the park it is better because you do not have to rush.Not many queues and no pushing.Did not have any trouble getting water in at the gate and there are plenty of taps to refill your bottles.All in all a great trip.Barrie Clarke",1
"Traveling with elderly great grandparents, this was their first time in the park. They enjoyed so much here! The presentation about Lincoln was amazing. For way back then when it was made, that was quite cutting edge, and the content was remarkable. We were challenged by all that was said.We did also go on many rides including the obligatory small world and paddle steamer. We had a great time!",1
It doesn't matter how old you are this is one of the happiest places on earth. Plenty of great rides for the thrill seekers and rides and lots of other things for those of us with weak stomachs. Be prepared to queue and allow a few days to cover both parks as you will want to catch the parades and fireworks (summer and weekends). All Disney staff are friendly and helpful and the characters are great with the kids. A lifetime of memories!,1
"After reading a lot of mixed reviews on Disneyland Paris, I was prepared for a poor second cousin to the US parks. As the title says, we were pleasantly surprised and found it a very beautiful park. Whilst we noticed a few standards slipping compared to the US and Japanese parks, it was nowhere near as noticeable as we had been led to believe. All but one CM was friendly and helpful and we didn't experience the queue jumping or smoking in lines that others complain of. Food is more expensive than elsewhere in Paris but this is the case in every Disney park and we generally only ate one meal there or in Disney Village.We were there during a very quiet week and had walk ons to almost all attractions with no need to use Fast Passes. There are several rides slightly different to the US parks and some completely new ones. We especially loved all the walk through attractions which are unique to DLP like the Taniere du Dragon (every castle should have her), Alice's Curious Labyrinth and Les Mysteres du Nautilus. Adventure Isle was lots of fun to explore. The park is well spread out with lots of room. The parade was excellent and the 20th celebration Dreams Show was spectacular and one of the best I have seen at a Disney anywhere. If you enjoy the US parks then I would be surprised why you wouldn't enjoy DLP.",1
"I want to go back. I took my daughters but I think I had more fun! So much too see, I recommend going for 2 days at least. Yes there are queues but every wait is worth it. I would use fast track next time and be there as the gates open. ",1
"Wow, you ought to be child again and enjoy this place. Need to go to every ride and every zone. Spend time with your family, friends, kids. Be a kid again and just chill. Amazing experience",1
"Visited in 2010 and 2017.The magic never ends, this place is truly amazing in every part of the park. The illuminations   fireworks at 10pm was AMAZING. Well worth staying on for (take a thick coat   blanket though as it gets cold). My only groan about this place is that ALL food and drinks are soooo expensive. Please review your prices for drinks, snacks and stop ripping people off. ",1
"We   ve just got back from a 3 day trip to Disneyland Paris with our 6 year old son, and we had the time of our lives! I   ve read a few negative reviews about Disneyland Paris on here so was a little apprehensive as to what to expect. I needn   t have worried.We travelled from St. Pancras on Sunday 5th April, on arriving at St Pancras you get a Disney pack for children, it was a good start as my son loves colouring in and drawing so this was great, as was the 3 piece brass band that was playing Disney tunes at the station. Travelling time once you   ve got on the train is only about 2    hours and whilst on the train the Disney reps give you a tag for your luggage so when you get to the station in Disneyland you just hand your bags in and they get taken direct to your hotel and you can pick them up once you   ve checked in. This allows you to go straight into the park as soon as you get there and not have to bother sorting out your hotel check in until you   re ready to do so. The reps also give you a guide to the parks and your tickets as well. Once we   d dropped off our bags we went straight to the Disneyland Park, it   s a really well maintained and beautiful place. Clean and tidy and it really adds to the magic of Disney, we walked around a bit and saw the sights and went on a few rides but all three of us were quite tired so we decided to retire to the hotel (the Santa Fe     see separate review for details!) via the shuttle bus which runs every 12 mins.On our second day (6th April) we got to the park really early, well, 08:00 to take advantage of the magic hours, this really was a superb benefit of staying in a Disney hotel as we were able to get on rides like Space mountain with just 10 mins of queuing, the Buzz lightyear ride (which we went on twice!) was just 5 mins of queuing as was the excellent Star tours ride, the other rides which are more suitable for my 6 year old little lad, i.e. the teacups, the Dumbo ride, the carousel and rides like it   s a small world only took 15 to 20 mins to get on anyway. We also went on the train that takes you round the outside of the park, this was also an enjoyable experience, we hopped of it in frontier land and my son got his photo taken with Mickey, Minnie, Goofy, Pluto and Woody, he was thrilled to bits! He also got his photo taken with Donald Duck in our hotel lobby (another advantage of booking a Disney hotel).We then went for a quick bite to eat and yeah, it is expensive to eat in the park, we went to Casey   s hotdogs on Main Street which cost us 10 euros each for a hotdog with fries and a drink, but the hotdogs are massive so we didn   t mind too much to be honest!! And let   s face it, it   s not every day you get to go to Disney so I don   t mind paying these kind of prices once in a while, and there   s a McDonalds in the Disney village if you want to eat cheaply.We then went for another walk about and onto a few more rides and watched the parade which was excellent. We left the park about 20:30 and had really enjoyed our second day there. On the third (and unfortunately final) day 7th April we visited the Walt Disney studios, and were rewarded with another fun filled day, we started off with the spectacular stunt show, this is a must see if you visit, the skill of the riders and drivers has to be seen to be believed! We also went on the Armageddon special effects experience which although loud was superb. After that we went on the studio tram tour, this was thrilling as there were various special effects which were quite unexpected but very, very impressive. I.e. when the lorry bursts into flames and then thousands of gallons of water pour down to    put them out   . A favourite of my sons though was the    Cars    ride based on Disney   s film    Cars   ! If you think of the teacups ride in the Disney land park only with cars instead you   ll get what I mean! He loved them and we went on a couple of times because the queue was only about 10 15 mins! We also went on the flying carpet ride and quite a few others as well, in this park my son got his photo taken with buzz lightyear and Emile (Remys older brother from the film Ratatouille!!) which he absolutely loved especially as Emile seemed to be a little bit of a show off crowd pleaser in    real life        we then left the studios park and went over to the Disney village to have a look around and also get a bite to eat. After all this it was time to reluctantly go home, but it was a fantastic three days, with great weather and great memories that will truly last a lifetime for all 3 of us.We   ll definitely be going back again soon.",1
"Well, after visiting Walt Disney World in Florida four times in my life (three at their Disneyland Park equivalent, The Magic Kingdom), despite this being my third visit to California, my father had a conference at the nearby Anaheim Marriott, and it was just a 15 minute walk to the front gate. I went on a Thursday in the summer, meaning moderately large crowds. It was cloudy during the first half of day, but cleared up in the afternoon and evening, and temperatures were warm but not too hot, ideal weather for experiencing the Magic. I arrived at 11:00 AM and stayed until 8:30 PM, missing out on the short lines of the morning and evening, sadly due to time constraints and needing to eat a late meal. Still, despite the $110, it was still worth every dollar to experience. No wonder it still remains cherished to this day, as the day before I visited, I heard on KTLA (a local news station) about a gentleman who had visited the park for 2000 consecutive days! That said, being a Southern California resident would help with their annual passes to save some money, but alas, that's not for me. That said, this is the real Disneyland park, despite the five other locations that have opened up with their own layouts. It contains more attractions than the Magic Kingdom (over 50, and when the new Star Wars land opens in 2018, over 60), and being more compact means that it's less of a strain to walk. You really need at least two days to see every attraction, and another to factor in parades and entertainment. I like how certain rides that have been retired from other parks, like Mr. Toad's Wild Ride and the submarine ride are still present. While I was there, I rode Space Mountain, the Astro Orbiter, the fun Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters, the Finding Nemo submarine voyage, Jungle Cruise, Pirates of the Caribbean (MUCH better than the Florida version), The Haunted Mansion, Splash Mountain, It's A Small World, the Snow White, Alice in Wonderland, and Mr. Toad dark rides, and finally The Matterhorn, the only ride ever completely designed and planned by Disney himself. I also visited the Main Street Cinema (if you're a fan of The Price Is Right, don't miss a couple old songs once used on Race Game and Switcheroo), the shooting gallery in Frontierland, a short summaritive film on the Star Wars films, and browsed through a couple stores on Main Street, including an interactive machine where you control Pinocchio, set to  I've Got No Strings  (just be a good boy, don't smoke, and don't bear any false witnesses to others). The only food I ate on site was Redd Rockett's Pizza Port, and honestly, it tasted more like Sbarro, but it wasn't too bad after riding Space Mountain. Also, look out for the occasional celebrity sighting, as my sister encountered a reality TV star. There is just so much other stuff to discuss regarding to entertainment, rides I rode on, or what I missed, that I highly recommend joining a discussion forum. Still, despite being so close to the crazy freeway traffic, I still felt transported into another world when visiting. I also had no issues with the FastPass system, and the staff of course were always friendly. The longest I waited for a ride was the Nemo sub ride at around an hour, so I'd recommend doing that early, or better yet, at night. With good timing, I waited less than half an hour for all the other rides. Still, definitely a place to take my own kids whenever I have them. The End",1
"I can't fault this place, minimal queues, rides all working, lovely surroundings. The staff are friendly, and the patrons are not all trying to barge you out of the way. This Theme Park could be used as an example to EuroDisney especially",1
Took our one year old granddaughter for her first triip to the Magic Kingdom.  This park has something for all ages and is always great fun.,1
"Loved it for the 3rd time in 6 years! This place instantly brings a smile to my children, my wife and myself. I love the music, atmosphere and just about every aspect of the park. The food and drink prices are outrageouse, but if you don't like it bring your own water and leave to eat your meals.",1
What an amazing time had at Disneyland   took family (2 children aged 10 12). There was plenty to see and do. The crowds were constant and way too many people bring strollers   so it can be a challenge to get around.Queues at rides varies   but most seem to move quickly. The rides are short   but fast. This helps move the lines along. Plenty of food options but expect fun park prices. You are of allowed to use selfie sticks in either park but plenty of staff are happy to take your photo for you. Would recommend the hopper pass   enables you to move between Disney and California park. Only real negative is that they don't operate a  hopper  line   so each time you leave on park to go to the other   you have to line up again at the main entrance   this was rather frustrating when the whole point of the hopper pass is to move back and forth. ,1
"One of the things I loved about Disneyland was the attention to detail and being updated often. Some details have gone downhill lately, little things maybe most wouldn't notice. Lighting out in some of the rides, some things had been rubbed to the point of deterioration, dirt on things etc. Walt was a perfectionist and wouldn't open a ride if it wasn't 100%. The employees have lost that luster and smile attitude too.",1
"If you've been to Disney World, you'll be surprised at the size of Disneyland as it's a mini version. It still has many great rides, shows and parades though, so the family won't be disappointed. You'll find California Adventure Park across the way (walking across a big sidewalk) and Downtown Disney right there! There are no ferries and monorail needed. It's a great day to spend with the family here. You can see both parks at the same time.",1
"Had a great time in Disney land HK. The kids and teens loved the Star Wars roller coaster. Lots of walking, wear comfy shoes! Easy to get there by MTR.",1
"We love Disney and will continue to return. I still feel like a kid and have as much fun as ever. The Fast Pass route is the way to go, to get on the rides you want. My only complaint is the disabled access line. In almost every case, these lines have turned into a line for overweight people not the truly disabled. It's embarrassing to be American and see this happen",1
"Had gone here during the summer month of July. The park was awesome great rides, atmosphere and crowd. However, it started pouring heavily, and we got completely drenched. They shut off the rides as a result. Later they resumed the same but some of the rides remained shut throughout the day. So advice to check the weather before going. Its a great time for kids as well as adults especially the Disney characters and the parade are awesome cant say enough about the fireworks, its a true delight and a must watch.",1
It is simply a magical place. We had a great week. The characters were fantastic and the rides suitable for all. Food is good but expensive but you can bring your own food into the park. The buzz light year ride is a family favourite and thankfully the queues were not too long. A few things were shut which is disappointing but they have to be fixed at some point. We cannot wait to return ,1
We stayed at one of the hotels for 4 days 3 nights and yes to be able to see and do everything in both parks you need about 3 to 4 days. There are many perks to staying in one of the hotels in the Disney village one of them was being able to access this park earlier than others and we were able to be fast pass to rides that are known to be always crowded such as Indian Jones and Big Thunder Mountain. Don't buy water instead bring along an empty bottle and you can fill at one of the many water fountains in the park. Take a couple of snacks with you in case you get hungry and its very practical as you eat while waiting for your turn on a ride(so not to miss anything). Try to take a place near the Le Ch  teau de la Belle au Bois Dormant(the castle) as soon as you can in the evening to get the best view for the Disney Dreams show.,1
"It was our first visit for us Disney mad fanatics from the UK, having visited Euro Disney and Disneyworld several times before. We weren't disappointed! A bit smaller than Magic Kingdom at Disneyworld, more on the scale of Euro Disney in France. It even had added bonuses of extra rides, like matterhorn bobsleds and Alice in wonderland. The only problems I can think of are quite generic throughout Disney Parks, long queues, expensive food etc. Get there early in the morning, the park is much emptier. Make use of the fastpasses, otherwise in the summer it will be difficult to get on the rides.",1
"Had a great trip...been several times before.On this visit decided to buy annual dream tickets for the wife and myself.These tickets cost more but have loads of benifits .a lot of the concession stands were closed which was strange as park was real busy.Only real gripe was people walking about the park smoking,signs up saying smoking only allowed in designated area.",1
Disneyland is a dream true for every person. We spent an entire day in the park and covered almost everything. It is always busy and would suggest to start as early as possible. You should not miss the Fantasmic show at the end of the day here. Totally its a dream come true Fantasy Land.,1
"A small version of Orlando with subtle Asian influences that are necessary,  balanced, subtle, and work well with a mostly American theme park experience.",1
"The film nerd in me was in heaven, walking the nostalgia and footsteps of Walts designs and dreamscape. It was a thrill to see it each day even after the initial excitement wore off.Service lives up to its reputation, with cast members friendly and helpful on the most part (even when the shops were closing and they all wanted to go home and we were still queuing to pay!) it was my birthday and I received more birthday wishes than ever, with many CM's sincere as chatting with them they were fascinated by tales of England and the royal baby! Service infinantily superior to that in Disneyland Paris , my regular haunt.We were there for a grad night   not as awful as we had been warned it could be, the Sunday was worse.We utilised the Fast Pass system, without it, wouldn't have been as successful. Whilst my next Disney fix will probably be Florida, and I don't see myself heading back to Disneyland unless visiting again nearby, It doesn't mean it wasn't wonderful.",1
"Disneyland Park is awesome! It might be on the other side of the globe but is totally worth the 14  hour plane trip. There is so much to see and do, even if you don't go on a single ride. Try the pineapple dole whip float and check out the parades and fireworks. If you do have time for the rides, check out Indiana Jones, Star Tours, Buzz Lightyear, Winnie the Pooh, Pirates of the Caribbean, the list goes on. If you go at a busy time of the year, try and get there as the park opens to minimize your time waiting in lines. You should allow at least three days to explore this park, but we could easily spend a week there without getting bored.",1
"I have been to Florida's Walt Disney World multiple times (30 ). So I was anxious to see what was the same different about Disneyland. I went in convinced that I would not like it as well as it's Florida counterpart, but after visiting I have to say it's a solid tie.Like better: The lines! I'm not sure if we were there on an off day, but we waited no longer than 15 minutes in any line. Some of the more popular rides like Indiana Jones did have long wait times, but we just got fastpasses for those and had a wait as short as any other ride.Like better: The ride detailing. Pirates of the Carribean is at least a fourth longer than the one in Florida and now I know why everyone harps about the Florida one. The lighting in there is a bit better too, you can actually SEE the skeletal pirate steering his boat without straining. The drop is more intense as well. The clock at It's a Small World is AMAZING when the clock stikes every quarter hour. The one in Florida, cute, but no comparison. I also like how Disney characters are incorporated into the dolls of It's a Small World here. That's something you don't see in Florida either. I also like the extra detailing of the Haunted Mansion with the lightning windows as you approach the doom buggy's. I know that in the sealed room, it's always been said that the floor goes down in one, and the ceiling up in the other. I always thought the ceiling went up in Florida. A little jolt on the floor as the room began to stretch in California confirmed it.Like better: Nostalgia. Some things that are just memories in Florida can still be found here: Snow White's Scary Adventures, Mr. Toad's Wild Ride, and the Penny Arcade machines on main street (My son loved those) although I 'think' the penny arcade machines were simply relocated to the train depot in Florida.Didn't Like As Well: Tom Sawyer Island, which is known here as 'Pirate's Lair'. The fort was closed. Not sure if that was a permanent or temporary thing, but my kids love the Florida fort.Didn't like as Well: Fantasmic. Here, it's a standing attraction, kind of like the parades. I do actually like the Peter Pan aspect, as we don't have that in Florida, but being able to actually SIT in Florida and not have to strain to see over other people's heads or around trees or lights makes it a much better experience on the East.Didn't Like as Well: The Castle. Just didn't. No offense Disneyland fans!Didn't Like as Well: How shall I say this? Less magical, or less 'fantasy'. When you leave Disneyland, you're back in the 'real world' in a few steps. In Florida, you have to drive miles from the parks and most of the resorts to do that. More of a feeling of really being away from the 'real world' in Florida.Again, love Disneyland and would like to have a repeat visit someday!",1
"First, the transportation to HK Disneyland was very good. Our trip was on a Thursday which might be why it was not that crowded as we were dreading it to be. It was a sizeable crowd still but the lines   queues were manageable. The attraction was great. The parade and the fireworks was just funtastic! The only theme park we were not able to visit was the Mystic Point but our 4year old had a blast with Princess Elsa and Anna. Also had her picture with Buzz Light Year. The shows were also very entertaining like the Lion King and Mickey Mouse (  Donald Duck's) magical show. Our daughter loved the Donald Duck's show very much.The food was on a high side but we thought it was reasonable compared to the other HK attracion (OP). The serving was nice at the Star Liner. Three meals would have been enough for us 4 Filipinos of 3 adult and 4 yo.I was worried about the transportation after the fireworks given the big crowd but the MTR was very efficient. Wow. I have been making reviews and  MTR was very efficient  was always in it. It was just great.We will be returning to HK Disneyland for sure. Maybe make it a 2 day next time and just forego with the other theme park down south. ",1
"The disney park is magical, and will bring out your inner kid! The theming can't be faulted, every little detail has been thought of.There are a range of rides and shows to suit everyone's taste.Make use of fastpass to shorten waiting times, especially for Big Thunder Mountain!",1
"Long lines to meet the characters, but worth the wait.Not as fun for people who enjoy thrill rides as say California Adventure but if you're not looking for that then its an awesome place to spend many days!! (lines are super long for most rides so take advantage of the fast passes and go early and stay late.",1
"Growing up in Southern California was a lot of fun. It was always a treat when the folks said let's go to Disneyland (Yeah!!!). Back in the 60's you'd buy a book of tickets and always were sad when the E Tickets were gone. Later in life my wife and I would get the Annual Pass so we could go when we wanted to and we did use them a lot. We used them to the point people working there recognized us. When people ask us what do we like better, Disneyland or Disneyworld? We would alway reply, One is not better than the other just different yet exciting. If you go to Southern California, make it to Disneyland you will not be disappointed one bit.",1
"Everyone knows about Disneyland, but maybe not about how to enjoy it if one's disabled. If you have any type of disability (mental or physical) be sure to pick up a brochure at Guest Services (located at City Hall) that explains the many accomodations Disney has in place so that everyone can enjoy the park. Also ask about a Special Assistance Pass that you can show to Cast Members on each ride. I'm a 63 year old who relies on a walker to get around. During my recent trip, I was pleased that so many of the attractions were accessible to me via an alternative queue or ride car. The only attraction that I found not accessible was the train station at Home Town Square. But I could board the train at any of the other three stations. Disneyland has gone out of its way to think about the people who were young at the same time as the Park was young. Both Disneyland and us baby boomers are aging gracefully together.",1
"I live in San Diego and dont live far from the first Disneyland, This park feels smaller and does not have as many rides. But as a Disney fan it was worth seeing. The food prices are not as bad as i expected was able to get a hotdog fries and coke for about 10 euro. Talk to some of the cast members they are really nice and can explain things about the park most dont know. ",1
We felt like kids! First experience at a Disney. It truly is magical. Everything is themed! From the toys to the food! Was disappointed about the castle still being under renovation. Also take note of the times to get your picture taken with the various characters around the park. We were too late to get our Mickey and Minnie picture. The food voucher was well worth it. Food portion was large. Drinks are expensive but you must stay well hydrated for the amount of walking that is done. We did not use the fast pass as the park was not very busy. The shops are amazing and have the cutest items to purchase. Had to control ourselves! The parade at night was so much fun. We wish we had stayed over for a night in the resort to complete the park but overall it was an amazing experience!,1
"This is indeed the happiest place on earth for kids but not so happy for adults. Why? get ready to pay high price for everything from parking, food, souveniers etc... The lines were long for the most popular attractions but surprisingly fast for the kiddie rides. So much to see and do in a day that I doubt you will ride and see all the attractions in the same day. I recommend to get a 2 day pass if you want to experience all the rides at this park. ",1
"Am sure everything that can be said has already been said about Disneyland. Fun rides, big crowds, long lines but all work to give you the Disneyland experience. Kids love it, parents and grandparents love the way the little ones enjoy themselves",1
Have been here almost 30 times in my life and am so excited to finally get to share it with my kids. My husband and I have taken our kids 4 times this last year and we really enjoyed it. My oldest son is over the moon for this place. Excellent customer service. We are planning on coming back very soon and can't wait to have a fantastic time. ,1
I'm the same age as Disneyland Both since 1955!!! I had so much fun today!! I walked around & just soaked it all in!!  I renewed my Southern California resident Annual Season pass.  The lines were not that crazy.. can't believe for Summer!!,1
"2 of my friends treated me to a 3 day trip here as I never went when I was young. I can honestly say it was the most fun I've ever had on holiday! The theme park was perfectly run, everything is paid so much attention to detail. The rides were fantastic, the whole atmosphere is just so unlike anywhere I've been before! I felt so relaxed and detached from the real world I could have easily stayed longer! I wouldn't hesitate returning especially with children. However, this is definitely not just a place for kids! Adults will love it! We didn't stay in a Disney hotel, just somewhere on the outskirts, so I can't comment on their accommodation. The only downside is the queuing times   my advice would be to take your own pack up and water and you'll be fine! We visited in July and the queues could have been loads worse   the most we had to wait was 1 hour but mostly it was lots shorter than this. Also, beware of queue jumpers   we found ourselves making human walls in queues to prevent this from happening! Overall, I would 100% recommend a trip here   there's something for everyone and it's just brilliant!!!!! ",1
"Having been to the Disney parks in Florida we have always been keen to find out what the Paris ones were like.Out of the 2 parks there is far more to do in the Disneyland Park and at some of the places you could almost be in Florida. The rides were good and the parks were well kept and while we were there is was 30 degrees so it really did feel like Florida.I would advise that is staying in a Disney hotel to take advantage of the extra hours on the Disneyland park as we tried in Walt Disney Studios but they did not open their gates until 10.00 and then it was a mad scramble for Crush's Coaster which in view of the hype was actually quite disappointing.Be prepared for people pushing and shoving and smoking everywhere, the cost of food and drink is extortionate so have plenty of Euros ready. We enjoyed some of the set meals in the parks fast food restaurants we shared platters that cost    12 and found there was plenty to eat for lunch and in the evenings we ate in Disney village. The best was the Rainforest cafe which at    20 was not cheap but worth it for the good food and experience, Annettes diner served good burgers but they were vastly overpriced but then Disney has the monopoly.We were there for 3 days and felt it just enough to do the parks and rides, it was expensive but good and we hope to go again one day.",1
"The park is easily accessed from central Paris. Go to 'Nation' on line 9 (green) and get on the larger train out to Marne la Vallee and it takes you straight to the park. As with everything Disney, it is 100% all in! The atmosphere and surroundings are amazing as are the staff friendliness and helpfulness. The park is manageable in a day if you stay from open till closing. There are fast pass available if you are good at planning to be a set place at a set time   I however am not and just waited in the queue! The bigger rollercoasters were around 45 minute wait and the meet and greet were an hour wait roughly. However this is to be expected on a summers day. There are unlimited options for places to eat in both Disneyland and the studios park next door. Stay for the parade at 5.30 pm   it's fabulous! If I were to go back I would see Mickey Mouse and the princesses first when it's quiet as they had huuuuge queues and try plan fast passes for all the bugger rides! Overall amazing experience and I am certain I'll be back! ",1
"We went on New Years Day, the California Adventure Park was not crowded at all. We were able to get into all the rides we wanted without much of a wait. We then went into Disneyland and found a slightly larger crowd but nothing like what you would think you would find on any given weekend or holiday. Again we were able to get on all the rides that we wanted that night and we were able to get good spots for all the parades. Unfortunately the fireworks could not be seen because of winds. We had a wonderful time with our granddaughter before taking her back home to her parents.",1
What a great place to visit.  It is obviously more special for young kids that teenagers but we enjoyed it all the same,1
"We went to Disneyland Hongkong in the month of September in year 2013 and I must say it was a very nice experience especially when you are with the kids. Kids really love this place. It was very hot and humid though so we just could not bear the heat. One has to wait almost for an hour in the long ques to take a ride on a swing. your kids can get pictures clicked with the famous disney characters. water and food is very expensive inside. Even the Disney toys are damm expensive but you wont get them outside, so just grab it if your kids wants one. There are few free water coolers so you can get your water bottle refill. In all a nice experience but choose the best month to visit Hongkong else get wet.",1
We loved everything about it especially the Halloween decor at the time we went. The firework and light show is amazing. There are Ques for everything so patients is a must also wear comfortable shoes and use the fast pass facility where you can. If your going at halloween book the halloween party as we got to go on most things that night with less ques.,1
"Just back from a trip to Disneyland Paris, 4 adults and 4 year old daughter and we cant fault a thing.The staff everywhere were super friendly and helpful, the weather was kind and even most the the queues were short. Worst was Princess Pavillion, you have to queue for a ticket and then queue again your time slot   probably nearly 2 hours added together but worth it when my daughter got lucky and saw Auoria   her favourite.The parades were amazing, we ended up watching the main one three nights as it was so good.laser firework show was brilliant and well worth staying up late for as it was not on until 10.30.If you are staying at a Disney hotel you will get access to the park and a few rides at 8am   really worth doing this as we managed to go on rides with no or little queues.",1
"We have been 3 times now and will go back again at some point, we always have an absolute blast when we visit. The staff have always been friendly, polite and helpful and at time sincredibly patient with my special needs boy. We absolutely loved the new frozen parade got some brilliant photo's and both me and the children equally loved the new frozen sing along show at the chapperell theatre definately amazing memories made with the children. I am guessing visitor numbers were up this year on what they were last year because it was manic at times haha if it is going to continue being so busy they may need to give a little more thought to crowd control during the disney dreams show, all relatively good while stood up but then a load of people stood further back insisted on shouting at us up front to sit down. The staff asked us to do this, except it was uncomfortbale and near impossible given that there were so many people by the time the show started that space for sitting down properly was very limited. this was not something we experienced last year. The crowds for the buses at closing were immense although the bus company are clearly very aware of this fact because they had set up queue lines to each of the doors to try and minimise the free for all. Best thing to do is to leave the park before the dreams show or to wait a little afterwards and take another bus, again this was not something that was as much of a problem last year. Other than that we had an amazing time, we even managed go get reservations for the princess pavillion, we had already met cinderella the year before and this year we met belle. The look on my sons face was priceless, worth every minute of the wait in the queue in sweltering heat to get our reservation cards. We even had an amazing treat one day when walking down one of the sides of the castle where there is a wishing well, i looked up only to see most of the disney princesses just arriving at the auberge resteraunt and when i point it out the kids completely freaked with excitement lol We even saw some of the characters we hadnt seen on previous visits including mad hatter, alice, hook and smee.",1
One day isn't enough for my kids to explore and ride on all the attractions. It was still manageable for crowds and queuing during a weekday. Just get used to the loudness of the PRC tourists wherever you go. It be great if some of...More,1
"Had a lovely family break for 3 nights, 3 days. Stayed at Disney's Sequoia lodge which was lovely. Room and hotel were clean and within walking distance from the park. We didn't have a time to use all the hotel facilities such as pool etc as made most of time in the parks. Would recommend Disneyland Paris as a destination for a family break with young children (my daughter is 32 months old). Only downside was price of bottled water (the water fountains weren't working in the park) but you can purchase bottled water for much cheaper in the shop at the train station by the park entrance (handy to know if you have a purchase with you and don't have to carry the around in your bag all day).",1
"Disneyland is the best place you can go. After you go to Disneyland you will base every other park or day on your day there. The  cast  at DL are trained in a special way and they only let good people work there to make sure you have a great time. The park is so clean and well managed. We have had annual passes off and on for years. Disneyland is expensive. You will spend money. Parking is $16 and there are really no alternatives. The food in the park is not very good and is also $$. Get there early and stay late to get the most out of your entrance fee. Wear comfortable shoes, cool clothes and buy or bring a cute hat. Have fun and be goofy. Groups often wear shirts of the same color or with funny sayings. You can have one ride fastpass at a time, so make sure you use that system. It is also helpful to use single rider lines and though you won't sit with your group, you will wait less than half the time for the same ride. Ride the big rides early or late or during the parades.The night shows are awesome and after years of watching DL fireworks, we do not even go out on July 4. Make sure you get a good spot right in front of the castle (get there 30 mins prior) to see Tinkerbell fly and the castle lights. Bring water, but get over the cost and just get some popcorn in a souvenir bucket and a Mickey shaped ice cream. Also, I like to get the Mickey lollipop bundle for each of the kids and let them suck on one all day (its one day to do what you want). You just plain have to get over the fact that you are going to spend money, and have a great time. Use the park map to make sure that you are doing the rides without walking all over  its a big place. Let your kids circle what they want to ride and make a plan so you can do more. Often the big rides that use a fastpass have smaller ones close by so that you can ride them while you are waiting for your fastpass time. We also have had fun in line playing games like charades on our cell phone as a group and playing games like you would play in the car  like I'm thinking of an animal and I spy. We love Disneyland and though we live less than an hour away and have been there 10  times a year for over 20 years it is still the best place to go for a great day.",1
"Lots of fun, we were there at the openings, as it gets pretty crowded just before lunch",1
I love this park because we can feel the magic of the place... we had a lovely moment there in the dream of disneyland. Hope we will go back to France soon to go there again!,1
If you love disney this park is great! After playing the Xbox game I didn't even need to look at the map! I live this park.,1
Had a great time at Disneyland. Park was very clean. Staff were extremely helpful. I love everything Disney. They know how to treat their guests.,1
"Really this was indeed a very nice fun park.As a tourist you can spend 8 fun hours in this place. If you have kids, please set aside 2 or 3 days for this place. In order to enjoy this amusement park please do not run, instead take time to enjoy its each segment.It has enough offerings across Disney's famous collections, to keep you engaged for a week.You will find detailed listing on the website.A tip:1. Do not go with the crowd, instead of going along with the crowd, go in opposite direction, (instead of covering the park clockwise, try covering it anti clockwise.) It will help you avoid crowds.2. You can avail discounts on buying merchandise at every outlet in the morning hours, (i.e. basically a trick to avoid crowds at rides) but if you are planning to spend more than a day at disneyland, please keep all shpopping till after you have seen all merchandise at all shops in the park. In every shop you will additional types of merchandise which you will want to have.The shops are expensive.3. Initially the ticket prices might seem expensive, but later you will realize it was worth it.4. The safety measures are very good, actually we even found the rides to be somewhat less scary becuase of the safety measures.5. Food is good.6. Staff is very friendly.7. Do not carry eatables with you, they do not allow even canned juices inside the premises.8. DO NOT MISS ANY SECTION OF THE PARK. Each of the park segment is awesome, any words are less to describe.Once you are done with disney land, keep another day or two for Ocean Park.",1
Having been there as a child going back as an adult was surreal. Try and get there at park open as the bulk of families tend to get there after 10am. Also stay after the fireworks as again families with small kids leave then. These are the best times to get on rides with longer lines.Still magical after 30 years though.,1
I went to propose to my girl on our anniversary. Very fun time and we loved it. Would recommend this park to everyone.,1
"I grew up on Disneyland. It seems to take your cares away for a day. But nowadays,it's a struggle to walk through the park, or even plan a meal. If you spend 8 hours there, it probably means one meal and 7 rides max.I prefer to go walk around for the decorations, enjoy the sentimental feelings brought back from childhood & accept it is... what it is. Hard to get to, costly, too crowded, always.Basically, a walk down memory lane.",1
I don't think Disneyland needs a review. It is amazing and really is a place of fun for everyone. Awesome and incredible. Well done Walt Disney.,1
"Disneyland Park is located in the heart of Anaheim, surrounded by restaurants and hotels, three of which belong to them, and is accessible to 'Downtown Disney by monorail. To see and enjoy it all a 3 days or more is my recommendation, along with comfortable walking shoes, a camera to capture all the places of interest and excellent stamina to be able to stay the day. There is no place in the park that is not fun, especially if you are a young child. Places to eat and shop abound, and the activities are endless.",1
All the great Disney rides are here and it makes for a magical experience but there is a big BUT ...I cannot believe I am saying this about Disney but it is looking a lot older than 21 years! This park just isn't given the love and attention that the American parks have received and it really shows. The fact that the 20th celebration was  extended  and not rebranded to 21st celebration just about says it all. Time to get the wallet out at the Disney Corporation.The Spectacular Light Show and Fireworks are a welcome addition to round of the day so I hope they keep this as a permanent feature and the parades are always great fun to watch. However some of the staff have not been versed on the Disney Meet and Greet policy and I really miss that Florida cheer from the cast members because that is what sets Disney apart from everywhere else!Water fountains weren't working which meant we spent a fortune buying water. The food is awful and over priced so take your own packed lunch and snacks. This is France   the home of gastronomy   but if you want a decent meal leave the park and buy a sandwich from the newsagents in the train station or take the RER to Val d'Europe and eat there!Most of the restaurants in the park were closed and this was during the Easter holidays   my kids wanted to eat at Pizza Planet but sadly it wasn't open and we waited almost an hour for service one day because not all the counters were open only to find the burgers and fries were stone cold!Star Tours is in a terrible state   it needs to be closed down and upgraded   it is so sad to see our favourite ride looking so broken and unloved. We still had a great time and the kids love it but I think we should have gone to Harry Potter at Warner Brothers Studio instead!,1
We drove from Chicago to California to go to Disneyland and had a great time.  Kids enjoyed the rides and dad enjoyed them them more I think (big kid at heart).  We enjoyed the characters and food as well.,1
"Took my daughter here for her 13th birthday. Got a 2 day pass and loved every minute of it.First day we read the bus thing wrong and only had 4 hours, wasn't enough. But we knew we had a 2 day pass so no matter. 2nd day we had 10 hours, too much. But as I said a 2 day pass was plenty, one day would of been huge.We enjoyed everything about it, the rides, the staff, the characters, the facilities, the food, the shopping, oh and more shopping. Our 2 favourites where Mystic Manor ride and the buzz shooting game. They where fun without scare factor, the buzz ride scared me though as the walkway moved and my mum fell after loosing her balance. They shut the ride down immediately to assist her to her feet and ensure she was ok. That was the scariest thing all day, but the staff where exceptional with her. (Mum 71)One back on her feet she shot everything that moved and had a great time.We loved the way the park was set out and the worlds still flowed. We loved the parade at 3pm it was fun and loud and awesome. From what I have been told this is one of the smallest disneylands but it's size didn't matter the fun factor was massive. Disney is Disney big or small it makes you smile. I have no other Disney to compare too but I loved everything about this Disney. I can imagine in peak season it would be packed so now January their winter is a great time to go. It was 22 degrees not packed and a pleasant day   days.Best theme park I ha e been to so far ever. Can't wait to see the USA ones if this is the small version. Perfect day out no matter what age 13, 45 & 71 we loved it.",1
"This was my first time here and can't belive how much fun we had. I have been to LA a few times but this week we some time for fun and we went to Disneyland. My husband and I meet Mickey, how cool is that! I felt like a kid again.",1
What is there to say? Nobody does customer service and efficiency like Disney. There's plenty to see for everyone.,1
"Our family loves to come to the Magic Kingdom in Anaheim during the holidays. Main street is the place to be during the Believe in Holiday Magic firework show with the Sleeping Beauty Castle twinkling and the Christmas tree lighting. On the day we went, the Indiana Jones Adventure and Pirates of the Caribbean rides were not running due to  technical difficulties.  However, we enjoyed the Haunted Mansion with  The Nightmare before Christmas  crew and the Christmas version of It's a Small World which are  must sees  for the holiday season.",1
"The park was as good as ever but with one added bonus, that being the show and fireworks at the end of the night! It was along time to wait from when the rides stop to the actual show and kids were getting very restless but it was sooo worth the wait. We were mesmerised! Well done to all involved!",1
"The Disneyland resort park was fun. We went on a Friday and they were closing early for the Halloween event. I highly recommend the MaxPass, especially when the crowds grow in the afternoon. It was easier to use the DL app to reserve Fast Passes rather than go to the ride to retrieve one. When a ride is down and you have a Fast pass for that ride, you can return later, or use the active Fast pass on any other ride. Splash mountain and Space mountain both were down at times. Otherwise, we had a great time. ",1
"December 2014   booked another trip to LA   meeting the kids from Kailua HI, San Francisco, and Sylmar for another annual family reunion.Disneyland is a fav destination on the WEST COAST, closer to  the kids . With basically only two parks it is a lot less hectic than going to Orlando and DisneyWORLD.",1
"Just returned from a fantastic family holiday in Disneyland Paris. Travelled with our two young children (7 & 3 years old) we have all had a wonderful time. We would definitely recommend it to anyone with small children   their little faces the whole time was just priceless My top tips would be 1   book a restaurant for your first night. We didn't and couldn't get a reservation anywhere till 9.30pm (not good when everyone was hangry)2   if you want to do the wild west show it's only on Friday tuesday. Very popular so book in advance3   character breakfast was great   again book in advance4   If staying in a Disney hotel make use of the magic hours for character meets (lot of the big rides not open)5   use the fast pass system it saves lots of time.6   be prepared to queue there is not a lot you can do. We made up games stories and songs with the kids to keep them occupied!!7   bring empty bottles and a small concentrated squash  drinks in the park are expensive but free water fountains are plentiful 8   if having buffet breakfast at a hotel bring some sandwich bags and fill them up with rolls, pastries fruit etc! snacks in the park are expensive & not very healthy9   try to see some shows the kids love them   the lights and fireworks at night are absolutely amazing 10   have fun fun fun        the memories you will make (especially if you are going with children) are priceless!!",1
"Loads rides closed for refurbishment and those rides that did work kept breaking down making the thousands of people in the park all scrambling for the smaller rides, ride times when breaking down very very bad and big thunder mountain on day 1 managed to open from approx. 1030am till 11am then again from 5pm so spent most of the day broken, toilets are not very good as most toilets had black sacks or carrier bags over or in the urinals to stop people using them, surely Disney can have a better way of blocking off urinals rather than black sacks or carrier bags, food and drink very expensive e.g. ave price for burger and chips   15 , coffee so small its like a shot of coffee rather than a normal coffee, drinks very expensive e.g.ave price for small bottle of diet coke   4    5 not many character dotted around the park like their used to be, evening closing show was very good using the castle as the backdrop but feel the park is very tired and needs re looking at. staff at park not very friendly and don't give you the magic of Disney feel which is a real shame. Daily parade very good and the evening show based on the castle was amazing and worth seeing",1
We enjoyed Disneyland and highly recommend it to anyone. Check out the southern California city pass for great value entry to disneyland and other theme parks in California.,1
"What more can be said about Disneyland. Yes, it is a magical place that creates memories for a lifetime for the entire family. At the same time, yes it is an incredibly expensive day. I think all of the reviews on here say enough about the park itself so I will share my tips as a local and season pass holder: 1) Opposite of what others will tell you   do not waste your money on a Disney Hotel. You pay insane rates for a basic room. The extra hour in the park isn't worth the price. If you are a family, you can get much larger rooms (many with separate bedrooms for the kids) at the Embassy Suites, Hyatt Regency, etc.) 2) Don't plow through the day all at once. Take breaks. Spend a few hours at the park. Go back to the hotel pool nap, and then go back. 3) Do not plan a trip during any holiday or holiday weekend. You and your family will not be able to enjoy the park and you will regret it. 4) Frankly, do not go on a weekend at all! Come during the week and view the many crowd calendars before planning your trip. Coming on a weekend is miserable and a waste of time and money. 5) If you have small kids   hit Fantasyland first and do the classic rides before the lines get long. 6) Bring water and snacks in your backpack to save $",1
"We just celebrated our sons 1st bday at Disney! We stayed 6 days and had a four day park hopper pass (only way to go)It's nice having the freedom to go back and forth from parks It's also great to have a couple of days to spread things out! I would highly recommended doing 3 days or more if possible. Disneyland is an amazing place to visit! Such a great place for kids. The lines are pretty crazy! And so are the crowds (very expensive as well) but it's so worth it! Makes an amazing family vacation.My suggestion would be to go as easily as possible! Take a mid day break around 12 1 (when it becomes it's busiest) rest! Eat, go back around 5 6 (when everyone else is eating dinner) gives you time for rides before everyone gets back for fireworks and things like that. The night time shows are great! I would highly recommend fast  passing any ride you possibly can!! Parents with small children  you can get a switch pass so you're both able to ride.Bring your own snacks and water! Will save you a bunch!!!!! I also purchased a lot of our Disney stuff prior to coming! Like our Disney shirts $8 at the Disney store $25 if you buy at the park!Kids autograph books  with pen $5 6 on amazon$18 25 at Disney!! Hats $5 on amazon $16.50 25 at Disney! Also a lot of the popular rides do the fast pass for later in the day! We went to get one for space mountain at 10am and out return time to ride wasn't until 6pm! Plan around your fast passes! Best way to go and do all.",1
Great for everyone of all ages. Try to visit off season to avoid huge lines and don't forget to use the fastpass,1
This is the third Disneyland in our adventure to visit all of the m around the world. It is weird standing in line for dingo with smokers on either side of you but the park is beautiful. Pirates and Thunder Mountain are amazing and space mountain 2 has a loop!!!! You must visit the studios park to witness how truly bad it is.,1
"This place is realy cool to go to during Halloween. I had been to this attraction before and infact enjoyed it quite a lot outside of the Halloween times. However, during halloween they put on a few extra attractions of the spooky kind and they really do it well. I went at night and recommend that as the time to go (better atmosphere). One attraction in particular was a kind of ghost walk (Simple but effective). I would love to tell you exactly what happens but I don't want to spoil it for you. No matter how prepared you are to be spooked there's is always some that surprise you and it's hysterically funny. I was surprised also that the queues were not all that long. As far as I know the Halloween event goes for at least a few weeks.",1
"As a SoCal resident I highly recommend the 3 day pass! The park is always crowded with long lines, but what a magical place!! Amazing rides for every age, the parade and fireworks are beautiful. I highly recommend going during the week, and go to the most popular rides first before they get too crowded. Can't wait to go back!!",1
"Had been to Disneyland over 20 years ago and was just excited to visit this time. enjoyed the rides and the cartoon characters and love the Disney Christmas Decorations. California Adventure was new too me. Carsland was the best but unfortunately only got one ride on the Cars ride as they were having troubles with it two of the days we went in. The early morning entry thanks to our 3 day pass was excellent and the fireworks never fail to please. The roller coaster was great. Thanks again Disneyland, ",1
A great place to visit with the kids as they have lots of fun... but if ur an indian who eats vegetarian food. Please be cautious as to get something worth eating which would fill u could majorly be ice creams as the popcorns are also mostly caramel that is available... so eat a good breakfast before u get there. The not to miss is all the rides and specially the little world show of dolls. Fun unlimited for kids as they get to click pictures with all the characters of disney here and there...You will need 2days atleast to cover with kids... you start and end with the U.S street there are some places to eat Its best to download their app and be on time for all shows... know how long the lines are in which ride or show... definitely an enjoyable experience ,1
"This is a smaller version of the LA Disneyland but still just as fun.We thoroughly recommend going during the HK winter, as there are no crowds and its nice and cold. Buy the tickets on line and go mid week. We suggest taking your own picnic, as most of the cafes are closed as its off season. There were only two restaurants open, but as it was easy to get a table and the food was OK.There were no queues and we were able to get on all rides and attractions with minimal queueing. The MTR is an easy and efficient way to get there, with the train taking you right to the door.",1
"My group of 8 people visited last week and because of the season were able to make it on to all the rides within 30 mins. The only attractions that took longer were meet and greets (which by and large were totally worth the wait). Anyone looking to go to Disney and 'do it all' reall should consider going off season as the queues are unbelievably short!The only annoyance were the limited food choices. Half our group are vegetarians and we all really struggled to eat anything but burgers each day. Luckily we packed some snacks to tide us over, but getting a full and filling meal was difficult outside of Disney village.I did want to commend the staff on Pirates of the Carribean ride. As we reached the front of the line, about to board, one of our group felt faint and fell to the floor. The whole team were quick to respond and offered assistance in whatever ways they could. Eventually my friend did feel better and we were able to continue our experience, but the staff kindly allowed us some extra room on the ride itself so that our group didn't feel crowded inside the boat. This was very kind of them (as there was a growing queue behind us) and we can't thank them enough for all their help.",1
My sister and I had the most wonderful time at Disneyland the end of March 2016!  It is truly the  Happiest Place On Earth ,1
"I cannot describe my feeling when I'm there...there's magic everywhere...you feel like becoming a child again...a new born child with those lovely creatures around you...rides, games, fireworks...everything is fun...it's highly recommended...",1
Being in a resort hotel you are offered all amenities from the three hotels.,1
ActiveX VT ERROR: ,1
"I had been to Disneyland Paris many years ago on a school trip and had decided to take my children now they are 7 and 9. I grew sceptical as the date grew closer as the thought of wandering around in the heat...stories of French people barging in front of queues, over priced food, queues etc started to make me think that I had made a mistake.We stayed in Davy Crocket Ranch which was perfect. Very clean and looked brand new. It allowed our kids to go to bed (which they do quite early) whilst the adults could stay up and share the odd glass of vino!We opted for the half board package and also because staying at the hotels we could visit the parks early...we did and had a great time.We went on some of the popular rides early and had to wait about 10 mins. The place is magical and adults and children had a fantastic time. My children said  it was the best holiday ever .We loved the parade at 7pm.The French were courteous and there were smiles all round...Great holiday.",1
"Okay, so I'm a 24 year old male who loves football and I envisioned Disneyland as one of them places that I would never see myself going, I mean why would I want to go there? It's for little children & wannabe princesses right? WRONG. Ha!I went with my Girlfriend who I took as a treat, she loves all of the Disney kind of stuff! So I'm a nice guy & I decided why not, she deserves it. Leading up to going I was dreading it, 'what have I got myself in for? I'm going to be so bored.'Went to Disneyland on the Saturday, walked through the gates & it looked amazing. Then I lined up to see Minnie for 20mins, oh the joys. I thought this going to be one of them days.. Wandering along.. And hello Space Mountain, day complete. I didn't know the place was full of rides, it was good.I mean okay I didn't enjoy lining up to meet a princess for an hour lol, but I enjoyed all the silly little rides like the buzz light year one, I felt like a child again lol. I watch Captain EO, was good. Just everything was better than I expected.,I suppose you've got to be there to understand. It's just a giant busy theme park lol, not a secluded Disney Island occupied with screaming children.The parade was mint! And the Disney dreams at the end of the evening was amazing, nothing comes close to how detailed it was and magical.I spent a fortune on Crepes and Waffles, but who cares? WHEN IN ROME.The prices are going to be a little higher at these type of places, when they use about 400 fireworks each night lol. Accommodate enough money & enjoy yourself regardless of your age.America next! :)CONS: toilets were vile, some of the rides were closed & a lot of fast food rather than nice meals.",1
"The kids loved the rides. More kiddy rides suitable for kids up to 9 years old. The amenities, toilets and restaurants are well kept and clean. Loved the 10th year anniversary performance, parades and fireworks esp the Lion King performance and the Mystic Manor ride. Thumbs up.",1
"This is an amazing amusement park! So many nice rides, for people in different ages! You should book tickets for two days if you can because the park is huge and you want to see almost everything! Because the park is big you need good shoes for walking.. Eating inside the park is of course very expensive, so I suggest you to eat outside park, there you can find McDonald's, Starbucks and places like that.",1
"My sister surprised me with an annual pass 3vyears ago. I get to visit from Las Vegas frequently and we take her 3 youngest kids with us (15yr old niece and 2 11 yrs old twins nephews). We cannot get enough of Disneyland and Disney California. We're kind of obsessed with it. We all love Star Wars too so all the new SW additions are amazing. Tips for newbies:1) don't park hop in one day. It takes too long getting through the lines and crowds if you don't time it just right. We spend our time one park at a time.2) get fast passes immediately. I usually take a twin with me while my sis, niece and the other twin waits in line at another attraction. Maximize time people! As soon as you're eligible to get another FP get one! This helps cut down time waiting in line.3) do the rides in that land instead of running back and forth between Tomorrowland and critter country where the 2 lands are at opposite ends of the park.4) use the train like a subway to get from one major area to another. My husband says it's his favorite  ride  but I don't agree. It's a great way to get from one area to another.5) eat breakfast before you get there. Bring snacks and water bottles with you. Save food and beverage purchases for the special places. My favorite is the Mexican place by Thunder Mountain Railroad. The clam chowder by Pirates of the Caribbean is awesome and you must try the burgers in Tomorrowland. 6) if you're a ride lover like my sister and I, skip the shows and parades and do rides in the adjacent areas as lines are shorter. You might be able to do Haunted Mansion and Pirates a few times when Fantasmic is playing. Sooooo much fun!!7) if you're new to the park, study the map and layout ahead of time. Go to bathrooms on way to other rides.8) take lots of photos as souvenirs. Shop at close by Walmart and Target for small souvenirs near the park if you're on a budget.9) don't waste time waiting in line with characters unless you're in a big group and someone is shopping or on a potty break. You can snap their pictures while in line.10) get there early and stay late. The rides are busiest 12p 8p so morning and later at night are not as bad for lines.Enjoy!!",1
"We took our 3 children as a surprise holiday and all 5 of us loved it. None of us had ever been before to any Disneyland World and we were not disappointed. From the way you collect your tickets electronically outside the gate to the quality of the rides to the amazing service to the night parade and fireworks, it was all top notch and I would recommend it 100%.Our children are 8, 5 & 5 and there was plenty for them all to enjoy. Older children may get bored though.Midweek, the cues were short and we saw the whole park in 2 days easily, and went on lots of rides several times. Space Mountain was a great roller coaster for the whole family and an amazing experience. Toy Story world was a highlight, as was the way the Disney princesses and characters pose for pictures with you and don't move you on quickly it felt calm and personal.Food souvenirs inside the park are not cheap but certainly not the rip off we were expecting.It was spotlessly clean and the staff were superb.We would love to go again.",1
It will indeed give you an experience of a lifetime.Rides and attractions are made for any one. It will let you recall your childhood memories.    PlacesForAllAges,1
"such a nice and great place for family vacation, with so much section to visit, there will be not enough time to explore the whole theme park. The parade quite often, and the crowd still reasonable, so you will not miss a nice attraction of many disney icon, you can enjoy the park, but not for some attraction which a long queue and many uneducated people which can not queue and always try to push you or cut your queue line, if you stay for a quite long time in Hong Kong, you will understand that many people doesn't understand the meaning of  queue .",1
"I thought this would be my one and only time out there as I usually go to Orlando BUT I was so impressed that I definitely will go back. Obviously is is in no way the grand scale of Disney World but it was a refreshing change of pace. I love the proximity of everything and the ease of getting around in short time. Some of the rides were definitely better here (ie It's a Small World, Haunted Mansion Holiday) and some stuff (ie crowd control, parades) could not compare to Orlando. I really enjoyed it more than I thought and liked some stuff so much that I am bummed it isn't available in Orlando. The weekend time was a nightmare for crowds but come the weekdays it became a relaxing experience. Space Mountain was 120  wait all weekend but diring the week it was under 30 mins. I love all things Disney and can't wait to visit again!",1
"Disneyland is always Magical. I have been an annual passholder for a couple years now. Best piece of advice for first timers, buy a guide! one that gives you the step by step what to do where to go. Good ones will have multiple plans such as do all Disney in a day or 2 days, giving you the option of various paces. Once you do Disneyland with the guide you will get a feel for the flow of the park and can adjust accordingly. Also take the time to review scheduled closures and double check that the night before. If you can afford it stay at a DIsneyland hotel (the Disneyland Hotel is a personal fav) Besides feeling like you are a part of the magic 24 7 anything you buy in the park can be delivered to your hotel and picked up at Bell Services. Also it allows for a 2 hour relax at pool mid day to recharge.",1
"Although it was crowded, it was still well managed. Everything was clean and they were so accommodating. We had a great time and are trying to figure out a way to go back!",1
"I don't think there is anything I could add that has not been said before, fun fun fun and the expression on my 7 year old was brilliant the magic starts the minute you step of the train and keeps going long after you leave. The Fast Pass worked brilliantly and restaurants were priced as you would expect at any theme park lunch roughly 10 euro per head and dinner 25 euro per head",1
We love Disneyland and would go more if it were closer.  It is definitely on our  1 places to go...,1
"How do you not enjoy Disneyland....well we of course enjoyed it. Rides, entertainement, fireworks all outstanding. However ..... the new photo ID (constant checking) changed 5 10 minute lines to get in the park to 40 60 minute lines (really what's the issue?). We had purchased on line tickets which you need to get turned into park tickets (so started with the outside booth), short line 15 20 people, 6 booths open figured 5 minutes....we were there over an HOUR, this is not DISNEY like. Once in the park each day.....great, it is after all Disneyland.....but whew terrible way to start each day.",1
It   s expanded a lot since I visited 5 years ago but mainly a lot of experiences and eating spots. The weather was hot and the food was so so but the kids still had a good time going on all the rides from tweens To young kids. There is a lot of walking from one end to the other made a little more inconvenient because it   s so far and fantasyland castle is closed. Would warn people not to buy any food outside the park even though it looks like a Disneyland sanctioned store with people wearing Disneyland clothes. Because you won   t be allowed into the park. ,1
Travelled with my 10 year old daughter to disney   she loved it.  Great closing ceremony on the Saturday night.  Rides for all ages and if you do not like the rides plenty of shopping   characters to meet.,1
"Such a divine day out, best to get there at opening time to avoid the afternoon madness. Hire a stroller for the kids and you are off. We love going to Mystic Manner and Toy Land the most and then on to Its a Small World and the main rides in the middle. Best to go when not so hot as no shade from the sun unless inside shops or restaurant. The parade is fabulous too. Kids love it every time and so do I!",1
Happiest place on earth!  Took the small kiddos on their first family vacation and they loved it.  Can't wait to go again after the new Star Wars land opens!,1
"My daughter just had to visit Disneyland Paris while we were on vacation in France. There's not much difference between this park and the ones in Anaheim or Orlando, but it was still a magical day in the happiest place on earth   made even more so because we were in Paris!!",1
The park was immaculate when we visited and we throughly enjoyed our time in this park. The planting and attention to details was really very good and that's difficult to achieve with plants and trees at this time of year. The park offered something for all our party aged from 2 to 60 and the parades and fireworks every night were spectacular. The thing that really disappoints is the quality and PRICE of the food available in the park. I don't mind paying high prices for good food BUT I do object to paying ridiculous prices for awful cheap processed rubbish food. If it weren't for this I would give the park 5 stars.,1
"I went there with friends and I'm glad I did! It was so fun. It brought me back childhood memories from my favorite movies and characters. It's much smaller than the Disney parks in the USA, but you can definitely have a full day of fun activities. There are plenty of exciting rides for both kids and adults. They have the old manor, the dolls house (it's a small world), the cups from Alice in Wonderland, the castle, etc. Plus, you get the chance to take pictures and get stickers from many movie characters. The parade started around 9PM and it didn't disappoint. One thing different from the parks in the USA is that there's no alcohol.Great place for a weekend with family and or friends!",1
"Loads to do and see here, I can understand why people do more than 1 day.We loved the Buzz Lightyear ride and my boy and I liked driving the car in automotor thing nearby. My wife and son didn't want to go on space mountain, so while they queued for the rockets I went down the single rider queue, twice! My son is 7 and he really enjoyed all of the smaller attractions as well, he's a Star Wars nut so built his own Lightsaber (slightly jealous!). The parade is good for the kids, you need to be in position by about 5pm, though if your're not fussed I can imagine the queues for the other rides and significantly shorter at this time.I really enjoyed the band that play in square just after the entrance, and we queued up to meet Winnie the Pooh. Be aware that the official photo's take a couple of hours to be ready, though there are plenty of places to pick them up.You can spend an absolute fortune in here so be aware, oh, and the coffee from the little stands is disgusting!Overall we had great fun, loads to do.",1
They have expanded the park over the years and it wasn't crazy busy even though it was a Sunday. The new iron man experience is pretty cool and buzz light year is always fun. Enough to do for a full day now that the park has expanded over the years. ,1
"Have to give it a five, though would give a four and a half if I could. The park has just become too crowded   too many people on motorized scooters running you over and then yelling at you for being in their way. However, with that said, still a wonderful place to visit and always nostalgic.",1
"Just back from 4 days at Disney Paris and we re all still buzzing. Dont let the miserable reviewers put you off, some people eh? Yes its busy, yes its terribly expensive , (a bottle of water is   2.50.), yes its exhausting but its also brilliant fun, beautiful to look at and very clean and professionally run. We went on every open ride and to every show except the Dumbo ride for kids which had the longest queue. Most of the other rides had waiting times of 15 minutes, fast pass helped sometimes to shorten that to 10 minutes. Most rides were probably ideal for 9 years old and up, ie a little scary but not too much. Only Space Mountain, Rock n Roll Coaster and perhaps Tower of Terror were a little challenging.Older teens might find them lame...We loved the shows, Animagique, Stitch was hilarious, Moteurs was exciting,Disney Juniors for kids. The food was massively overpriced and average. Macdonalds in Disney Village is better value as there were meal deals but I hate Mcdonalds so not for us! The parades were fun and Disney Dreams at 8pm was a stunning end to our day. This place is huge and we walked at least 5 miles every day. I dont think a 1 day visit would give you enough time to see everything even in 1 park . We did 2.5 days in Disneyland Park and 1.5 days in Walt Disney Studios. We never saw any litter but the continentals do like to smoke their Gitanes or Camels right in your face....The shops are great to wander around but yes expensive . We had a brilliant family holiday , our ten year old enjoyed everything about the park and even I , king of complainers , smiled all day....especially when I met Goofy. Meet and greets were available with all the animals in Main Street every day, there were queues for about 20 mins, we got lucky and chanced upon Goofy, Minnie, Pluto, Stitch and Chip n Dale in a quiet corner with no one around. Dont let the complainers put you off, Disney is an awesome, expensive, once in a lifetime experience that every family should do once...My final piece of advice is make a map plan before you go or you ll miss things out...",1
How can I say anything bad about Disneyland? The lines were long and the crowds huge but it really didn't matter!,1
It's super fun! I am never too bored to visit every year.,1
"Fantastic parades but the light show firework display at 10pm was just breathtaking. Fantastic place to visit for wheelchair users & disabled people   staff couldn't be more helpful, can't speak highly enough of them.",1
Visited Dinseyland when kids were young    memorable expreiences.  Now pushing for a visit with the grandchildren.,1
"Loved it all. Favorite ride was Nemo submarine.  Staff was so helpful and kind! Rented a stroller, very convenient.",1
"We had another great time at Disney. The only complaint it that my mother has a disability, and she was unable to use a disability pass on all the rides at California Adventure.",1
"Great park just has that extra magic that other theme parks seem to be missing. Great parades, Dreams fantastic as always, park always appears clean with friendly staff. Make use of Extra Magic Hours and Fast Pass to maximise your time. Space Mountain a personal favourite of mine and nothing beats that first view of the castle!",1
"loved it   tick this off my bucket list   only disappointment was we were there a few days before the 60th anniversary celebrations so some things werent on eg: parade, fireworks   so a little disappointed we missed these",1
"Great rides and atmosphere, way too crowded, fast passes really helped, New Star Tours is Great, Workd of Color show is so so.",1
"It was a 2day fun at hk disneyland. And our 2nd time to visit. I recommend two day pass so you really go through all attractions. The weather was just perfect when we went there ( dec1 ) to walk around the park not too hot and not too cold. There were new attractions when we there the toy story, magic mansion and all . Long que on all rides. Food is expensive but ok. We were able to see and enjoy everything the place has to offer. It was really the happiest place on earth.",1
"Definitely worth a visit, even if it's not a patch on Florida... The parade is great, and there is always something going on... We didn't have any kids with us, but was a great day out nonetheless.",1
"I initially had thought that Disney was for kids, and the prime reason I was going was for my little prince and princess. What we do for our kids right?! However, I loved Disneyland from beginning to end. There are shows galore here for the young and old. The rides are great and not just limited to the little kiddy rides. There was even one that i couldn't go on myself and my husband took my little boy for a spin on Space Mountain! The fireworks spectacular is late. Yes, I know its at 9 pm and I realise that this is way past some kids' bedtimes, and my own too when we're at home. However it is well worth the wait. Lights, sound, fireworks   what more could you ask for?Also the Plaza Inn Cafe is open until late for dinner service and the food is traditional Cantonese and is extremely good. Reasonably priced and lovely, unpretentious service.",1
"Never been to a Disney before. Very impressive place. Certainly a full day's entertainment. Kids liked it ... as an adult I enjoyed it for their sake. Air conditioned shops pepper the landscape and draw in hot and sweaty punters. Then the relentless souvenir spending kicks in ! Just go with it. For some reason, I can't get  Holiday Road  out of my head. ",1
I just love Disneyland like most everyone else; very disappointed that the Indiana Jones ride was down!,1
"Took our three kids and our eight grandkids here in April. It was a little crowded, but to be expected. Food is way over priced so take your own in. The lines are long for the rides and you can only get one fast pass at a time so choose carefully which ride you want. ",1
"Fun!  Busy, can have long lines, and fast passes for many rides.  Go with a positive attitude!  Life is what you make it.  Fireworks may be cancelled due to wind.",1
We spent 6 hours there and could have had longer. The rides are really good. i took about 200 photoes. We enjoyed the rides that we went on. The shops cater well for all people. We would recomend anyone to get the extra days ticket.,1
"We visited them in early Jan, and on a weekday. Hence, there was practically no queues at the roller coaster rides. Even though the park was small, and there wasn't long queues, we still didn't manage to take all the rides. Perhaps we were walking too slowly. Since most visitors brought their small children, the kiddie rides such as the jungle cruise, flying dumbo, slinky the dog, and autopia had the longest queues (~15 minutes). ",1
"go with an open mind and by the end of two days you'll be cuddling men in fluffy animal suits and grinning madly.... all good disney fun, fab parades, extravagantly expensive and if you haven't got rid of the its a small world tune from your head until a month after leaving you won't be alone....",1
The magic nearer to home. Much more expensive than Florida but great for a long weekend. Disney Hotel is the best to stay in to get the whole experience. Themed times of year vary so pick yours carefully . We thoroughly enjoyed a long weekend and have done this several times over the years,1
"Pro tip   you can ride with the monorail driver if you beeline for the first car. Pro tip   on train engines 1 & 2 you can ask to ride the tender car, if you are lucky you get on! Disneyland is always fun, for anyone. Come here and have some fun.",1
"We stayed in Holiday Inn Buena Park which is about 10 15 min ride away from DisneyLand if the traffic is clear.The first time we did was to take the train that goes around Disneyland to have an overview of it and we ended up with our first ride at the submarine. It was a nice slow ride in the submarine where it goes around in an artificial pool.Unlike Universal Studios, Disneyland does not have a system of queueing for taking pictures with some of the mascots except for Mickey and Minnie, and winne the pooh with his friends. People were crowding around and makes photo taking difficult. The queue to to a photo with Mickey in his house was very long about an hour. However it is worth it as you will walk through his house which is so nice and sweet. The queue for Minnie is shorter.Most of the time we went around taking pictures and shopping for merchandise. This place will be perfect for families with children. I'm sure they will love it. Most of the rides are suited to children but many of the queues were much longer.There is a boutique there that will provide make over for your daughter and change her into a princess and she can be in that outfit throughout Disneyland. I thought it was cute and sweet. But I guess it wouldnt be cheap.It is similar to Japan's DisneyLand. However, you will not find nice cute tins of Biscuit in Anaheim like those from Japan and HK. I guess they don't really focus on merchandise. I do find the service excellent. I suppose the serive attitude in LA is always very good. We felt welcomed and enjoyed the trip.We ended our quest for rides at the canoe and decided to find a good spot for the parade. The parade will commence from the entrance of the Disneyland and move up to the central area (castle). You will see Mascots and decorated vehicles. So find yourself along the roadside and you can be comfortably seated on the road to watch the parade. I think it starts aroun 6 p.m. or 6.30 p.m. We had some time left to get some food for dinner and find ourselves a spot for the fireworks. We were seated along the roadside just in front of the castle. We got ourselves a gianatic turkey leg that cost $10 USD and we dont like the taste at all. The hot chocolate and chocolate chip bread was nice. It kept us warm in the evening. The temperature was below 16 degrees celcius.The fireworks was worth waiting. It lasted about 20 mins with tinkerbell and dumbo in the air.",1
"The park was wonderful, our only wish was there some bigger coaster for teens, as sadly hyperspace mountain was closed for refurbishment. The parades and fireworks were amazing, we were lucky to get vip viewing areas to watch these due to the package we booked with hotel this made it even more magical and stress free. We visited the park for 2 days day one doing all rides and jedi temple. (This was a Wednesday and tge queues were 15mins max. On Thursday we concentrated more on shows, parades, fireworks and a few favourite rides it was much busier with wait time of 30   40mins.Fireworks were AMAZING.We visited for my son's birthday and he received a birthday badge to where, staff and characters very friendly wishing him happy birthday.",1
The line management gets better all the time   we visited in June and never waited more than 30 minutes forvanything,1
"What can I say about this?! Dreams really do come true!Took my ten year old daughter and my partner 7 10th of December (got back last night) we had constant thrills, surprises and entertainment. Here is some pointers for those wishing to go:Good tips high points of trip;Disney dreams show  free and only on for 20th anniversary ... Jaw dropping !! A fantastic display of water, lazers, projected film and fireworks. No display will ever compare bonfire night will be ruined for ever!!! Haha. Alot of time and effort but in to this it was unbelievable !! Grown men (including my one) were awe struck, mouthing WOW... So you can imagion what the kids were like. Stunning.Disney parade  see all the fave characters dance, sing and wave to you as they go by, colourful and fun. Will have you dancing in the street!Meet n greets  at various times you get to see Micky, Minnie or whoever you like! Have a hug and kiss and photograph. This is overwhelming for the children I was crying at the smaller kids reactions so cute!!! And they prioritise the sick kids who visit the park (as they should) and make a real fuss of them. Heartwarming stuff... Take Kleenex !Wild bill show Now you do pay extra for this... But! Wow! Horses, cowboys, Indians and real buffalo!!! All in a western extravaganza !! With 3 course meal  not gourmet by any standard but tasty filling grub in the style fitting for the show, only one drink per ticket... But I got my beer refilled 3 times, bonus!!!Oh and we all got a snazzy cowboy hat haha! Yeeee haaaa!Ice skating at Rockefeller  Extra for this also! You will be poor after this trip! But again, worth it! With that scenery and magic skating hand in hand with your family is something you will remember forever. Your thighs will get the work out of their lives !! All that walking then skating!! But magical!Rides:Don't miss, space mountain, thunder train, Indiana jones and in the studio park, crushes coaster, rock n roller, and Hollywood tower of terror!! Our child is 10 so we went mental on the big rides! However we loved lots of the tame ones as well... Too many to list! But don't miss pirates of the Caribbean and buzz light year your child will be amazed !!But please FAST PASS!!! A free way to book your slot on the rides! We ate lunch or watched a show whilst waiting for our turn! The ques could ruin your trip other wise. You have been warned. Oh and don't miss out on the early rides that open 2 hours early  no ques!!! The sights:The effort gone in to the scenery... Wow. Nothing will ever be good again! Just take an hour to look at the place. You can't belive it. It's so detailed and pretty and everything!!!! It's christmas on steroids !!! Oh also go for christmas as the decorations alone are worth a look. My christmas tree looks like a mere twig in comparison ... So beautiful.Bad points :Not much really ... But the ques are awful for the big rides and Unforntuatly some of the good ones do not have a fast pass (why Disney ???) wear 34 jumpers as you will be frozen to death by the time you get to the front! But as I said fast pass where you can!Also the food is junk on the park and extortionate!!! Take more money than you think you need. You'll spend it. Trust me. We made a pack lunch with out breakfast stuff which is a top tip!!! But with even that... Don't expect to spend less than   100 a day on food and drinks alone. Same with the shops! A teddy will set you back   35!!! I no it's a big commercial engine... But unless your loaded I'd avoid taking your child into the shops too much, as you don't want to disappoint them by saying 'no I won't buy you a key ring for   10000...' Ok I'm exaggerating ... But you get the point!Another top tip!! Don't spend extra on a 'posh' hotel if you only going for a few days... We literally just slept there! We stayed at the Santa Fe hotel and its basic but more than adequate ! Save money where you can!!! You'll spend it else where on somthing better. Overall... Do it !!! Just go! Save if you have to, but every child should have this experience. Money isn't everything and just forget about 'value' for a few days... You switch on to Disney mode and spend like crazy but is it worth it? Yes yes yes!! Best trip ever!!!!!!",1
"As first timers in the park, we had some local friends tell us the best way to navigate through the park. We didn't wait any longer than 35 minutes for any ride, got fast passes to Hyperspace Mountain in the afternoon and even got to walk on in some areas. The parades were fun to watch and the firework show was incredible.  Cast Members  were constantly cleaning the park, so it was always clean. Food is crazy expensive and you obviously know that going in. We made dinner reservations at Carnations Caf   for 5 and we didn't wait long when we came back to eat. My only negative comment is that there are strollers everywhere, and some folks can be a little ruthless moving through crowds. Overall, it was a great experience and I hope to come back one day. ",1
"We visited Disneyland in late March and early April and had a fantastic time with our family. There is plenty to do over the course of several days and a variety of rides for all ages and interests. The Electric Light Parade was a fun blast from the past. Catch the park later in the evening if you can to take advantage of shorter wait times. Otherwise, head into the park right when it opens if you have small children and get most of the major rides done before the busy afternoon hours.",1
I've enjoyed growing up with Disneyland as part of my families places to visit.  My husband never went as a child and we felt like kids again.  The ride and attractions were awesome.  Wish I could stay there all the time.,1
"We really enjoyed our trip to the Park as part of our daughters 30th birthday celebrations. The visit was made more enjoyable with out 20 month old grand daughter also being with us. She was enthralled with the smaller rides and seeing some of the characters. My only criticism is you can see the financial woes of the business have prevented them from keeping the Park in top order or adding more up to date attractions. Would recommend only if young kids were in the party, and watch out for lengthy queues for rides and food.The night time show is well worth waiting to see.",1
Best day ever! Don't forget to get a map and plan your day. Pack ponchos. Water bottles. Bring healthy snacks.,1
"The greatest vacation spot in the world. I only wish there was less crowds. If you want to make the best out of your trip, do not go during major holidays or school vacations.",1
"Anyone that does not feel like a kid again once they step onto the Disney train should not be there.   what can i say, it is Disney. very clean, very fun and very crowded",1
"I'll start by saying if you are a Disney fan, this is a must do! The park is very different than Disney World, however very similar. It's like a smaller version with some  original  nuances to make it unique and charming. The non snack food dining is better than WDW though. Enjoy the happiest place on earth!",1
"We had a great day at the park. We were not sure if one day would be enough but it was perfect for us. Our son is not keen on rides so only wanted to go on the car one. This had a 30 minute wait but it went really quickly. Each ride states the wait time before you line up, which is great for deciding whether to wait around or not. The park train was not in operation when we arrived which we only found out after already lining up for 20 minutes. This was packed as many people went straight there upon arrival. We went back just prior to leaving to see if it was working and it was just about to take its first trip. Even though we were the only ones lined up (3 of us), we were told we would have to wait for the next trip even though we could clearly see loads of empty seats and about 4 empty carriages. We waited but then our son needed to go to the bathroom (possibly do this before heading to line up!) so we needed to leave anyway. The lines were long again once we returned so we just headed home. Shame to have missed it but it clearly wasn't meant to be! The Frozen parade was simple Anna and Elsa on a horse and cart whilst songs from the movie played. It was beautiful to hear the songs in French though! So even though we didn't go on the rides, we still thoroughly enjoyed our day and the atmosphere on the whole. We spent a good 6 hours there and i'm not sure if we even covered the whole park. If you intend to line up for rides then you will need plenty more time as a lot of your time will be spent lining up. Most of the rides we saw had wait times of between 30 and 60 minutes.",1
"We have had annual passes for 15 years and absolutely LOVE this park. There is just nothing like Disneyland. However, the annual prices have increased greatly over the years and we have had to down grade our pass bc of this. It doesn't stop me from loving this park. Amazing rides, attractions and shows. Everyone regardless of their age can come and have fun!!",1
"My bridesmaids orgranised a stay at Disneyland Paris from 15 19th May 2017 for my hen do   and it was fantastic!The train journey from Ashford was easy and the transfer time from the disney train station to our hotel was quick and straight forward. We stayed at hotel Cheyenne which was a great base for exploring the park. The parks themselves are amazing (but then again I am a big kid at heart!). We spent the first day exploring Walt Disney Studios which was great   lots to see and do for both adults and children. A real highlight for me was watching the Star Wars show (which operates a couple of times a day) in the main outdoor stage. We were lucky enough to be able to get on a couple of rides more than once as the ques dipped around lunchtime   and the best ride for me has to be either the Hollywood Hotel Tower of Terror or Crush's Rollercoaster (I thought this was a kids ride, bu boy was I pleasently surprised!)We didn't get to explore the whole of Walt Studios that first day but were able to go back a few more times over our 5 day stay.The main park is absolutely huge! I think we clocked up over 25,000 steps a day! Exhausting but so much fun! I love exploring Fronteirland and actually don't have a favourite part of this park   it was iconically surreal even being there a lot of the time! There were lots of shows happening around different parts of the park (e.g. on the princess stage) and lots of opportunities to meet the characters   however the ques for these are often long and frustrating (especially in the princess house in fantasy land). We clocked on about 3 days into our visit that we could use our early ours to get in and meet the characters, leaving the rest of the day for the rides.The ques for the rides were sometimes long (about 50 mins) but were fast moving and a lot of the time, in the shade so it wasn't an unpleasant experience queing.We loved the star wars additions to the park and especialyl how they have tailored space mountain to  hyperspace mountain    this has got to be up there with one of my favourites!Regarding food, we had breakfast included but there are plenty of retaurants (both sit down ones ad fast food) around if you get hungry, although these can be expensive. We took some non perishable food that we kept in our rooms for lunches so we just had to worry about buying dinners. We were lucky enough to visit in their 25th anniversary year which meant that the evening firework shows and the final parade were spectacular   although you do have to get there early for both of these to get any sort of good view!Myself and one other of the girls decided to do the Wild West Show (which includes dinner) and although we were hesitant at first as it seemed like more of a family child experience   we are so glad we did it! The show and the food was well worth watching and was actually really god value for money we think!Loved every minute of the stay and am already planning to come back again!",1
"Had a great time. There's a Christmas Tree lighting show which is worth the wait (6ish at night). Though it is smaller than other Disney's, it's still worth the trip. Actually, we've been here twice (a total of 4 days) and we still haven't tried all the rides. The Golden Mickey show is great...even though it was in chinese (there's a TV that shows the english translation. Loved Lion King. The new section, Toy Story, was nice but rides (except for the slinky dog ride) are more for teenagers and adults (one adult woman had the funniest face of horror while riding the parachute ride). Had a great time. Can't wait for the next visit.",1
"I am a former WDW cast member, worked there during a summer in college and remained a huge Disney fan since then. I have only been to Walt Disney World from Orlando, Florida which is the biggest and of course the whole resort from Paris is way smaller. You won't see those cast members smiling without reason, but it's still Disney. For me it would have been a tragedy to go to Paris without a day at Disneyland.I bought one day for two parks ticket and I was there at opening time at 10 am, me together with MILLIONS of tourists although on a Monday in June and only stayed until 7 pm because we were too tired. Recommendation: go during the week.So when you plan your visit consider the fact that in the morning, between opening time and 12 am the crowds are a bit smaller, but you may not be able to stay until closing; but on the other hand you could come later and stay to see the parades and fireworks.Expect to see overpriced souvenirs and food, but that doesn't mean we didn't buy them as they were all so cute. :)Since we bought the ticket for the two parks which are 2 minutes walking distance, we went from 2 pm to 5 pm to Walt Disney Studios in a couple of attractions and then came back to the main park. But if I were to go again, I would like to spend two days at Disney: one full day at Disneyland and the second day 1 2 of it at Walt Disney Studios and then again at the castle, my favorite spot.If you have only one day for Disney and in case you have some hot attractions in Walt Disney Studios like our case that you don't want to miss, then it's better to buy the two parks ticket as the difference is not that big; but don't be afraid as even if you have one full day from opening to closing only in Disneyland, I am sure you don't have the time to ride and experience everything so you won't get bored.Also you should take advantage of the fast pass system, only one fast pass per park can be hold in the same time, so if you plan to rush to Walt Disney Studios, you can take a fast pass in Disneyland which you could use when you come back. But usually the fast passes for the big attractions are released in the first hours, so even if you like to get one in the afternoon, the odds are that the maximum fast passes were already issued, so be careful how you plan the fast passes.Enjoy Disney, the place to build memories!",1
"It is a very warm day today. My two kids are totally cooked. But, they do enjoy the trip and have a lot of fun. But, I wont do this again. The waiting line is too long.",1
"We took 3 under fives to Disneyland Paris and had a wonderful time. I would definitely recommend hiring a stroller as little ones will moan about the walking. We were lucky enough to get VIP fast passes which were a must although many rides were not fast pass. The only real queue was for the 'meet a princess' which involved a 2 hour wait. You will queue for other rides but this is part of the experience. I've been to Florida park and believe that Paris is better for smaller ones. The end of day show was fantastic but many people tried to push in after you had been waiting for an hour! The restaurants were standard but expensive. Overall, we had a great time and just seeing the look on my little ones faces when meeting Cinderella and Mickey Mouse was simply priceless.",1
"  THE FROZEN SHOW  The best thing I've enjoyed most was definitely the Frozen show. It's 100% loyal to the animation with all songs it included. And it provided us with great actors who sang well and made a good atmosphere. Props, Background, all sorts of effect, they made it a fantastic musical! This show was really the highlight of that day!  BUY TWO  DAY PASS IF YOU WANNA PLAY MORE ATTRACTIONS  There's a long distance between US and Hong Kong. So we seldom visit Disneyland in California. That's why we chose to buy two day pass to make us less worry, and avoided the situation of running to the next attraction ( to queue). The one we bought is allowing us to travel two parks anytime we wanted in a day. This is handy if you wanna visit more attractions in both parks in that day",1
"First hand viewing of the Disneyland Fireworks outside the parks I suggest plopping your gutts right on the Esplanade which is the center 'compass' en lade on the ground in between California Adventure & Disneyland! It is fun and we even heard the music; though it was fighting with the Downtown Disney piped in music! Sitting on that large ground campass is perfect! for a Saturday summer night this June, it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be.Another place to see the fireworks, especially if you have a tailgate, is right over at Mimi's restaurant, just look above the restaurant behind it! THAT was a cool time watching it from there, we could hear some of the music too! Also, you can go down the street from Mimi's and grab a Starbucks and watch from there as well, walking back towards Mimi's on top the I 5 overpass is the best though!As for the Mickey & Friends parking lot, not interested in hearing car alarms & horns so though a good view not theeeee best outside the parks, besides, you either have to pay $15 to drive up in it, or park over at DTD for the free 3 hours and then walk to the garage.You can go up to floor 5 balcony of Desert Inn and have a very nice view, also see tinker bell from up there too!These are the places that I have experienced other than just being inside the park in front of the castle...that is theeeeeee best! But not everyone can go into Disneyland when they are in Anaheim near the parks. Many of the hotels and just being on the streets and driving on the I5 allows you to see the fireworks anyways. But Esplanade, Mimi's were pretty darn good and not too busy!",1
"Disneyland is such an iconic location. It is the reason for the holiday. You don't tell your 6 and 8 year old ids we are going to LA, you say we are going to Disneyland.We got a 4 Day Park Hopper pass. I was originally going to get 3 Day, But it was not much more to get the additional day at the time of booking, and I am glad I did. The one thing about small children is they find it hard to do a full day.Our kids were just the right age. They loved everything about Disneyland. They loved the characters, and got their photos taken with many.We travelled to LA just after Easter (arriving Easter Monday) and the park was still very busy, although many of the workers said it was quiet. We found it quieter the next week.Tips(1) get a 4 Day pass instead of the 3 Day. You can upgrade once there, but it costs more;(2) some food outlets are better than others. Some were really delicious. We found the worst to be the Red Rose Taverne (Part of the Beauty and the Beast section);(3) Fast passes go quickly for the more popular rides. Radiator Springs (in Cars) ran out by lunch time;(4) While the Fact passes are probably linked to an entry card, no one checked. So if there are four of you visiting, you can get four passes. And one person (here the 8 year old) can use them all;(5) Some rides have a line for a single rider, which was good as really only our 8 year old wanted to do many of the rides;(6) Photo pass is great, but we realised too late. If you get a card from the first person to take your photographs, you can link that to the App and they have all photos taken in the park linked. Also many rides take photos. At the exit note the photo code and likewise link it on the App. Then for one fee, you can download all of the photos taken in the Park; ",1
"Great trip   Well worth staying to the light display which is 8pm on week nights and 10pm on Saturday & Sunday. Pirates of the Caribbean was fantastic (avoid the Blue Lagoon Restaurant which is visible from this ride), Peter Pan is great as well... Lost a star as the staff are generally moody looking & little unapproachable. Not the disney way!",1
We had a fantastic 4 days in the parks. The crowds are large but if you follow the advice of the experts and go early you really don't wait for many rides. We stayed at a Disney property and it was well worth it for getting the early entry. I also downloaded ridemax and it was really helpful in understanding how to plan your rides. So get organized and know what rides you want to do and it will be a blast. My boys 5 and 7 rode everything and loved it.,1
"So much to see, so much to do, great food and fantastic staff. Had 2 excellent days at the parks, not once did we see an unhappy face, every member of staff was pleasant, friendly and person centered. Booked up to return in Sept 15.",1
"Convenience, Staffs are friendly ,, there are not many rude mainland ppl,, didnt need to line up for long time for rides,   There are several restaurants provide nice food.",1
"We went with another couple on Christmas Day. It was busier than I expected but was just incredible. Only went for one day (9am 10.30pm), which suited us as we had no kids with us. A very long day though. The big thrill rides certainly didn't disappoint. 2 were out of action a couple of times during the day which happened to be the times we had our fast pass for, but we were able to use it later so was great.The fast passes are certainly the way to go though!Oh and the light firework display at the end of the night is just breathtaking and worth waiting around for!",1
We had a blast. Buying the fast pass deal is the way to go. Use the app to sign in. We barely waited to get on rides all day. We   ve been to the Florida one so many times and had to check this one out. Only downfall is I don   t understand how people from out of town make a vacation out of it due to the prices. A one day park hopper pass with fast pass added for 3 people was around $600. That   s insane. Probably be a long time before we come back but for a one time deal it was magical. ,1
We loved Disneyland.  The fireworks were cancelled one night we were there due to bad weather which was ashame.  The wait time (2 hours) for spoash moutain was a bit of a joke but overall we had a magical time.,1
"This is the park that Walt himself dreamed of and built up piece by piece. You can really feel the magic everywhere you go in this park. Unfortunately, you can also feel strollers hitting your ankles and calves if you are not careful. I suggest that Disney consider limiting the size of the strollers allowed in the park for the benefit of all the guests. Also that guest wear closed toed shoes with at least ankle socks. All 4 days one member of my party got either a cut or a bruise from a parent pushing their oversized stroller.",1
"I had a great time here to visit such an iconic place. Indeed, I felt a certain magic in the air. All the memories from the cartoons and also from visiting Eurodisney when I was younger. I realised i might have gone in the Pinocchio ride then and the memories sort of came back. Best ride was the new Star Tours. I managed to watch all the scenarios after going for 6 rides. The gift stores are really dangerous, Vinylmation is really addictive and tricky, you want to buy everything! And the staff are super friendly. The fireworks show was lovely. Will definitely visit again if I have the chance.",1
I had not been to Disney Land since 1986 and I was so glad I got to go again! This trip was on the front end of a business trip and we had two days to play. The cast members were friendly and helpful (not as good as Florida but still good) The rides were fun and my wife and I felt like kids again.,1
"I've been here about 10 times over the years. This lime I went with my daughter, partner and granddaughter. I doubt I'll ever go again. It's very crowded even when it's not crowded. It's expensive. The dead presidents fly out of your wallet like crazy   starting at the parking  $16Food too is expensive. Go to Subway or Whole Foods and pick up sandwiches before you go. If you are with young kids, there are many more ride options. We stuck to Splash Mountain, Matterhorn, Space Mt, Captain EO. Wanted to go on Indiana jones but the wait was an hour. Our handicap pass helped speed things up on some, not all, rides. Without it, line waits were typically 45 60 minutes. Sometimes the waits are much longer. Disneyland can use a facelift. If you've been going over many years, nothing has changed much. But I loathe crowds, so that's a deal breaker for me.",1
Older rides here many still very good California adventure is awsome! very expensive to eat onsite. be sure they take your picture the first time you enter the park!,1
"Fantastic place to visit with small children. Lots of rides for little ones, our daughter is 4, and lots of rides that are safe for children but a little more exciting for the adults. The queues weren't as bad as we expected, the most we queued for being around 50 minutes. Lots of places to eat quickly, but some quite limited in the fare they offered. Nice restaurants available for a better class of food, but make sure you book a day in advance. Can't think of many downsides, only really speed of service generally, normal in France I think. ",1
"I stayed here on 4th May 2009 with my husband and two sons (aged 4 and 2) for 3 nights. We stayed in the Jesse James block   (no lift?) The attention to detail was fantastic. It was a little tacky but we loved it and it was ideal for children. My son loved the top bunk. There was a long queue to check in but other than that the hotel was faultless. The sandpit kept the boys entertained in the evening.Having read other peoples advice we chose to go to breakfast at 7.30 every day. After 8am there were hardly any tables left. There was masses of food available and decent coffee juice etc. We booked a half board option although on the down side as the park closed at 7pm, and most restaurants closed by 6pm, we used the vouchers for lunch on 2 of the days we stayed. Annette's diner in the Disney village was good but service was very slow. Try to get there at least 15mins before the park closes. Agrabah cafe in the park served fabulous food and the setting was really pretty. We also ate at the Cafe to the Stars (Ratatouille cafe) in the Walt Disney Studios but it was no where near as good. We booked Eurodisney and Eurostar separately and found it to be cheaper than booking it directly despite the various offers of staying and playing for free   40% off etc We didn't book a seat for our 2 year old and found that there was lots of spare seats on the train.All the staff in the hotel and throughout the park were really helpful, friendly and all spoke English fluently.Drinks are currently 3.50 euros for a coke water fanta etc we bought a guide book which suggested buying lunch in the railway station (a couple of mins walk outside the park) A draught beer and glass of wine cost 12 euros at the hotel.We'd definitely stay here again.",1
"Love, Love, Love Disneyland. Everything about it! The land scraping and gardening in the park is stunning. I could spend all day walking around and looking at all of the trees and flowers.",1
"It was my first time in Disneyland and I had such a good time. This place offers such a unique experience and now I finally know what the Disney hype is all about.Prince Charming is beautiful... I caught a glimpse of him at the parade and almost fainted.I loved the fact that the staff that sells balloon allows you to take photos with the bundle  a great photo op that doesn't require waiting an hour in line. The characters are hard to catch and the lines are always very long  but there are so many other things to keep you interested.***OH, and a small pie of pizza is $40 (doesn't even taste good)... you are allow to bring in your own food and drinks  which I really recommend because you'll save a lot of money.",1
Always love the Disney experience but it is getting very expensive. The food is overpriced and not that good. Disney has a long way to go in that area. We walked out of the park and ate off property. Even Downtown Disney is overpriced and not that good.....30 dollars for a terrible pizza that was not enough for 4.,1
"Visited Disney this Halloween season and even there was not many changes over last years, it's still Disney with all great magic. Kids loved it. Queues very long but worth it. Fab time for kids",1
"We travelled here for my birthday, we had such a fantasstic time, the atmosphere was just amazing the shows were fabvulous and so much work was put into them. I loved all the disney shops i have to say i was in my element, disney characters for you to meet and greet just a wonderful few days here, highely recommend!!!",1
We went outside of the holidays so did not have to queue too much especially with fast pass system.  Parade and firework work display were excellent. Girls loved getting character autographs although would not want to queue for any longer to see them.,1
First time visit and it was just brilliant. From as soon as we walked in our kids were mesmerised with every aspect of the disney park experience. From the characters to the rides the hardworking very helpful staff it was just a wonderful experience. The parade was brilliant and the fireworks and animation show at the end of the night was amazing. We are definitely going to come again. ,1
"My friend and I went for her 19th birthday because she'd never been to a Disney park before despite her being a massive Disney fan. As I've done Orlando and Paris before I could help her prepare for the trip so she was prepared for how expensive things in the park could be. Despite the rain we did everything we could including watching the parade and the 25th anniversary show even staying from opening time to the closing time to watch the incredible illuminations show. We ate in the actual park on one day and chose to save our money on the second and ate in Disney village at McDonald's. I got home on the Friday, showed my mum all my pictures and on the Saturday we had booked for us two to go back to Disneyland in March next year. Definitely a week I'll never forget as my first girls holiday with the highlights being the rides and the illuminations show. ",1
"We have been to many of the theme parks in Southern California but as far as the level of the cast members, cleanliness of the parks and amenities Disney has the best of the best!",1
"It starts at the entry gate; it's the same for the rest of the day. Lineups that could last close to an hour. You'll learn about the Fast Pass pretty quick as that will permit you to return at a predetermined time range such as 11:50 to 12:50.Food prices? I had read reviews that mentioned $5 water   we didn't see that. Prices are high but not outrageous. Quality is good and it beats packing sandwiches.Security? They'll check your bags before you enter the park and they may call you for secondary as they did 2 of 3 times that I entered. There, you'll walk through a metal detector, empty your pockets, etc. It's all good.Rides? We all did all the major ones, they're good. See my review of Universal Studios!People? Lots of older folk and lots of young preschoolers hence lots of strollers and motorized scooters for the infirm, and overweight!Parade? Get a spot on the curb one hour ahead or risk standing behind a 6'6  and his equally tall son. Seriously, pick your spot early AND pick it nearer the entrance exit to permit a fast exit when it ends. Some will stay for the fireworks but many will bolt when it ends. Hope this helps.",1
"As i know this Disneyland is the smallest one in the world. I had visited Tokyo one before I visited here and my experience in Tokyo wasn   t that good, thus i only had a small expectation about it. But i really enjoyed here, attraction were much better than Tokyo one. The best attraction i enjoyed is Mystic manor which i felt kind of childhood innocent. The do not miss Mini Lion King musical! It   s really worth to watch! ",1
"Our family of nine enjoyed Disneyland this week! One of the best parts of the vacation for me was that I could bring my 7 pound Pallion. He stayed at Disneyland Kennel Club. The cost is $20 a day which is from 7:30 am until 12:30 am. You should bring your dogs favorite toy(s) & blanket. I also brought his food dish and his food, but they have food & food dishes on site. You will need to come in from time to time to take your dog out for a potty break (they do not do this for you). The area for the break is pretty big, but it is not grassy. I was very happy to be able to bring my dog to Disneyland! Check online or directly on what shot paperwork they need from your vet.As stated before wear comfortable shoes, use LOTS of sunscreen, stay hydrated. I used a hip pack, it worked great. The large store in downtown Disney sells very nice hip packs for $16.00. They are large and have 3 zippered comparments. I bought one for our next visit.",1
"So many amazing things to do, rides for all ages.  We had 3 generations and there was something for everyone.  Characters were amazing.",1
"Hate Disney's corporate thing, but if you can leave that at the door, you'll have a fantastic time. Twilight Zone Tower of Terror and Space Mountain 2 have left us battered and bruised but wouldn't have missed them. Tip   wait until about 5pm before you go to Adventure Land, as it closes at 7pm to set the fireworks for the evening, but most people think it shuts earlier. Hence no queues for the rides. Pirates of the Caribbean took us less than ten minutes to board. Horribly expensive food everywhere though. Take a packed lunch. Admission is steep too, but ultimately worth it.",1
"I LOVED my time at Disneyland Paris. So easy to get to from Montmarte by rail, it was raining but we still had a great day full of fun. The diner we went to was lovely, I got a lovely salad and yogurt at a reasonable price, despite hearing different. Queues were wild, we waited 2.5hrs in Thunder Mountain, but it's expected in theme parks. Overall was magical for me as a 22yr old!",1
"We spent one day at Disneyland Park on June 12th, 2012. We couldn't ask for better weather and the park was not overly crowded. We had lost out wallet in the Disneyland Park, and didn't realize it was lost until we got back to the room. There was a very kind person that day in the park who turned in our wallet to guest services. We wanted to thank the person, but they didn't leave their name. Remember to always pay it forward because you never no when you will be in the same situation.We had made reservations at the blue bayou, since we hadn't tried the restaurant in over 5 years. I couldn't believe the price of a monte cristo sandwich, it was $24.95 per person. I have always liked the ambiance of sitting in the restaurant but that kind of price we can have better food elsewhere.",1
"A great day of simple fun and thrills. Bring cash, nothing is cheap, but we knew that it's Disney. But they are great letting you bring in your own food, drinks, etc but read the list closely, we list several items at the entry gates (selfy sticks, glass refill bottles, etc). It is worth buying the photo pass and fastpass. Have fun! ",1
"Having been several times now and am never disappointed. The parades and nightime fireworks are really worth seeing. Be sure to get fasttrack tickets for Buzz Lightyear and Space Mountain, they are not to be missed. Pirates of the Carribean and the Haunted Mansion are a little out of the way and don't ten to have the longest queues, so make a point of going on these too.",1
"Came to The Happiest Place on Earth and what can I say, it was awesome. Kids had a blast, parades were super. Fireworks were outstanding!! Wish some of the other families and people that are there were a bit more considerate, but, that's not Disney's fault. ",1
Nothing really new in the Magic Kingdom from the previous year when we were here. Indiana Jones ride down most of the day so we didn't get to do that. Crowds were terrible later in the day. The Haunted Mansion is always a treat at holiday time as is the parade. Our favorite part of the park is New Orleans Square. Great atmosphere and food. ,1
Love tomorrow land and adventure land most. Make sure u have planned well with the Fast Pass on the Star Tours and Indiana Jones ride.,1
"An amazing experience with something for everyone. Our son is 5 enjoyed loads of rides, as did we. Very clean and well organized, loads of shops and eating options. The Disney parade was great and the castle show at closing time was truly magical. I would say you need at the very least a couple of days to get round both parks, we had 3 days and there were still a couple of things we didn't get round to. Taking a push chair was a great tip, even though it's been years since we used one for my son who is 5 now, as there is so much walking it meant he didn't get so tired and if he wanted a nap he slept in the pram instead of going back to the hotel. Loads of places to leave the prams when you go on a ride.",1
"We went on the 29th of September 2015. unfortunately while we were there 6 of the best rides where not functioning at one point or another or the whole day. Although we did not find a lot of queues it was frustrating not to be able to visit RC Racer, Indiana Jones, Tower of Terror, parachute drop, slinky dog, Armageddon and Studio Tram Tour",1
"Disneyland   was there 25 years ago and back with my daughter this time around. Still awesome   staff serving you with food, giftshops or on rides or just generally on there way from A to B around the park were very very friendly and happy. It was an absolute joy to re visit.",1
"OK OK. For both adults and kids alike, it can be the happiest place on earth after the sticker shock of the prices of admission and food in the park. After the first day (Friday afternoon), it took a while for me to get over the huge crowds and long lines.We came prepared and brought our own food so we didn't have to pay the inflated food prices in the park. We did indulge in a few churros and mickey mouse ice cream bars.The lines for rides were between 20 and 65 minutes depending on the ride. A word of warning, the peter pan ride was always long. Overall a great place to take the family and we all had a great time!",1
"For first time visitor, please do remember to collect all the print seals from every cartoons characters and take 1 to 1 picture with them.Many people missed the activities and end up regret for it. Luckily i still manage to get the signature and print seal from my favorite Donald Duck. And one more thing to do please do not shy when you in Disneyland. Enjoy dancing on the street and singing with your cartoon character to the fullest!Did i forgot to say there is amazing fireworks at around 8pm everyday?",1
"Could not justify paying for a Disney Hotel in the Park with four people, so we stayed a few blocks away at the Residence Inn by Marriott   there is a shuttle stop on property every 20 minutes ($8 per person per day) which was fine. We got great advice at the Hotel which was to be at the Park at least 30 minutes before it opens at 8:00 a.m. and go straight to the line for a Fast Pass for your favorite ride. Then you can go wait in line for the other rides   the lines are not bad until 10:00 to 10:30 a.m. We did 5  rides by that time. After that, expect 1 hour wait times unless you have a Fast Pass, but you can only get 1 pass per ticket on 2 hour block. We started at California Adventure and by mid afternoon we went across the plaza to Disneyland. We did every ride we wanted to do at least once in 2 days by starting early.",1
A must go for a fun day. Many fun rides and show available and not forgetting the awesome fireworks at night. Do not miss the fireworks as it's super amazing. Remember to get some cute souvenirs too  before leaving.,1
"My boyfriend paid for a surprise trip to Paris including a two day pass to Disneyland.I was so excited having visited once before when I was around 9 years old.Seeing cinderellas castle as you approach is beautiful.However I was disappointed that no disney characters are free to roam around the park, instead you have to queue to have a picture with them.The rides were very good, highly recommend Space Mountain) and only had to queue for the Buzz Lightner ride for a long time (1 hour)I thoroughly enjoyed our time in Disney however we had seen everything in one day so did not return for the second day. Can understand the higher appeal for young children, therefore will not visit again without the excited imagination of a young child to accompany me! ",1
"This place is everything that you have dreamed of   so many attractive rides, shows, your favourite characters coming to see you. It's truly the place where dreams come alive even though you pay a steep price for it. What I liked apart from the usual things is that the restrooms were clean. The Disney merchandise stores were so many & had so much variety. It was a happy place & was a good place to spend my holidays.",1
"They certainly do it up right. Whether you're in the original Disneyland, Disney's California Adventure or Downtown Disney,  these guys are the best at what they do!  Be sure to check out  Soarin' Over California , Star Tours, and the new Racing Car ride...my person favourites!",1
"World of color is amazing! There's no water show like it, and it just brings you back to some of disney classic movies and even some of the newer movies disney has made. Fireworks show is always great... they change the show about every month so you're not stuck watching the same firework sequence every time you visit. Beautiful and always coordinated just right to the perfect disney songs. The holiday firework show is my favorite so far. I definetely recommend getting the (socal if you live in southern california) season pass. If you get a pass and don't like staying at the park the entire day (it get's tiring), there's 3 hour free parking at downtown disney. Rides wise, I like California Adventure better (tower of terror, midway mania, and california screamin'). But Disneyland is definitely more classic with the fireworks show, indiana jones, and space mountain. Either park you choose to go to you, you're bound to have a great time.",1
We've never been to any other Disneyland so we have nothing really to compare it with.But where we come from there isn't any theme park as brilliant as this. The Mystic Manor ride and Grizzly Gulch is a must. We really enjoyed ourselves and I would say a day is enough to see everything. The 3 pm parade was spectacular and so was the night one.The fireworks on closing was stunning. A must see if your in Hong Kong.,1
"We had a Great time with our kids here.  Lines were fine, not to long. Our third trip with our kids and they finally got to ride Indiana Jones.  Park is always clean and staff has always been helpful.",1
"We love Disneyland! It's a great place to have fun as a family. My best advice: take a mid day nap, off site. Here are some of my thoughts as you plan:  Be informed, there are many apps these days that can help choose the best days to go with the least crowded times, and the line waiting times for each ride once you are there. You can find schedules of all shows on line before you arrive. These are also at the main gate each morning. Keep one. Also get a map.  Stay in a hotel close by so you can take breaks during the lunch time rush to swim and nap! Take advantage of the early hours and the late times if you can. Bring 1 extra outfit for little ones so they can get wet in the water play areas.   The parades and light shows are spectacular. They are very loud if you are up close, but if the sounds don't scare your family, then the closer the better. Often, you can be chosen to participate if you are close enough. You need to find a good spot and sit there for 30 45 minutes before a show starts.  Stay hydrated.   Plan your budget to include a few fun snacks. Our favorite snack is the Lemonade Ice. Our favorite place to eat is in New Orleans under the Pirates of the Caribbean ride, a place called  Harbour Galley  which serves soup in bread bowls. Yum!  Try to go to both parks, Disneyland and California Adventure, but if you can only make it to one, choose Disneyland, especially with younger kids. All the traditional themes and rides you hear about are in Disneyland. But, California Adventure is not to be missed either...like Soarin, or the  Bugs Life  area, the new  Cars  area are spectacular.   You get the best bang for your buck if you go for at least 3 days. Our family only goes 1 or 2 days each visit to L.A., but we know exactly where we are going and we know we will be back to see what we have missed on our next trip.It's a bit overwhelming if you have never been and want to take advantage of the money you paid for admission. Again, my best advice, after 40  visits, is to take a break at mid day.",1
"Excellent & My kids age 11, 6 & 3 enjoyed the park very much. Disneyland has rides for both younger children & also older kids. We went on Tuesday & the park wasn't very busy. The que for rides was pretty fast & we waited about 15 20 minutes on average. I have been to Disneyland HK a couple of times. The last time was in Nov 2009. This time around, they added 2 new parks, Toy Story land & Grizzly Gulch. One day is barely enough if you really go for all rides show taking into consideration of waiting time for each ride, depend on the day (weekday weekend, school holiday etc) you are going. You might want to get a 2 days entrance pass (Adult HK$499, Child HK$355) & stay in Disneyland Hotel or Disney's Hollywood Hotel for a night. One day entrance pass is Adult HK$399 & Child HK$285. Children below 3years old is free.The firework at 8pm was awesome! It worth the wait.",1
"No one does this kind of attraction like Disney does. The replication of the Radiator Springs and the surrounding area is beyond description. We went during the  slowest weeks of the year . Thank goodness because I hate crowds. There seemed to be a lot of break downs in California Adventure the day we were there which cause a rift in our plans and made for some extra walking. Numerous rides including the coaster were on and off all day. (safety first).I agree with  claucrasoda  who said  if you are not a patient person or dislike crowds then stay away....  We have a special needs child but even with a guest assistance pass there are waits and disappointments. If you have a child under 40  tall DO NOT get in line until you make sure they can ride rather than find out after waiting in line. If the child is close to 40  put a pair of shoes on them with thick souls and heals. Disney DOES NOT make exceptions to the height requirements.Disneyland is NOT inexpensive. You won't enjoy it if you are worried about how much things cost there. Plan ahead, over budget and enjoy. If you pay $7 for a corn dog just know that it is the best corn dog in the world :)",1
"It doesn't matter whether you are a young child, or a grown up  big kid,  the Disneyland Park is great fun and truly magical for kids of all ages. It's a place that just makes people smile and have a good time.Unsurprisingly, it can be really busy, especially during the Summer holiday period and when the sun is shining, but provided that you plan your day, decide what you wish to do and see, take advantage of the  Fast Pass  opportunities, and book your restaurant visits, etc., it really is a great experience.There was one slight blemish though; as someone who has visited Disneyland, Paris on a number of occasions over the years, there was a noticeably higher occurrence of rides being temporarily closed due to  technical faults  than I have witnessed previously. I have no idea whether this was just bad luck or an unfortunate coincidence or whether the maintenance programme needs to be improved, but whatever the reason, it did appear that certain rides, such as Big Thunder Mountain, Space Mountain and It's A Small World, suffered more than their fair share of temporary closures.",1
"...because it really is entirely magical. I don't care if it's expensive to get to, visit, stay nearby or eat there, or if the crowds are big & lines are long   it is still absolutely amazing!!! I first visited here 19 years ago & dreamed that one day I'd get to bring my future kids here   & it was every bit as amazing as I'd hoped. The whole family (mum, dad, 11 & 6 year old kids) enjoyed this place SO much :) My biggest 4 tips to visiting the parks would be: 1) stay at one of the Disneyland Hotels if you can   they really make the holiday perfect, are literally on the doorstep of the parks (so no stress with transport parking etc), AND give you the early hour entry to boot. Awesome. 2) don't visit on a weekend or public school holidays if you can help it. We were there mon sat & it was busy enough on the weekdays, saturday was insane! 3) book in a character breakfast or dinner for your first day at the park. A bit expensive, but there is great food & you get a whole bunch of different Disney characters (different at each of the four restaurants, so read up on them to find your favourites!) who will walk around your tables, play with your kids, sign autograph books & take as many photos as you want. This will save you queuing in the park for up to an hour PER character (!!!!)   this is annoying & takes up valuable visiting time! 4) figure out & use the fast passes. I know everyone harps on about it on here, but they really are awesome once you figure out how to use them. We found that we all were much happier patient if queuing only every second ride, & using fast passes in between where possible.Anyway, I hope everyone gets the chance to visit once in their lifetimes! We are already saving up to go back again in a few years once the new Star Wars area is open fully ;) ",1
"This is my 3rd or 4th time here and my 1st review. We started at the entrance main street USA, and that has only shopping. Going anti clockwise to tomorrow land, we did the traditional Disney space mountain ride. This is 1 of the only 3 thrill rides at Disney HK, some we relished itNext is fantasy land and we took the slow boat in  it's a small world  , which is basically a doll fetish's fantasy land. The world is split into many sections continents and there are hundreds of dressed up dollsAdventure land has my favorite  festival of the lion king  show. The classic Elton John soundtrack, the visuals, acrobatic acts are top qualityToy story land has the 2nd thrill ride RC racer, basically a roller coaster that swings back and forth like a pendulumGrizzly gulch has the 3rd thrill ride  big grizzly mine cars , which is a roller coaster that only moves backward for a bitWe also saw the flights of fantasy street parade which has most of the Disney characters on show. It was nice and the music was fun to shake toWe then took the railroad train back to the entrance, the ride was painfully slow and we saw mostly trees due to the design of the railroadOverall, we liked the thrill rides and we both are adults and I guess the kids will like the other rides. The thrill rides can't compare to those at 6 flags or universal but we shouldn't compare apples with oranges. We went on a weekday and the lines were not long",1
"No matter the season,  Disney is fantastic, but especially during the holidays, it's worth a visit. The only drawbacks are the large crowds and higher price of the entry ticket.",1
"Totally loved it here, first ever visit I took my children and my grandchildren and we all loved it, plenty to see do, very clean well looked after, beautiful gardens, the Parades are a must to watch all the characters people are fantastic you can see how much they are loving what they do. Plenty of places to eat drink, although expensive. Loads of shops selling loads of Disney toys etc a lot you just would get back at home.",1
"Amazing park, wish lines are not so long during spring break. Kids are always super excited everytime we visit.",1
But I did fall in love with Disneyland after I visited it. Everyone in the park easily look like they are living in a wonderland fairyland. The rides are not horrible. How could I not like a place like this.,1
"The parks are wonderful, everyone knows that, but for years I was so focused on the rides, I missed the shows. There are lots of them to choose from, they're all free, and the level of talent that Disney is able to draw from is amazing. Every visit now, I try to discover a new one. This visit it was Rick, the honkey tonk piano player on Main Street. This young man is incredibly talented, and a delightful person as well. When he noticed me enjoying his playing, he called me over to sit beside him so I could see his playing more clearly. He had a crowd of children around him, watching his fingers fly over the keys, and took time out to sign autographs for him, too. All in 97'F heat! Fantastic!",1
"Visited here July 2012, June 2013 and booked again for November 2013Such a beautiful theme park. Has Disney magic everywhere! Staff are helpful and most speak multiple languages. The rides are great, if a bit outdated, if you dont mind queuing. There is a fast pass system but you can only get one at a time.Top Attractions are:  Phantom Manor  Big Thunder Mountain  Peter Pans Flight  Star tours  Space Mountain",1
"There were 12 of us on this trip and we had so much fun! Although there are long lines, which is to be expected, the park is always clean, everyone is smiling and staff is always courteous. It truely was a great time!",1
"We unfortunately were there during a horrible heat wave  the temperatures were 105 with a heat index of 112 during our 3 day stay. I know that impacted our experience. But Disneyland could have handled its high paying customers better by providing misters in various locations like so many other parks and attractions do across the country to help cool people down. I asked for ice water at the food locations and was obliged, thank goodness, but that nicety was not publicly known and many people were really suffering the affects of the heat (us included). Why not pass out cups of ice water? That's the kind of nice touch I would expect from  the most wonderful place on earth.  Also, many of the top rides (i.e. Pirates of the Caribbean, Finding Nemo Submarine, and It's a Small World) were either permanently closed or continually shutting down for complications, which made for unhappy children. The food is crazily overpriced and completely not worth it at places like the Blue Bayou (inside the Pirates of the Caribbean cave). We had a Monte Cristo sandwich with bread that was fried like a donut with meat inside and jelly to dip it into. Made us completely feel like hurling and gave us upset stomachs. Did I mention it was $25.50? For a sandwich? I really wish I knew about the Disney dining plan, but honestly we didn't plan to eat there. It's just that the heat drove us to any building with air conditioning so we could cool down and feel sane. We loved the characters like Donald Duck and Mickey and Minnie Mouse who roam the park and allow free pictures taken. We wish the rest of the service workers there had the same kindness and customer service as those dressed in character. I do have to say California Adventure was a pleasant surprise and that we enjoyed almost everything about it. Our only complaint there was the fact that the World of Color light show could be much better run. The show itself is nice but you can't sit down and you literally have to stand for over an hour waiting for and then watching it. After walking all day, standing for that long is miserable. An outdoor amphitheater would be fabulous.",1
We apparently picked the worst time to visit. :( it rained everyday we were there and they had just closed two rides to take down Christmas decorations: the haunted mansion and the jungle cruise. I was really bummed because we had wanted to see the haunted mansion all dressed up. We still had loads of fun and they can't control the weather. Didn't realize they don't have an evening firework show except a few nights a week. Overall takeaway is I wish I would have planned better. We have been to Disney world over 10 times and there was really no comparison to it in my opinion. I didn't like how there was no meal plan or fast passes link that we have grown accustomed to at Disney world. ,1
"We had three day park hopper tickets for Disneyland and California Adventure Park. I thought Disneyland was kind of old and outdated but the kids loved it so if they're happy, then I'm happy. The lines are really long for the rides and attractions and everything is expensive from the food to the t shirts and everything in between. The corn dogs are awesome though and I would pay the inflated entrance fee just for another hand dipped corn dog. It's best to go on a weekday during the off season and show up early to enjoy the park. The parade is really cool but they need to update the characters as there are a lot of new Disney characters that the kids want to see. All of the characters are from my childhood and not for the kids today. I also wish they had more chances to get your picture with the characters. They appear randomly and the lines get long fast.",1
"Easily accessible by train. You can walk from the station and it takes hardly 7 8 minutes. If you reach early just as it opens and plan your trip on a weekday, you can see the entire park and do all the rides in one day, with time to spare. We actually had time to sit and laze around with a cup of coffee while our daughter jumped around. The food options are pretty limited and expensive, so better to carry your own soft drinks. They cost about 30 HKD in the park. Staff is courteous, as expected from a Disneyland, rides are safe and nice. But it's much smaller than the USA ones and that was a disappointment. Buy tickets on klook to save money.",1
What do you say. Everything was spot on. I'd been there before but my wife hadn't. We stayed for the Grand Parade and Fanfasmic. If I had to complain I'd say   to many kids  ..........LOL.  A fantastic place.,1
"Disneyland all over never ceases to amaze. We started with the  It's small world  ride, which is Christmas theme and then to the rest of the rides.We managed to time they uses with the fastpass timing and everything went without a hitch.There were new shows like the  Finding Nemo  submarine ride and  Star Wars  rides.We were however disappointed with the cancellation of the night time fireworks but they replaced it with a musical light show of the castle. One tip;  you can take the single rider pass, that will let you bypasss all the queues but ride individually and not with any partner. ",1
"Ever since I was a kid I have desperately wanted to go to Disneyland, always imagining how good it would be. So at 27 years old the day finally arrived when I along with my wife, 3 tiny children and the in laws descended on Disneyland Park for one truly amazing day and it was better than I ever imagined. The kids loved it, my wife loved it, the in laws loved it and I definitely loved it! We just went for one day so cannot comment on how it would be to stay for longer but on that one day we crammed in as much as we could and still didn't manage to do it all even being there from park opening to closing. There is so so so much to do. The closing ceremony fireworks show was flat out the best sound and light display you will see and the rides fill needs for all ages! Our particular ride highlights were Big Thunder Mountain, Pirates of the Caribbean and Peter Pans Flight. Alice's curious labyrinth was also a great chance to relive Classic Disney moments. Now on the food matter, it's Disneyland so don't expect a hearty lunch for a fiver as it is pricey but the vendor carts can provide a slightly cheaper alternative if you're on a day visit. The staff were incredibly helpful, friendly and the cast really got into the spirit of things for the kids. Our son and daughter were dressed as Peter Pan and Tinkerbell so got special attention from the 'real' Peter, Wendy, Tinkerbell and random pirates. Plus they got free fast pass access on the Peter Pans Flight ride. Being there for the one day we didn't spend much time shopping but the shops we did visit were filled with all sorts of interesting Disney memorabilia and souvenirs. Will I go back? I sincerely hope so!",1
Love love love it. Kids and adults a like. We got the 5 day park hopper pass and so glad we did as we didn't have to rush anything . If you can afford the long stay I would recommend it. Everything I dreamed of as a child and more . ,1
A brilliant atmosphere on this street. You need to take your places early for the parade and the firework display in the evening. The castle is truly magical.,1
it was a very pleasent visit and we intend to repeat it. warning: one day is tight. really have to experience sleep over.,1
"I don't think there is much I can add that hasn't been said already. Magical for the kids and the French have done a great job of making it feel like the US parks (I think).Very busy at Halloween   expect to queue for any food and all rides. The park looked beautiful in October's autum colours.Hints:Use the Fast Pass system to avoid queuing. Read up about it and get the most out of it. The  Magic Hours    the parks don't open till ten, but residents of Disney hotels can get in from 8am. This might seem like a good deal, but there's very little open at 8am, and most of the rides don't open till ten. Enjoy a lie in instead.Disney at night: Make sure you go after sun down   Disney has a whole different atmosphere after dark and it looks stunning.",1
"This is a place for the little set as there's just not much for teens. The teens in our party took off for Knott's Berry Farm while we did Disney with the 6 & 7 year olds. Be for warned that a lot of the rides are cars going into dark places with super loud music and lit up characters. My high functioning autistic son couldn't take this. The simple rides around mainstreet were the answer for stress relief...horse pulled trolley, old fire truck and double decker bus. Super yummy corn dog vendor just off mainsreet.",1
"I travel to Disneyland Paris every year and the Disneyland Park is always excellent: from the rides which are always kept in good conditions (which, I believe, go through a refurbishment at least once a year), to the seasonal themes and anniversaries. Halloween themed park is wonderful, and I would recommend to see the Christmas season, which starts early in November and adds even more magic to the park. This year is the 20th Anniversary of Disneyland Paris, so there are special shows like  Disney Dreams!  that you should not miss! The park is divided in 5 different areas: Main Street, Frontierland, Adventureland, Fantasyland and Discoveryland. The atmosphere is magical and different in each one of them, with the music and surroundings completely unique to each small area.Do not expect the resort to be as big as Walt Disney World in Florida, for example! Though the Disneyland park is  small , it offers a big variety of rides (Pirates of the Caribbean, Phantom Manor & Big Thunder mountain being our favorites). The staff is friendly in the restaurants, boutiques and rides; and the park is also clean considering the huge amount of people that goes there every day.To avoid crowds, there are, of course, the Fast passes (normal ones that come with your hotel reservations and VIP ones, which they provide with  Castle Club  rooms or suites), but also strategic dates which can make you skip long waiting times! I would recommend weekdays (between Tuesdays and Fridays) in less busy periods, such as the end of september, may or june (you should first check that there are not holidays in France!) and also some days in november (though the weather is already colder). During these less busy periods, the prices are also usually lower.If you are planning to go there more than once a year, there is the  Passeport Annuel  (or Annual Passport) which offers discounts on restaurants, hotels and of course, free admission in the parks (beware of the restriction dates!). As for the hotel, the best one in my opinion is the Disneyland Hotel (though a bit more expensive than the other ones), located at the very entrance of the park!Whether you travel with young children, teenagers, as a couple or with friends, the Disneyland Park is an experience you should not miss.",1
"Best park for me, arrive early and head to back of park.  Food prices are decent and it is so much fun watching your kids eyes.  But autograph book and let kids gets character signatures they will love it.",1
Only we visited when they had disney running days it was sooooo busy likes were could get in early and staying here was close to parks,1
"We visited Disneyland for 3 days from the 26th September 2013. We had a really good time with our 3 year old. The weather was hot and for all 3 days we were able to enjoy the park without all the pushing and shoving we expected. As we went mid week it wasn't as busy as we had anticipated. Our daughter loved it and was certainly not too small for this experience at all.We found the queues to be moderate but on most of the rides were given the opportunity to go straight through and enjoy the ride with our whole party due to a disability pass. I was worried that the member of our party with the disability would not be able to experience most of the rides due to her wheelchair but most brilliantly she was accommodated on all but 1 occasion (Peter pans flight due to height and evacuation risk). This was excellent as it meant we could all share in my daughters 1st experience of Disneyland and made our trip even better and certainly a lot less stressful.We saw lots of characters during our visit walking around the park posing for photos and giving autographs including Mickey and Minnie, Buz, Mr Smee, Jack Sparrow (whom was very funny walking along like a crazy drunk) Winnie the Poo, Tigger, Chip & Dale, Goofy and Donald. We did not however see any princes's which would have been lovely. Having said that we saw them all during the parade and the main characters again on the celebration train. The Dreams show was the highlight of our trip, it was truly magnificent from start to finish and I only wish could see it again. We also went to see the Animaguque show wich was wonderful and my daughter found the floating fish and bubbles to be a brilliant addition.This trip was amazing , the food, the shows ( we also did Buffalo Bills ) the cast members, the characters, the music. It all made for a brilliant family holiday. The park itself is kept spotless and their are plenty of toilets providing you make the most of them when you see them. As for restaurants Disney village is the best place to go, they have everything to suite every taste and budget. I would recommend the Rainfirest caffe as this again was great fun. I found the cost of things here to be as expected, expensive!! we had done extensive homework before we went and knew that we needed to be prepared to pay over the odds but just seeing my daughters face was worth every penny and we all work hard so why not enjoy it as much as you can. Be prepared to come away with blisters on blisters, and singing  Magic Everywhere  over and over again lol.Would we go again ? Yes because we had a magical time and having been once before whilst at school it still hasn't lost any of it's charm, infact it's got even better. I would recommend you plan your days before you go and make use of all the forums in order to get as much information as possible. This really helped us and as a result we hardly missed anything that was suitable for our daughter. Brilliant holiday thankyou Disney!",1
"Grand kids loved it, can't get over the looks on their faces when they saw the princesses, ball, mickey, buzz lightyear ride, the parade, the light show etc.Some tips.The light show is fantastic and worth going to disney just to see it. I won't give too much away but imagine the palace being turned into a huge TV! Get there a couple of hours before the start, as near to the front as you can because you need to see the bottom of the palace. Take some cushions because you will be sitting on the floor! as with all these events people will be turning up 5 minutes before the start and looking for a space at the front.The parade.first time we saw it we got a decent spot at the end about an hour before the start. We got really annoyed with adults getting there late and pushing their way in front of us, or adults pushing their children to the front blocking the view of our own. The second time we saw it, again we were there early but stood our ground when people arrived late and tried to push past. For some reason they were annoyed with us?restaurants.We went half board which was excellent value.Do not book a table at the Plaza Garden straight after the parade, it is extremely busy! If you do, be aware that there are two queues, reservation are on the left, but there is no sign until you are at the desk. All restaurants want to know your free soft drink when you hand over your voucher, so if there are a lot of you in your party, 12 in ours, write it down.Airport Transfer.We had pre booked this from CDG to Santa Fe and back.10 of us arrived at 1600 and had no problem. Two arrived at 2200 to find the shuttle had stopped at eight. However, disney had taken our money and they ask you for the flight details so knew it they were arriving at ten .The day before we left I asked whether we had to reserve a seat and were told no. The driver was not going to let us on as he said there were only 11 empty seats and 12 in our party. we got on because he could not count, Not sure what happens if the coach is full, they recommend leaving at least 2 hours before check in opens, the next coach would have been too late.Final thoughtsWe are all trying to decide when to go back!",1
"We visited disneyland early in the morning. The place is a wonderful place to visit wherein the advisable thing as per many people is that you enter and reach the far end immediately. As the tourists after entering normally get customed to characters, take pics, it is always advisable to reach the far end immediately, take the quick rides and then come back to the main area.There are 7 different areas in the disneyland wherein 3 attractions have a priority pass. Just enter your ticket in the pass machine and get a designated time. You will find good shorter line for you if you enter through pass. Remember there are NO EXTRA charges for the pass. All you have to do is to go to the attraction and obtain a priority pass by the automated vending machines available there.One of the attractions Manor house is a place wherein it is a long queue and appears to be just like a collection of old artifacts whereas when you reach the roller coaster, the entire thing changes. Do visit the same. Lovely.If you love thrill, do not leave mine train. It really gives a good feel and a sort of unique thrilling experience (Particularly reverse direction)Do enjoy the lion king show.Many more wonders.Lovely place.If you can walk continuously have a one day pass else have a two day pass.Love water, enjoy the evening parade which is filled of water.",1
"Anaheim's Disneyland is so much fun for the family. More compact and easier to navigate than Disney World, and you can stay at affordable hotels within 10 minutes of walking distance. You do not need to rent a car, and can easily leave when kids tire out , then return when your family is recharged.",1
Had the most amazing 4days at disneyland. They made my son who has special need and in a wheelchair feel like a Prince. Made everything easy and super friendly,1
"It was my first time and it was magical! My cousin who's with us said I was like a kid again seeing my disney princesses and all the characters. My favorite part was the rides tho, especially the roller coaster         ",1
"No need to introduce more about disneyland, everybody will love and feel like a kids again. If you bring a family with kids its a MUSTTTT visit ! put down all you stress and enjoy it!",1
"This is my first ever disney experience! The sceneries, atmosphere, and the settings are def incredible! Waited 2 hours to take photos with the Princess. So much things to see, so much characters to meet, and I think the parade of the characters were little short though. A great day ends with the magical show at night before closing. We also spent some time going over to the Disney studios for rides! Overall, I feel like I'm back to my childhood days, really had a great time. A day is really not enough!",1
"Atmosphere, atractions and shopping all great. Just wonderful to sit and watch. Great for people watching and great for fun.",1
"This is still one of the most fun and safe places to visit for all ages. They have rides for all ages. Exciting and gentle. The Disney characters can't help but make you smile and no one does a parade like Disney. Even the fire works are extra special. Something for everyone. Adventureland, New Orleans Square are our two most favourite lands. Love the Pirates, Haunted Mansion . We bought a two day pass and also went over to California Adventure where we went on Soarin' Over California. A great experience over all. The one day we didn't go to a park there was enough to do in Downtown Disney and the hotels. Everyone should experience a Disney Park at least once in their life.",1
My son and nephew enjoyed the parade so much! He stared and tried uttering words at 2 years old. He just couldn't contain his happiness. I got teary eyed watching it.,1
"We have just returned from 2 wonderful days at DLP. Admittedly one of our party was in a wheelchair so this meant that we did not have to queue for some of the attractions but the park was not as busy as we had expected so the queues were not too bad. We arrived at the park at 9am and at this time there were very few people there so we were able to get straight on the rides we wanted to do without waiting at all!Aerosmith's Rock and Roller Coaster and Space Mountain are both fantastic and some of our party could have happily spent the entire 2 days just riding them!! Space Mountain has been improved with Mission 2.The cast members varied in how helpful they were, we had to speak to them on most rides because of the wheelchair, and while some of them were lovely, others were real 'jobsworths'. The rule seems to be that a person in a wheelchair can take up to 3 members of their party with them even though there were 9 of us so we had to split up and this usually meant sending a half empty carriage through the attraction. Some of them would let an extra child fill up the empty space and some wouldn't.When we hired the wheelchair we were not told that we needed a blue card to go with it so having got to the rides, we then had to shlep all the way back to City Hall to get one. Here we were told that the card would be fine for visiting the other park the following day, but when we tried to use it in the Disney Studios we were told that no, we needed a green card!We ate at Cafe Mickey with the characters and I don't think I have ever laughed so much! I thought they would just sign autographs and pose for pictures but watch out for Balloo and co   nothing so sedate!! They were fantastic and rounded off our visit with a big smile.If you have a disabled person with you, tell them as you pay for the car park as you need the code to get in and yes, they are sending you into the car park of the hotel that backs onto the entrance, we drove round thinking no, they can't mean in there!",1
"Such a wonderful place!  The evening parade and fireworks are not to be missed....truly special.  Our favorite rides were:  Indiana Jones, Big Thunder Mountain, Pirates, Hyperspace Mountain and the Matterhorn.",1
"We have visited a few Disney properties over the last few years and Hong Kong's Disneyland is much smaller than the other properties but still a great day out. Even during peak Christmas season this meant significantly shorter wait times than we have experienced anywhere else. The transport system is also excellent allowing a very quick trip back to Causeway Bay at the closure of the park. Had a great pho for lunch near Mystic Manor. Merchandise was not at the level we expected with a much clearer focus on providing for children over adults but we think this may have something to do with the fact that the park has only been open 10 years and has not yet reached that second generation of attendees. Given time, this will only continue to improve.",1
"Grandma and Grandpa took our 3 grandkids (ages 8, 11 and 12) to Disneyland for 5 days. We had a wonderful time. We entered the park as soon as they opened everyday. We stayed until it got too crowded in the afternoon and then headed back to our hotel (Paradise Pier) where we hit the pool. Make sure to use those fast passes!",1
We decided to come to Disney to compare it to the parks in Florida where we used to live. It is a small park in comparison which suited us perfectly. We were able to ride all of the rides that were not being maintained and there were no lines. Friendly people!,1
Had so much fun at Disneyland. We found it works great to get there for when the park opens and see as much as possible before early afternoon. We went back to our hotel for a brief nap and recharge and headed back in the evening when the lineups had died down.,1
"We had a great couple of days here. Always lots to see and do. So glad we avoided the weekend, we managed to do every ride!",1
"We went with the whole family and had lots of fun. Rides for all ages, themes and costumes are wonderful. The food could be a little more reasonable in price. Wdid splurge and eat in the famous Blue Bayou it was fantastic!!",1
I love Disneyland. Take advantage of the single rider lines at some of the attractions. You don't want to spend your day in line. Get fast pass to your favorite rides. Ride the grizzly bear river run at night. Just bring a poncho so you won't be freezing cold. The wait time is only 5 minutes and the ride is a little scary at night. Great time to also go on Splash Mountain.,1
"A very lovely, a very, very, hot Disney visit! Had a great day here. Firstly, it is so easy to get to from either Hing Kong Centre or Kowloon, taking the MTR. Got here upon opening and were able to get in a number of rides with minimal wait times. The park has many familiarities of the US sites, similar    lands    so it   s very easy to navigate, although The Hing Kong park seems smaller and more walkable. Rides my kid loved: Space Mountain (a different name), the Toy Story Hot Wheels ride was awesome, and of course we rode the Grizzly Mine Cars about three times. Food: prices approximate to other parks. If it is warm out, bring as much water as you can. If you only want Western food there are some spots to get this. Overall, I would go again. I was thrilled by wait times, but maybe this was just luck. There were a number of characters we didn   t recognize because they are popular with Disney Japan, but this had no impact on us. The castle was very small and undergoing renovations so it   s too bad we missed that. Parade was great. Check for weather, bring water, enjoy! ",1
"Love Disneyland, the original park is the best. loads of great rides and a few originals, eg Mattahorn Bobsleds, Indiana Jones ride & Alice in Wonderland.  Great food choices too.",1
"Everyone compares Hong Kong Disneyland with other Disneylands and calls it small, miniature even. But I like how my Dad puts it, 'compact'. We've been to the Paris Disneyland and in comparison this one definitely dwarfs in size. The walk from Bus station to the park gate in Paris is probably longer than the span of this one. Having said that, they have managed to fit most of the popular rides in Hong Kong Disneyland. And you can't complain about the overall experience in general.Speaking of experience, it starts right with the MTR ride. Waiting at the Sunny Bay MTR stop, one is amazed to see coaches rolling in windows shaped like Mickey mouse. Inside you can find lots of Disney stuff and information so one is in the right spirits even before reaching the park. The park is a small walk away from the MTR stop. I always look at Disneyland from the eyes of my son who is just amazed to find himself amongst Woody, Goofy and Nemo. So after a quick photo op with Buzz Lightyear we started with our rides. All usual rides like Space Mountain and RC Racer were great and thrilling as always. We particularly loved a roller coaster ride called Grizzly tram ride in Mystery land. Enough to do it thrice, which was possible because queues were never too long for any attraction. The park is divided into zones named Toy Story Land, Fantasy Land etc. and the rides include classics like Cup & Saucer in addition to some new ones. They were building an Iron Man ride too, to be unveiled in 2016.Food as always was overpriced. We forgot to carry something with us to eat and a hot Hong Kong day meant lots were spent on food and water inside the park. I guess one has to accept this and not let it come in the way of great Disney experience. Overall, a perfect day spent with smiles all around.",1
"I am an unashamed Disneyland lover.  I makes me feel like a kid again, and who can argue with that?  Be sure not to miss Pirates of the Caribbean, which is the best ride in the park.  (But the Haunted Mansion is a close second.)",1
"Park opens at 10am if you are not residing in the Disney hotels then no point arriving earlier. I was revisiting after a period of 9 years. Big difference was the Disney princesses didn't seem to be wandering the park like the used to, but you had to queue to meet one   and you weren't told which. Much to my surprise we didn't see one all day. Other change was the addition of a frozen sing along where the petting zoo used to be. Kids have frozen sing along parties all the time so my 5 year old wasn't interested. Helpful staff though and well ordered. A kid should visit but perhaps only once..",1
We had a fabulous time at Disneyland. There was so much to do and see it was great! We enjoyed all the rides and love that they had a fast pass to come back and go on rides when they weren't busy. We also loved how organized they were when we wanted to go on the new little mermaid ride. The shows and attractions were fabulous!!,1
"As Disneylands go, this one is very good and much better than the comparable Disneyland Paris (disregarding the studio). In April there were very few queues. Major rides like Space Mountain, Runaway Mine Train and the Buzz Lightyear ride had no queues at all. Also, unlike the Paris park, there's a Safari Cruise Boat ride like in Orlando and a Lion King show   both of which were excellent. Also, very easy to get to by the MTR from central Hong Kong. The special Disney MTR train to the park was exciting in itself.",1
"Despite being one of the smaller parks of the company, two days are really worth while with a five year old and a baby. It is most relaxing as you will find enough time to enjoy. The transfer with the metro and the disney line works like a charme, all super clear signposted. Truly a fun day out with the kids. ",1
"Loved every minute of it, we went around Halloween time which was busier than expected.  Still had a great time, the 6 and 4 year old want to go back every time we talk about our next vacation.",1
My elderly mother and I had an amazing trip to Disneyland they were very accommodating to her wheelchair and the walk in Walts Disneyland footsteps tour was fantastic and I would highly recommend. Both Disneyland and the California Adventure seemed to be plagued with technical problems while we were there. Many of the most popular rides were down for long periods of time which is disappointing when you are trying to plan your day with fast passes. Other then the technical issues we really enjoyed our time at Disney,1
"Going back to Disneyland 9 years later than before hasn't changed. I'm still that excited kid that has her dream come true. This time, the park had been updated with new attractions like the Indiana Jones Adventure and Pirates of the Caribbean, but it still had the same awesome attractions I remember when I was 11 like The Haunted Mansion and Splash Mountain. If you get there early in the day (preferably when it opens) then the lines are not long, the maximum wait we had throughout the day was around 30 minutes. However, these are usually on the popular rides like Space Mountain. Of coarse the rides are targeted at the younger kids, but it's a good time when you're with family.",1
"Amazing, as always! The decor for Halloween was gorgeous.",1
It was a fun day at HK Disneyland. They had lighting of the Christmas tree when we visited and they even let us experience snow! There were a lot of Disney merchandise as usual. They also sold Mickey Mouse pancake which was cute. The line to have a picture with Mickey Minnie Mouse and Donald Daisy Duck and Tigger Sofia the Princess was tooooo long that we had to content ourselves with photobombing them hehe we didnt try the rides at all as that was not our thing. The place is accessible by mtr. ,1
"Our kids aged 5 and 3 really enjoyed this trip, the disney parade which happens every day is not to be missed! Highlights included the Buzz lightyear ride, Star tours and the stars mission ride, Its a Small World, Peter Plan flight, The Haunted House, and the shows that take place throughout the day. Its a lot of fun, but vv busy with long lines at all the rides, so I think the best thing to do when you get there is print of your fastpass tickets at the rides that have fastpass machines then come back at the allotted time and you sail straight through to the rides, its brilliant! Snacks and food is expensive, (7 euros for a doughnut and two cookies!) and a lot of people make sandwiches from the breakfast buffet in their hotel and bring that. But there is every kind of food you could want at the disney parks, from pizza to a la carte. From reading the other reviews I thought smoking would be a real problem but actually people don't smoke in the lines but they do walk around smoking but to be honest it as not as bad as I thought it would be. You will get jostled about on the shuttle buses though, so soon as the doors open get on board don't wait! Its every scurvy pirate for himself!",1
"Been a number of years since I last visited Disneyland. This time was a family tripwith the grandchildren. Park very busy but not overly crowded. Son got fasttracktickets for the rides he and granddaughter wanted to ride. Younger grandson hadonly a few minutes to wait for rides appropriate to his age. It was his first visit andhe loved it especially meeting Mickey Mouse on Toyland. Not cheap, but worth itfor the look on kids faces.",1
"Always always a great place to go. It's been many years since I visited Disney and you can tell based on the prices. We had a great time for our thousand dollars spent for four of us. The prices are really ridiculous especially in this economy. Lines are long and the number of strollers in the park has become astronomical from what I remember. Markings for Fastpass distribution for wheelchair for wheelchair guests are unclear and also very inconvenient. For instance walk all the way to the end of the ride to get a FastPass, just so you can walk all the way back from where you came and regular fast passes are distributed, to go on something else and then walk all the way down again to enter. Huh??? I will say that the park is extremely clean, most of the workers are friendly, and the lines weren't too bad for us using the fast pass. However, as I said earlier, there are so many strollers throughout the park it makes it hard to get around, especially when they let the double wides in. We did not see very many characters all day long walking around the park. You specifically had to go to Main Street or two Minnie or Mickey's house for example. All in all, what can you say it is supposed to be the happiest place on earth,   the crying tired children, we had a wonderful time! ",1
There are many things that I still remember from coming here as a child. The rides are fun as are the parades and characters. Totally worth the money for the  fast pass  on the app. We all enjoyed our time here and we were a group with ages between 4 and 65!,1
We visited for the day and had an excellent time. Staff good but not like the happy cheerful American staff. Not too busy   never waited more than 20 minutes for a ride. Parades good. Food on site adequate.  Lots of good rides.,1
"I have to say, as an adult who had never been to anything Disney before, this was an amazing experience. I made sure to hit all the  classic  rides like the Tea Cups, Dumbo, and Small World. I had a blast, but I don't care for fast and scary rides at all, so the rest of my group enjoyed the Matterhorn. We made sure to get a Dole Whip Float, it was worth the $5 and the wait in line on a hot summer day. We had to laugh when we took the Jungle Cruise as it is just like the Wisconsin Ducks ride in Wisconsin Dells. Same snarky one liners from the tour guide, just exotic animals instead of the wildlife in Wisconsin. We enjoyed it though, like we were home for a few minutes on our trip.",1
"Who doesn't love Disneyland??? If you have kids, its a must to visit the park. Purchase the hoper so visit both parks to get the full experience. My daughter loves Disneyland. We always have fun. The rides are awesome and we enjoy the parades. We visit at least once a year. ",1
"Got offered a discount on entry. Is anyone in your party over 60. Ten years shy of that age, I took offence. I shouldn   t have. Terrific day our!",1
"We spent two days over Spring Break at Disneyland with our 4 year old (almost 5) son and 6 month old daughter, and had an absolute blast. My wife and I visited as a couple more than a decade ago, and the park is now even better than we remembered it, with lots of new rides, attractions, and entertainment options. One of the very best things about Disneyland is that they truly understand what it's like to travel with kids of different ages, so it's literally one of the few places in the world that caters so well to families as a whole. Our son, at 44 , was tall enough to ride almost everything except the most adventurous attractions, and lots of them (including marquee rides like Pirates of the Caribbean, Toy Story Mania, and so on) are gentle enough to ride with a baby in a carrier.We hauled our daughter in a front pack both days, and for a child of this size, it worked out so much better than worrying about a stroller. We had no issues taking her on many rides, and every attraction with a height restriction allowed us to baby swap   our family lined up together, and then my wife and I took turns accompanying our son (who got to ride twice!) while the other waited with baby at the exit. Absolutely brilliant, and together with Fastpass, we were amazed at how much we were able to see and do with both a child and an infant in tow. I have stood in the shadow of Everest, and watched the sun rise over the Taj Mahal, yet the memory of our little family piled onto a boat in  It's a Small World , with my son literally bouncing up and down, and my little girl staring at everything from her Baby Bjorn with mouth wide open, will be up there as one of my most enduring memories.This is truly a magical destination, and at least for our family, one of the happiest places on Earth. We'll be back soon for sure!",1
Loved it!  Recommendations.....  Studio tram tour  Motor stunt show  Hollywood tower hotel (not for little ones)   Toy story parachutes,1
yes spend the money as it will be returned with less wait time   ensure you do the lunchtime grand parade to miss the ques for the avo one. Then when the avo parade is on go to the most popular venues. Ensure you put you name down to cut the ribbon each morning with the characters   this is not promoted but I would love to have this honour.,1
"Great place, please do not hesitate in visiting Disney.  The shows, the rides and the food.  Everything it   s perfect",1
"I would like to clarify that DisneyLand is older than  Disney World . The Florida attractions are much faster, Much NEWER, and actually replicas of what is located in Calif. Disneyland is the original, don't be confused. It's annoying to read bad things about the happiest place on earth. I went there as a child and learned patience (standing in line for Small World), how to deal with dissapointment....when I wasn't tall enough to get on a ride. Disneyland isn't about cramming as much information and rides into a day to make you feel like you got your $$ worth. It's about spending time with your kids and self, having a great time eating expensive churros(you know you spend more money in Vegas) thinking about all of the possibilities of the imagination. Stop Complaining people. lots of folks don't have that luxury. It is the happiest place on earth and some people are just miserable.",1
"This is the second time that my family and I have visited Disneyland. We have visited Walt Disney World in Lake Buena Vista more times than I can count. Just like last time, this place is just not like Walt Disney World. The upkeep is lacking (e.g., paint missing from attractions), the employees are not as professional (e.g., a custodian talking to me about how someone was trying to cover up that they were smoking marijuana in the bathroom with perfume), and it just does not have the  feel  of Walt Disney World. This is a very good place to visit if you are in California, but Walt Disney World is definitely the place to visit if you want the true Disney experience.",1
"great place. though the food are a little expensive. if you go here, i recommend you to stay until the fireworks.",1
"The best thing about Disney? The ability to do all those things that you did as a child without someone wondering what's wrong with you. Why? Because everybody is doing exactly that. I absolutely loved the Star Wars simulation ride (the longest queue), The Pirates of the Caribbean Ride (through water) and of course the Indiana Jones Ride (good fun but quite short). The boat ride on the Mark Twain is also something that is definitely worth doing. You can easily spend an entire day.",1
Fab place   everything was amazing (apart from the queues   even they weren't too bad!). Kids loved it   we went just before Halloween and saw all the Halloween shows too. Loved it!!,1
Took my 3 children to disneyland last week. Had the most amazing time. My daughter has special needs and the care provided for her was phenomenal. I never dreamed she could visit such a place but disney made it possible. The staff were so helpful. Full stars all round.,1
"It was very great vising hk disneyland , we went their by metro , yes you have to walk a lot , dont forget to carry your umbrella it was very hot in september first week , out side eatables or selfie sticks are not allowed inside , they also provide locker too , eating inside is very expensive but you have no choice and food also is not good. All rides and shows was very awesome , its for adult also not for kids   because it is very good. One can cover only all shows and rides if you enter exact at 10 am there when it opens , you should leave your hotel at 8 am , and you can also prebook your tickets on their site and also can buy there too. You will need all one day , from 10 am to 8 am to cover all things , there was also a bigand very nice parade starts at 8 pm . Its a must do thing , awesome . First on time of booking you will feel that price of one ticket is expensive but after watching all shows you will feel its worth it more . ",1
"The excitement never ends and thats the reason why we were among the last few to get out after the closing time. The Sleeping Beauty palace is breathtaking, the shows,,,,Golden Mickeys, Its a Small World, Winnie the Pooh, and Lion King Festival were just great. The river cruise was fantastic. The souvenir shops and items were affordable. The parade of the Disney characters was amazing. Food was good. Fireworks display was not very fabulous however. Although we were not able to experience all the rides due to time constraint, the overall Disney experience was very satisfactory.",1
"Just loved it here. My kids are 14, 10 and 8 and still had a fantastic time. It's so much better than Disneyworld because it was less crowded and everything is so much more accessible! My feet weren't killing me and I did both Disneyland and Disney's California Adventure all in one day on a park hopper pass. Top notch Disney experience! Stay at the Grand Californian for easy access to the parks and extra magic hour!",1
"We were there Xmas and Boxing Day and was the best time.  So quiet in the morning, got nearly the whole park done by 2pm.  Did the same the next day  Night Light show was truly amazing",1
"Park has a great feel to it that never fails to make my family feel we are entering a magical kingdom. We made good use of fast pass and wore sensible shoes to queue. The Tarzan show was fun and the parades great. However, nothing can beat Disney New dreams, a show displayed on the Princess Castle with lazers, water fountains, fireworks etc...Best Disney display we have ever seen and even beats the American Disney which we have gone to twice. Get near to the castle though to see it for the full affect.Take your own food or book into the Plaza Gardens that offers an all you can eat buffet and soft drinks. Great selection of food at 27E for adults and 14E for kids. Is quite expensive but is the best option in the park as caters for all palettes and children, Book prior to going though as gets really busy.",1
"Really great day, recommend doing the film themed park first then this one, fireworks at 11:30, too late for us, but the park was kicking from 10am to 12 midnight...great value for money too",1
I would advise getting to the Magic Kingdom really early because by the afternoon it is usually now just too crowded.And we went the end of Aug. when most of the children were back in school. Was really disappointed we were not able to go on all the rides we had wanted to.,1
"Visited Disneyland for the first time for my sons birthday we traveled as a family of 4.8 year old and 4 year old.The park was absolutely spotless it   s amazing given the fact of how busy the park gets.Food prices are to be expected for a (Disney Park) food was ok but could improve. Drink prices are ridiculous, nearly    4 Euro for a bottle of water. The fact of having to wait around 50 60 mins for the children to meet one character is disgusting and tiring. The fact of waiting 80 90 mins for one ride that lasts 5 mins is absolutely disgusting and tiring. The was no magical feeling for the children, when you see a Disney character they would be running to the next show or to get changed, not even so much as a photo! The army around the park was also frightening for the children but also reassuring for us adults. I explained to the children it was for our safety because they   re are so many (Bad dangerous) people nowadays. The Disney illumination was the highlight of the holiday. (Absolutely Amazing) we watched this for the 4 nights we were there. (Spectacular) however I would recommend going to the front around 20:30 to get a bench or a good seat. Be prepared for allot of ignorant people pushing and shoving. My boy was sleeping in the pram one night where this inconsiderate (B****** Man) thought he could hang over the pram and kick the pram not on purpose but he soon got told (Politely of course ;)! Would I return ? Not really sure in all honesty. It would have to be cheap . ",1
Kids loved it. Just the place to unwing and have some god family time. Would love to be back but in better weather,1
"Our first Disneyland and there were rides for 10 and 12 year old. Entry took 50 minutes when arriving at 10, but straight through the second day at 4!",1
There are so many things to see and do around the park. The parades and shows are a must see but the park is generally extremely busy,1
"It has probably been 5 or 6 years since my last visit to Disneyland. My wife and I were season pass holders for several years back then. As ever, the quality of every little thing in the park is amazing. Their attention to detail is so impressive. We got there just after opening, at 10:00 and stayed till just before closing at 8. It was a beautiful day, so the park was a little crowded. Still, never more than a 30 minute wait for any ride, and we did them all. All the open rides, anyway. A little disappointed Pirates and Matterhorn were both closed. Of course that information is available on their website if I had bothered to check.Our trip was with my daughter, son in law, and granddaughters, overall a great day.",1
"For all the ages, avoid peek season June to August, its hot and lines can go to 1 hour of waiting. Best and Beautiful in Christmas...my favorite time to visit..",1
Everybody knows this is a wonderfully magical place for families and it is really not tacky at all. I hate theme parks but I love Disneyland.  There really us something special about being there with a small child.,1
Disneyland as adults without kids is the best. Both parks are amazing and not being on a child's schedule or pace means you can see and do more and really take advantage of everything.,1
"The little one loved it but then again she wasn't paying. Came here twenty years ago and lo and behold it's exactly the same apart from space mountain has change it's name to star wars, bizarre. C'mon disney give us something new. it's all a bit of racket this place, for instance a bottle of coke three euros fifty. A muffin five euros and you don't even get disney insignia on it. It's all about the kids tho and mine absolutely adored it. Surprisingly the adults there loved it as much of the kids, mickey ears and all.Would I go again? Yes. in twenty years if I'm still alive, hopefully they will have a new ride or two.",1
"I have not been to Disneyland for years but now blessed with grandchildren the opportunity was presented to  roll back the clock . This is a very special place despite the crowds and long line ups. It is a lifetime, bucket list  must see .",1
"We took our wee boy, who was just turning 2 to visit Mickey and friends, and unsurprisingly, he LOVED it. While it is much smaller than WDW in Florida, it was compact enough to have lots for him without loads of walking for us. Plus smaller park means smaller lines and less people, generally speaking. The fantasyland there was great, with lots of rides for him  small world, the other boat road (with a French name), dumbo, teacups, etc. the alice in wonderland labyrinth was a HUGE hit. Lots of safe, but fun, twists and turns and places to run to get out some energy. He enjoyed the train, buzz light year shooting ride, and the big paddle boat. The food was better than Florida (just there 8 months prior to this Paris trip) with a definite Parisian twist. The evening show on the castle was truly mesmerizing, and again, despite being exhausted, he stayed awake for the whole thing for 3 nights! It was easy to do stroller parking for each ride (again, not as big as Florida) and easy to find nice shaded spots while he napped or while we waited for the parade. Parade was rather meh in comparison to the Florida one. Short and sweet with no real wow factor. The big highlight was the frozen singalong, which we did twice. He loved it and kept his eyes glued to the stage. When we took his cousin the second time, he kept explaining to him what was going to happen and telling him where to look! Overall, I think we will be making long weekends to Disneyland Paris an annual treat! We first visited years ago and were sorely disappointed, but the major renovation is doing it lots of good!!!!",1
"Its huge , not enough to visit in one day. We did with 2 days pass ... all the scenes were amazing ... you were like in movies, fairytales, etc. At 8 pm, we have enjoyed lots with the character show on the street. Must Visit !!! ",1
No other word for it if you can't enjoy this I'm shocked.something for everyone makes you feel like you're a child again but the smile this place gave my daughter was priceless. The only negative is the lack of manners so many people have at parades and fireworks (have to be seen tobe believed) butt that isn't a criticism the park. You really need 2 days to see the place properly,1
"What more superlatives are there to add about Disneyland? The Magic Kingdom is magical; a living fantasy land where everything is near perfect. There are two parks both of which are incredible. The attention to detail of the designers is beyond equal. Every part of the parks is scenic; there are no sheds or modern buildings housing rides. Merchandising is everywhere but discreetly disguised as old fashioned shops,cafes, etc. Disneyland, and this is the original, is smaller than Walt Disney World in Florida but it still takes a day to do each park and doesn't lack anything. Disney characters wander around and there are lots of photo opportunities. A must do when in this part of the world. ",1
"Very busy but it was the 25th anniversary actual date, so what did we really expect. Trouble is that we tried to visit both parks in 1 day and this was both stressful and trying for all the family. Next time we will take a couple of days and do 1 park per day",1
"I went there with my whole family (18 people) in April. This is my 4th time there and it was still magical. We always went there only on the non peak day because the size of the park itself. We heard that during the Chinese holiday or some weekends the park was packed. As long as you go there on the non peak day, I think you will get the Magical experience as we do.",1
"The toilets were surprisingly dreadful in each one, but maybe they aer good the rest of the time. But the buffets were good and the restaurant clean, lots of choice",1
Not sure what else to say.  It's Disneyland.  Long lines but lots of fun.  Went for three days.  Seems like lots of rides kept brealing down.  Prirites did 3 times.,1
"My daughter and I visited Disneyland Paris yesterday. It was easy to get to on the metro. We bought tickets at the information centre just outside the gates. For the happiest place on earth there wasn   t many smiling faces. The attractions were great, the staff were friendly and because it was Disneyland it had a great vibe. The only thing that was dissappointing was that there was very few shaded spots and when you finally found one there was people there already. The queues for the rides was ridiculous, so I was glad I didn   t have any children with me, although I do inderstand this can   t be helped. Generally though we had a great, very long, day.",1
"As grandparents we take grandkids when they are between 8 and 9. We were last at Disneyland Spring of 2012 and back in Sept 2013 with another 2 grandkids. I remember going in the early 60's, therefore Disneyland is special to me.The lines can be long   that is why I never go between Memorial Day and Labor Day.I also use a service program that helps plan my day in the park. If you want to maximize your time on rides, instead of lines; search for Planning Software for Disneyland. Also, if you pay full price for admission it is because you haven't done your research well enough. There are discount tickets out there   research more...The park is always CLEAN. The cast members are trained well and are always cheerful. My one complaint is the cost of Parking, Drinks & Snacks. Oh well, it is still worth the memories made.",1
"Feb is the best month for disneyland.  Great weather no crowds!!!  The longest line we had to wait in was fastpasses for radiator springs racers, and it was only 10 minutes long!!!",1
"This is heaven, the best place on earth, my favorite place ever, it is really fantastic, we went there and spent all the day long, saw the parade and the night show, it is amazing, I think we should go there every time we visit Paris",1
Disenyland was great   the history and hidden gems make the trip worth it... but if you are a Disney World Magic Kingdom diehard... this will be disappointing if you don't prepare yourself. The entire place would fit in the parking lot at Magic Kingdom. But it's still fabulous.   Use the fastpass every chance you get  ride a few of the longer line rides first  for some reason Peter Pan always has a crazy line  check out some of the additional tours (but be prepared to shell out some cash),1
Went on the new Star Tours 3D   just as good as the first but with the added extra of 3D.Loved both and glad they added 3D.Will go again next time to Disneyland.Waiting for the new ride at Ca Adventure to open   this summer. Looks like fun.,1
"Hi we've just come back from France and our trip to Disney. We drove via EuroTunnel with Tesco VouchersStayed in a Gite in Champagne for a week   40mins drive to Disney.Ordered tickets via the french ticket agency FNAC   picked them up from a nearby Carrefour supermarket with no problems.Were concerned it would be busy with long queues as is school hols   but was totally fine, with rides first thing, get fast passes for rides later on and then shows in the afternoon, few more rides in the evening. We have a 5 year old, so the rides we went on were geared towards that age!Visited Disney Park on Tuesday, got there at 9am, parked in Disney Village car park   very easy and so close! had to exchange tickets for ones you swipe through the turnstiles, in park by 9:30am. Although official opening time is 10am   get to Disneyland Park early   they let you into the Main Street at 9:30am where the shops are already open and then cast members let you into each of the lands at 10am. By 10:30am we'd already been on It's a Small World (lovely) and Peter Pan ( Jerky, too dark to see any of the PEter Pan scenes), and were in the Labyrinth, then did Storybook Boats. Petit Train (good spot round there for meeting disney characters), got fast pass for Buzz Lasers, ate picnic lunch whilst watching Disney Express show, afternoon did shopping, Buzz Lasers, (Keel Boats were shut), Peter Pan Show, Pochontas Playground, then went to Disney Village for dinner in Rain Forest Cafe. Back into Disney Park for Parade, Mickey's Magic Show, Fantillusion and Fireworks!On Thursday   had 1 day 2 park tickets so we could do the Studios, but also go back to Disney in the evening. We arrived at the Studios   again easy to exchange tickets for swipe ones & much shorter queues to do that than at Disney Park. The Studios don't let people through until 10am, unlike Disneyland Park. But still worth getting there a little early to be one of the first in the queues   really gives a head start on rides! Got fast pass for Hollywood Hotel, Straight on Studio Tram Tour   fab, then Slinky Dog, hubby then went on Hollywood Hotel, met Mickey, got fast passes for Flying Carpets, Playhouse Disney Show, ate picnic lunch on bench, Flying Carpets, Moteur Show   fab, Cinemagic, Animagic, Stars n Cars Parade (good, much shorter than Disney Parade finishes with performance in the circle). We did avoid the Cars ride   75min wait for what was essentially a 2 min Bumper Cars ride!We ate dinner at MacDonald's in the Village (no vegy options & ran out of ice cream!), then back into Disney Park, Autopedia, shopping, explored Fort, Pirate Cove, Pirate Beach, Snow White (not great ride), Small World and then the Disney Train to take us back up to the end. Really surprised how much we managed to do at such a busy time of year!Disappointed with Peter Pan ride particularly, Snow White is not great. Also, some of the ride staff were not particularly welcoming seemed a little miserable!, although those in the shops and shows were fantastic. Only little gripes, but we did have a great time!",1
"loved everything, it was clean, fun and friendly,   Food within the park is pricy, go in spring the wait times are shorter",1
"I was here with my friends, and we went here early in the morning as we bought the 1 day Hopper park ticket to both parks. I can highly recommend this if you are visiting Disneyland without children as there are many attractions only for children. It was an great experience I loved the Splash Mountain, Space Mountain and Indiana Jones   very nice attractions!I can highly recommend to start early in the morning where you start with this park and when you gets hungry for lunch enter the other park, California adventure. In the California park we ate at the restaurant, Wine Country Trattoria which were really good. Remember to wear comfortable shoes as you gonna walk a lot.",1
"Hong Kong Disneyland is a lot of fun , a lot smaller than most but packed full of fun rides a jungle safari and a great boat ride through large caves with all the disney characters singing and performing, it reslly was an enjoyable day and the disney train ride there is pretty cool as well.",1
"Everyone at the park were amazing. Long queues but that was expected in August lol. Photopass is well worth the money as my graddaughters main priority was the meet and greets,we came home with 50 photos.The night time castle illuminations and fireworks were out of this world ! The parade is also a must see.We need a return visit to do what we missed lol.Don't forget your autograph book.",1
"Good theme park overall. Need 2 days to explore both theme parks though! The disney studios is worth visiting!  The city of paris is quite far from the Park. At least an hour away, which we didn't contend when we booked the hotel.",1
"Amazing, my daughters fell in love with the place, especially the castle! Be prepared for sore feet though!",1
"We have recently returned from a trip to Disneyland. We stayed for 6 nights at the Candy Cane Inn and had great time. The hotel was clean, the grounds were pretty, and the shuttle was wonderful! The air conditioner worked quietly. The continental breakfast was ample. We never got around to using the pool. The rooms did only have two chairs with the table. We had a standard room. Since it was just the two of us, we used the other bed for our luggage and misc. The shuttle drivers were a real plus! We were happy to be within walking distance, but have a shuttle to fall back on when our feet hurt...Since they have added California Adventure and Downtown Disney, it takes more walking than it used to! Use the fast pass system. We had great meals at the Jazz Kitchen for lunch and at Blue Bayou, also for lunch.",1
"This was my 5th return trip to Disneyland, and as always, the park continues to exceed my expectations with regards to cleanliness, crowd control, food quality and plain old magic! We went during the Halloween season, and attended the halloween party, to which you need to obtain separate tickets, and we had a BLAST! The trick or treat trails were a favorite among the group, and some of the attractions are done up for the Halloween season!",1
Just like the American park but very expensive for drinks. I had a wheel chair as I have a bad leg and I must admit that some people are very rude but it was nice to be able to go in the disabled access. On the last day my son has queued for the teacups ride just got on when they had to close the ride. It would have been nice to know what was happening,1
"Disney heroes and heroines live in fairytales that are, happily, never ending !  Amazing attractions are perfect !",1
i just want to say...very excellent..two thumbs for you.the staff very nice to kids..they smile always..my daughters really deep in love with mickey minie characters now..,1
I visited the park months ago and was very pleased with the result. The light show at the end was wonderful.,1
"My family and I visited Disneyland during the middle of November. We stayed within walking distance to the park which I definitely recommend doing. We had a 4 day pass and utilised this by visiting Disneyland the first day, California Park the seo nd day, and then went between both on the third and forth day going back on the rides we enjoyed the most. The MaxPass app was a savour in Disney. We used this for 3 days being there and managed to go on most of the rides including the larger ones with a maximum wait time of 30 minutes. This app was also convenient to be able to see wait times of rides and navigate through the park. The other great benefit of the MaxPass was the ability to download photos for free through the app. Our family got many professional photos and photos with the characters and downloaded these to our photos straight away. I would not visit Disney without the MaxPass app unless you are willing to wait 1 2hours for some rides. I would not recommend eating in the park (unless you book prior online for restaurants etc) as there is long wait times for eateries also and it is expensive in the park. Disneyland is such a magical place and for children it is beautiful. Be aware it is crowded and can be hard to get around at certain times of the day. ",1
"This was our second time and we thoroughly enjoyed it but as its half term it was extremely busy, ques for the rides were very long. They went down about 6pm or when the parades were on. The last parade at losing time was out of this world and worth waiting for and to top it off I got to meet jack sparrow!!",1
"Besides the facts of a bad weather the day we visited and the disorganized lines to go through security, the park is beautiful. It has the enchantment of Disney and it is a mix of the old children stories and the new ones made rides or attractions. Good food at prices more affordable than the parks in Orlando, considering the exchange from Euros to US Dollars. Small park but very nice. Very similar to Disneyland Hong Kong",1
"A great experience and worthwhile for a day visit.The place has great atmosphere and I love the different themed areas. Walking through the Star Wars themed areas; having a drink in a saloon; and walking through Mickey Mouses' house are among some of the pretty cool things to do.It is great to see the Disney characters come to life in the rides, performances, the parade, etc.It is worthwhile to go visit this park, but, naturally, many of the rides and shows are targeted toward families and children. Nevertheless, I thought it was great.Lining up was very annoying. Although they had 'skip the line' tickets, you still had some lining up to do and this took a fair bit of time. This is what probably put a dampener on the day.",1
"Absolutely loved the park. Hard to seperate a favourite between here and CAP, both different and great in their way; just go to both with a park hopper.Being from Australia, comparing Disney to Australian theme parks is like chalk and cheese. Will be back ASAP. Can't wait for star wars land.",1
"I was with my 2 little kids while visiting Disney Land during raining day unfortunately , we were upset that the Train of Disney railroad in Fantasyland to mainstreet was close on time at 6pm even RAINING !! it should be operating to send as many visitors as it could back to the main street in order to get home or get back to the main place for dinner. In fact, many people were wet without the alternate option but to walk all the way to Main Street even some without rain suit and umbrella ...",1
"We've been to Disneyland many times and it always impresses. The rides are great, the atmosphere wonderful. All in all a great day out. Food is pricey but you can get snacks from the shops outside of the park. Get there early to avoid queues and make use of the Fastpass ticket system for the popular rides.",1
"Can't seem to cut ourselves off ! Thought the kids would outgrow it. 26,23,14?????? Not yet!!!!!!!!  Guess we are gonna roll right into grandkids?!?",1
"My Niece named this park the best and the happiest place on earth. She just enjoyed every minute of our visit, even though she go there at least 3 or 4 times a year. Every time a family member visit them from overseas ,there's always a trip to Disneyland. Its my first time to visit, and its an absolute magical experience. We spent the whole day, walking around around and having so much fun. Its not enough for the day, we have to come again. The Fantasyland ridesis so good, its just unbelievable. We waited till the parade and the atmosphere is so euphoric,justwatching the world Disney characters is awesome.",1
"We purchased a 3 day park hopper pass thinking we would only need to use 2 days. However, when it got to the 3rd day, we were rushing to see all of the attractions and go on all of the rides after watching the magnificent fireworks for the 3rd time.Even though we were both adults over 25, (with no children) we found so many fun things to do and see, and wanted to try everything to relive our childhood.I would recommend that anyone who goes for the first time purchases at least a 3 day parkm hopper pass, as it allowsyou to swap between both parks throughout the 3 days. Since both parks are within a few metres of eash other, you can easily go back and forth between them.I would also suggest that you visit on at least one night of the weekend, so you can experience the fireworks in the park with the full music and light spectacular.",1
"I love HK Disneyland   yes it is not as big as the US ones and it doesn't have as many roller coasters, but it is getting there. Avoid going Sundays and Public Holidays as it is stupidly busy   any other time, it is cruisy   most that you will wait to get on a ride is 10mins.",1
Such a beautiful place with something for everyone to enjoy from the many characters walking around to the rides. One of the days we went it was raining so there were characters EVERYWHERE which was really good so it wasn't so bad. You definitely need at least 3 days there in order to see everything. Try and get in a little earlier in the day particularly if there's something you really want to see or do that you know will be busy to avoid waiting to long.,1
"I found this park better than the one at Florida and Hong Kong. It seemed easier to navigate and the equivalent rides were actually better ! More thrills !, and quicker lines. It was more expensive to eat here, but we expected the heart stopping prices.",1
"Visited Disneyland Paris for 4 days in September 2011. I absolutely loved it, there was so much to see and do. Rides were great and we were lucky that we visited I guess off peak as there wasnt bad queues and if there was a half hour queue we simply used a Fastpass. The park is clean, constantly seeing people sweep up. There are rides and attractions for all ages and all type of riders. The whole place is completely overpriced, charging    4 for a bottle of coke. We learnt after the 1st day to bring our own drinks in! They say they do not allow picnics in the parks and all bags do get searched upon entry but I saw plenty of people still taking snacks in to keep the cost down. We wanted to buy a couple of souvenier photos from the rides which we did, just be prepared to pay around    15 for one.......",1
"Once again I`m back from here as I have been going every year for 3 years. If I lived in London I`d be there weekly! I LOVE it.The park is CLEAN, BEAUTIFUL, ENCHANTING and has PLENTY of things to do! All the rides are fab especially Nemo but unfortunately this is the one ride that has queues lasting over an hour on peak seasons! but I didnt queue for more than 20 minutes long at any other ride and fastpass is there for busier days anyway! the parades were great but to be honest we only watched one on our last day because we were to busy!I am really sad and a little annoyed that there are no shows such as Tarzan and Lion King anymore its silly! however I actually did enjoy chilling and watching Mickey cartoons at the videopolis.The park is stunning at night whith all the lights and If you miss this then you have missed half the magic! The people moaning about the COSTS of food and drink here amongst other things should really do their homework before visiting this place! Paris in general is expensive so a main attraction within it is not going to be any cheaper! If you cant afford to spend 12 euro`s on just a hotdog then...DONT GO! I know the costs are atrocious but prepare for this way in advance! we took the half board premium option when staying over (this isnt Alton Towers so day trips I wouldnt reccommend unless you had good organizational skills) and saved hundreds!!",1
"Disney knows how to have fun! We were staying at the Davy Crockett Ranch, which work perfectly, we got entrance tickets as part of our stay in also meant parking was free  and we were allowed into the park earlier than the the crowds.From the moment we walked in, we loved it!! Its clean, friendly and has something for everyone. I havent been to Orlando  but i know it woud be bigger and better  however we had a great time. Some of the rides were fantastic  tower of terror was fab. I also LOVED stitch live, and my husband enjoyed the stunt show and The films special effects ride.i would commentent on the europeans queue jumping  yep its annoying, its as annoying when it happens at Alton Towers (it happens everywhere!!) But it really didint spoil the experience. The fire works and night parade... DO NOT MISS IT! brilliant, and bit of booing and hissing at the 'baddies' gives you some great photo opportunities.we really only ate in the park twice once for lunch  standard burger meal  with was average and then once for dinner at the roller resturant, whihc was expensive but was a nice restuarant and the service was good also.great place, will definately be returning",1
"This was our first time with the children as my husband and I had been there before they were born. The children had been begging to go for years and they were not disappointed!! They met tons of characters and yes the lines for most rides were long, but it was well worth it! Also, if you want a meet and greet with Anna and Elsa, be prepared to not only get into the park super early, but be fit because you will have to race to the spot where they give out tickets and line up to get them. They're very strict and won't let you in without one. Took me 3 days before I actually got the tickets. Thank goodness because my daughters would not have been very happy if we missed out for the 4th time. Overall, amazing!!! Can't wait to go back. 5 day hopper pass the best option.",1
"Must see:Frozen showIt's a small world Meet Mickey Mouse Buzz light year laser blastFire works showTips:Must get stroller if you have kids Get map and events times then plan plan plan what you want to save time and not feel lostA lot of walking so be comfyEverything are queuing so be patient, check waiting time3 days are enough to see most things Buy tickets from your hotel to avoid queue and save money Hotels have shuttle bus from and to every 10 15 minBuy water from supermarkets, much cheaper than hotel (1.5 vs 2.8   )Make sure weather is not rainy before planning your visit Dining is better and cheaper outside the parks beside disney store than inside",1
Just what the Doctor ordered for fun.... If you like fun parks is there really any better??,1
"For full 1 day,it was like revisiting your childhood.To add icing on the cake,my kids were a part of this.Extremely nice place & a must do in your travel itinerary in case you are planning Hong Kong travel.Expect the unexpected here, rides,food,castles,characters.. You name it...it's right there.It's a place,you must try...not alone..kids make it even more memorable. Day end parade was out of this world..great place to carry memories forever",1
"Great day, due to weather, no lines!  It was our first time returning to the park in twelve years.  So much has changed.",1
"What an amazing place, it was great to see the streets where Walt Disney had walked and ride the attractions he worked on.It was magical. We arrived before opening and the gates opened at 740 giving us time to walk to the rope drop area because of this we managed to ride 5 rides before our 9am breakfast.We visit the Plaza in which was amazing.We stayed in park until 7pm using fast pass and trying to avoid the crowds. Disneyland has to be experienced if you are a Disney fan even if it   s just for the Disney history.",1
A spectacular parade after an evening of fun.  Everyone in costumes.  Many as Mickey & Minnie.  Lovely people and staff.,1
"I can't help but go back, time and time again! And each time, I see something I missed the last time. Everyone told me I wouldn't enjoy this park as much because we have gone to WDW. I love it just the same! Park Hopper is a must at the Disneyland resort! The two parks are only a few steps away from each other unlike WDW, no transportation needed! I love how everything is condensed into 2 Parks as opposed to 4 at WDW. The rides are similar to Magic Kingdom with a few different ones thrown into the mix, such as the Matterhorn and Nemo's Submarine Voyage, just to name a few. Star Wars has also taken over Tomorrow land, so if you're a fan, you'd absolutely love it. The fireworks and parades are nothing short of amazing! Sigh, writing this review makes me want to book a flight as soon as I am done. ",1
"Like most of our trips, it was a magical time. There was a hitch in that there was a possible bomb threat so we all had to evacuate the park and it didn't re open for another 3 hours. That put a damper on part of our sta. Turned out it was a rolled up not in a tree that was put there for a friend to find. the park however did compensate by staying open another hour past the time the normaly close and they added an extra show for all of the shows schedualed for that night. Over all it was a good stay, I look forward to the next one!",1
"The place suits the young and young at heart. It offers exciting activities like rides, shows, and other fun activities for all ages.Food had options, but most were pricey. We spent a fortune on food and beverages.We were hesitant to go there at first because of the rainy weather prediction. Fortunately, it didn't rain and was actually very hot. Best to bring an umbrella during visit for protection against the sun or rain. I just don't think you'l be able to explore all the rides offered during the rainy season.",1
I love Disney! My kids love Disney so this was perfect we absolutely loved every minute. The firework display at 10pm was amazing! Worth staying up for!,1
"We visited December 2015, me, my wife and 20 month year old son. We have already visited Disney in Orlando a few times with my older children and had heard that compared to the Florida experience, Euro disney can be a disappointment. Yes of course the Florida collection of parks has more to offer but we absolutely loved our time here. Top tip would be make use of your extra magic hours if staying on the resort as the place does get very busy and head for attractions you have noted long waiting times from previous days. There are plenty of character opportunities and again get there early as they can be very popular, especially the Mickey Mouse encounter, also featuring father Christmas at the far end of the park and the Princess encounter. But do persevere as my little one fell in love with Mickey and we have some excellent photos to treasure. On the subject of photos, if your going to be there for a few days do get the PhotoPass, but probably not worth it if there just for the day.At the entrance of the park the hotel has two restaurants, we had a meal at the Inventions Buffet, yes a little on the pricey side said but well worth it and the food selection was amazing.The parades as you would expect were amazing, don't get to worried about setting up too early, we witnessed people getting a place sometimes over an hour before they start, we didn't and just found a place when they actually began, its easily done and the parade route covers such a wide area.The Frozen stage show was great as was the night fireworks with Olaf on the castle...tough to keep the little one up for though.All the rides were of a high quality although if I had to be a little critical the Buzz Lightyear ride felt like it had seen better days and perhaps could do with a overhaul.Even the guide was excellent and must rides if you too have a little one would be Small, Small World and basically all the ride along family rides. We even tried the Pirates of the Caribbean which does feature a little drop but he loved it.A great holiday and we will certainly return.",1
"Having just been to Disney World in Kissimmee last year, we were a little spoiled (since it was bigger). However, it was still a magical experience for us all. The parade was great and the character breakfast at the Plaza Inn was definitely worth it for the photos and signatures my 5 year old collected.",1
"We have just returned from an amazing three days at Disneyland, Paris. It is the most amazing place, thousands and thousands of people which makes the place even more incredible because they handle the masses remarkably well. Do not go if you can't be doing with standing in a queue, as you will queue for everything, from checking in at your hotel to meeting a character to getting a coffee in the park, but it sort of doesn't matter cos everyone is doing it!We stayed in the Hotel Cheyenne which is walking distance from the Park along the canal and lake. If you walk to and from the park you will miss out the first big queue of the day which is the bag check before you even enter either of the parks. We had fantastic weather which really helped, but my husband and I felt that two days was plenty for us, but the kids would have stayed for ever I think. It is expensive, but we took our own lunch and masses of snacks and drinks in our rucksacks to keep the kids going all day. Take plasters for blisters, you will walk miles and miles but for all the aches and pains it is worth all of it!!",1
"We are big time Disneyland fans! Our families favorite rides are various from Space Mountain to Pirates of the Carribean, It's a Small World to Splash Mountain. The only thing that would make our days on the property better would be fewer crowds. The park seems to be busier at night, so anytime we go, we make sure to be there at opening and then leave around dinner time. We all had a great time and can't wait to start planning another trip!",1
"The magic of Disney did not disappoint. Visited the week before Christmas (unfortunately two overcast days with light rain). Lots to see and do. Food was reasonably priced (to be expected)   noting there was no restrictions on bringing your own food into the park?   so second day we packed some small snacks to eat on the run   in line. The rides were great and enjoyed by my 5yo daughter. Lines were fairly long (most were  30minutes) but to be expected. Service was generally excellent, with the exception of one chap who took did the typical    eye rolling    to me being an    English speaker   . Disappointing that a few people around the park think it   s ok to smoke also. All in all, completely fabulous! ",1
"We visited Disneyland for the first time this July, and we had a great time. It was extremely hot, so I recommend bringing lots of sunscreen and packing your own water if you can (water is around $3.99 a bottle). SPOILER alert: I know people say you can't compare Disneyland to Disney World, but I am going to do that anyway. So, if you've never been to Disney World, you may not want to read further. And, since I visited Disney World (twice now) before Disneyland, my review may be somewhat biased...but, it is my opinion after all....Rides: If you like the Magic Kingdom in Disney World, then Disneyland is the place for you! Most of the rides in Magic Kingdom are what makes up Disneyland. I found them to be for the most part the same, but I do have a few slight differences.Space Mountain: Disneyland is better because there are more people per car (about 6) and you sit side by side as opposed to in front of one another. It also seems more intense than the DW version, especially since they seemed to have re done it with Star Wars style music, dubbing it  Hyperspace mountain . Splash Mountain: DW is better. There is a bigger drop from the top, the  storyline  is more consistent and you sit side by side with family members as opposed to front to back at Disneyland. It also seems longer than the Disneyland version.Haunted Mansion: Disneyland is better   spookier. It has more  haunted figures    mannequins and seems longer than the DW version.Pirates of the Caribbean: Disneyland is better. It has more  figures  and more of a storyline (less Hollywood movie    more original stuff) than the DW version.Small world   Disneyland is better. I heard more foreign languages spoken at this version than at the one in DW. It is also nicely air conditioned, so not bad. Castle    Disneyland has a castle? It seems more like a mini castle after seeing what is at DW. Indiana Jones   This ride doesn't exist at DW, but the closest thing I can think of is the  Dinosaur  ride at Animal Kingdom. I have to say that I was disappointed in the theatrics of this ride and expected more from it than what it delivered. After going on Dinosaur at AK, this ride pales in comparison.Matterhorn   Another ride that doesn't exist at DW, and I guess you could say that Everest at AK was inspired by this ride, but, really? Another disappointment. I thought it would have a nice drop or something, but other than some twists and turns, this ride was pretty uneventful and not worth the 25  minutes we waited to ride it.Other: Walking distances are definitely shorter in Disneyland than the Magic Kingdom. It took less time to get from one  land area  to another. However, the lines seemed MUCH longer. I don't know why, but it seemed there was just no shade at any of the ride lines at Disneyland, where most rides at DW are at least either shaded or indoors. I also felt that the queuing system in Disneyland is not well marked. Because the lines are so long, they rope off sections of pavement with seemingly  generic  rope and you really have no idea (short of asking people waiting in the line) what the line is for. I also feel like the system for displaying FastPass return times needs to be a little more well marked, as the fastpass distribution centers weren't exactly close to where the main line for the attraction begins ends. While I completely understand why Disneyland uses the  older  FastPass system (no RFID bracelet like DW where you make reservations ahead of time), it seems like there has to be a better way. It was definitely a hassle to get FastPasses, and you had to be careful about how you get your FP, because the more popular rides (Splash  Space Mountain   Indiana Jones) the FP times are  eaten up  so quickly that by the time you're wanting to get another FP for those attractions, the next available FP time will likely be in the evening if you're lucky. So, my recommendation is to try to do those rides as soon as the park opens and then try to get a FP for later in the day if you want to re ride (no later than 1 p.m. or your return time will be really late). Food: Seems outrageously expensive in both DW and Disneyland. At least at Disneyland, you are close enough to the  outside world  that you could leave (potentially) and get something off property and go back in without wasting serious amounts of time, versus DW where there isn't anything remotely close to the park entrances, so you pay for it (literally). Park Hopping also seems like it would be easier at Disneyland. Even though we didn't have a PH ticket, the entrance to California Adventure was literally about 200 300 ft. away (tops) from the Disneyland entrance, so it would be more feasible to Park Hop if that's what you wanted to do. Although, I wouldn't recommend it because the lines would probably be atrocious because if Disneyland has  Early Morning Magic Hours , California Adventure has a  regular schedule  and vice versa...so either way, by the time you  hop , the lines would probably be big and it wouldn't be worth your time   money.All in all, we enjoyed our time at Disneyland and I am glad we went...but I personally enjoy going to DW in Florida much better.",1
"Visiting Disneyland was the first activity listed for our trip to Hong Kong. Arrived early and enjoyed Space Mountain and the Grizzly Runaway Mine Cars almost to ourselves, although it was New Years Eve. Went on the mine car ride twice without having to wait. Made our way through the different worlds and enjoyed a number of rides with short wait times. We saw a little of the lunchtime parade, but took advantage of the fact that food outlets were almost empty and grabbed lunch.Kids were exhausted by 3pm, ride waits were now in excess of 30 minutes, so decided to go back to our accommodation. MTR (public transport authority) has a dedicated train station with regular services, and worked out an easy way to travel there.Plenty of choices in regards to food options and prices were reasonable.All in all, a good day out enjoyed by kids and parents alike.",1
"I first visited Disneyland when the orange trees were being removed and the castle was being built. That was a long time ago and I have visited the park at least once a year ever since. Though it always changes with new attractions   some good and some removed   good bye flying saucers, what a sad day that was. Since its opening I have gone to Disneyland in Florida and Paris, but it is always fun to return to the first park that sat the standard for all the clones.",1
"We saw the parade in the afternoon (3:00 pm) and at night (7:30 pm), as well as the fireworks (8:30 pm). It was a sight to watch!! Once in a lifetime experience. The parade at night was so much more beautiful because of the lighting! The rides were good and my daughters had a ball getting their pictures clicked with their favourite characters (Snowhite, Cinderella, Rapunzel, Sleeping Beauty etc) in flesh and blood!!! ",1
"This is like many other Disney parks: crowded during school holidays, offering moments of fun after long waits in line. We bought tickets from our country of residence (offering a better price than on site), but then spent over an hour in line on arrival to exchange the printed vouchers for tickets. Entrance lines (huge crowds) weren't well marked   the original crowds are to get through security (people with bags must be checked   others walk on in)   the only not well marked thing I've found in many visits. Be sure to avail yourself of the fast track option (swipe your tickets at popular rides to come back at a specific time and have a shorter wait   only one available at a time per ticket). Taking your own lunch (especially if it is a multiple meal visit) is advised, as park lunch food is mediocre at best, the restaurants are packed, and it's relatively expensive. For dinner, we advise making reservations in advance (especially if a large family). The Studio side is about making movies, so even things like the car show were a lot of talk an prep to show how things are done (interesting to adults and possibly older kids, but not for small ones). It was a family experience, but not one I'd repeat regularly!",1
"I just love the atmosphere and the parades, the rides are incidental to me which is just as well as they kept breaking down. When you do get on them they are pretty good, although I would suggest get fast passes for everything you can.",1
We enjoyed seeing the park dressed up for christmas!!! The fireworks were so cool and the snow was a great extra touch...It's been 10 years since are last visit so much to see and do!!!,1
"Happy place for kids and kids at heart. Me and my son enjoyed the disneyland park. Though the time when we visited there, the castle is under renovation.      But otherwise the whole experience was memorable.",1
"Kids enjoyed it.  Hot, expensive and crowded.  Kids' favorites were Splash Mountain, Pirates of the Caribbean and Haunted Mansion.",1
"Disneyland in California shows no signs of aging. The park is kept immaculately clean and all of the staff have a ready smile and are eager to help you in any way possible. The park is much smaller than Disney World in Orlando and can sometimes feel very crowded, especially in Adventure Land. Food is good, pricey but all of the portions are very large and easily shareable.there are also dining options at California Adventure and Downtown Disney, as well as, in the immediate area just off property. Just remember to get your hand stamped for re entry into the park.One of my favorite rides is still the Jungle Cruise. Having ridden many times, we recently had the pleasure of riding with Captain Eddie, a young man from Illinois. Although I new most of the jokes, I have not laughed that hard in a long time. His delivery was so dead pan and right on target that the entire script felt fresh and new. He kept the entire boat engaged and made us feel like we were all his closest friends. Be sure to ask for his boat and enjoy the ride.",1
"The happiest place on earth never disappoints. I have been several times over the years and the park is always incredibly well kept and the customer service is always excellent. It's Disneyland, so don't be surprised if there are long, crowded lines. If you can't deal with an excess amount of people this isn't the place for you. Most bad reviews are from clueless people who don't understand what a trip to Disney entails. There are slower times that can be found by searching the Internet for crowd charts. At some slower times I find it almost too slow, so for those who hate crowds it should be fine as long as you plan around the crowds. Can't wait for Star Wars land!",1
"Disneyland Paris was amazing. Brought my daughter and her grandmother, and both loved it as much as me.The staff were friendly within the attraction, but outside of it (Paris) found the natives very offhand. The one thing that lets Disney down is the VERY poor quality of food.",1
"If you have an eticket, please go to the vending machines on the entrance of Disneyland Park itself before you go to the Movies Park, otherwise you'll be sent to them and you have to redo the waiting line. Take fast passes as much as you can to reduce the waiting lines. Few people are doing them so this could be an extra plus. Eating in the Village is very expensive but less waiting lines than in both parks. Eating after 14h or before noon could help as well. Attractions are possible to do untill half an hour of closing time. Great gathering on main road for Disney dreams. Stick till the end cause it's wonderful. Afterwards, don't take the main road to the exit but one of the two galleries next to it. ",1
"At Disney, for Teens and above you may expect phony, little kidish things at Disney parks these days, but that is not the case. There is an experience for everyone, things 4 everyone to do and so much variety. The only problem (why I gave it a 4 instead of 5) is that it's so great, so many people want to do it that the long annoying lines sometimes can ruin your plans 4 certain attractions, but Disney has met that with FASTPASS. With a FASTPASS u can enter a shorter, more convenient line after waiting for your certain FASTPASS time. They are very helpful 4 rides with very long rides.",1
"I was privately a bit worried about doing Disneyland for 2 days at the end of our 2 week US trip. I   m not keen on theme parks and we were dreading the queues for the rides and crowds trying to get food. Then we saw a recommendation for a book called the    Unofficial Guide to Disneyland   , which has incredible detail about every aspect of the park, and includes various length    touring plans    which you can use   adapt for your own party. Having read the book, we then started to think that we would have to plan it like a military operation for our time there to be a success. So we arrived with trepidation, armed with a plan, plenty of water and 2 very excited children... and had the most amazing and brilliant two days! I was incredibly impressed with the attention to detail everywhere in the park, the friendly helpful cast members, the smiles, the colours, the parades, the fireworks, the rides, the characters   everything! Getting there early makes a huge difference     we used Fastpasses wherever we could and went on the most popular rides before 10.30am. Note that you don   t have to go back during the hour printed on the Fastpass   you just have to make sure you are there after the start time. In fact we were allowed to get on one ride 10 minutes before our Fastpasses started. The longest we waited was 35 minutes for Buzz Lightyear   apart from that one we only waited 15 minutes at most. We also used the    child swap    when our daughter was too nervous to ride which worked really well.Food was OK and not as expensive as I had thought it would be     much better value than SeaWorld in San Diego     we ate in the caf   in Tomorrowland as the queues seemed not too long and there were pastas, pizzas and salads which the pleased the adults and the kids. We had fabulous ice creams on Main Street     there was a big queue but it seemed to move at a good pace so we didn   t wait too long. We got a spot in the shade about 30 minutes before the afternoon parade     arrive any later and you   ll be searching for a shady spot. Quite by chance we were sitting at the point where they stop and dance   the dancers encouraged all the children to come out and dance with them too. I did some autograph hunting with my daughter and was very surprised that we managed 21 autographs in 2 days! We didn   t do the princesses (seemed to involve a very long wait), but concentrated first on Toontown where we saw Mickey & Minnie in their houses, and Pluto. I asked a cast member where we could see Donald (my favourite) and she pointed us towards Town Square (at the entrance), adding that he might be there around 10am. So off we went     and he appeared on schedule, along with 15 other characters, one after the other. We spent about half an hour hopping from one queue to another, having a great time! The rides are varied and fun, beautifully made, and loading and unloading is in the whole extremely well organised, ensuring that they get as many people through as possible. I loved the Tiki Room     a very unusual and quirky show with animatronic birds with various different accents     and Pirates of the Caribbean was very impressive. All in all it is a totally magical place. I was a bit wary about the whole Disney experience, thinking it would be sickly sweet and over the top, but it is just fantastic!",1
"Me and my husband are big disney fans and have been to dlrp 3 times as a couple and this our first time as a family with our 21 month old son .Good points , the rides are as good now as they was when we first came to dlrp we dont mind the ques as you expect it, the new ratatouille ride was well worth the hours wait The charcters are brilliant our son was buzzing after meeting his fav charcters The dreams night time show is what disney does best absoultly fantastic we only saw it every night of our holiday Bad points . We stopped at the hotel cheyanne a westeren themed hotel , when we got we had an hours wait to check in .The room was very dark and dated , there was electric sockets that were loose so when you pull a plug out they moved . The carpets were very dirty , the corridor looked like it had never seen a vaccum cleaner in a long time .The staff atbthe hotel dident seem to know what they were doing it took nearly half an hour and three members of staff to find our sons picture of him with goofy.Now for the parks .We always make a point of gettin thepark map to find out when the parades are on and where the characters are only to find this time they have squezzed the two parks maps onto one with no info about parades , shows or charcters so i went into the city hall to ask only to be given the same map and to be told what i alredy knew .We found the staff very unethsiastic about where they are working and what they are doing . Our son is a people person and will wave and say hi to any one so when we got on a ride with him and him got ignored by a member of staff he was very dissapointed The park was busy which you do expect , but what you dont expect is foe there to be so many things to be closed , yes we know they have to do maintance on rides which we knew about before we went but we dident expect for there to be so many resturants to be closed which meant that when we found one that was open the ques was bigger that normal and the prices to have gone up so much ill definatly be doing a packed lunch next time The thing what really has annoyyed me and my hubbie is that people were walking around the park smoking everywhere we looked someone was lighting up or puffing on a cancer stick , we regularly had smoked blown in our faces or had to walk though clouds of smoke which is horrible for an asmatic and for our 21 month old so.Also the translation for none french speaking visitors was very poor .We had seen the parade before , so we told our son all about it only to find out that about 3 or 4 of the parade floats have been removed fron the show which made it shorter . We do hope that it changes for the better as its our fav place to go on holiday and we hope to have many more magical disney holidays with our son .",1
Disney is always ready to go the extra mile when looking for any item you may be looking for and even the other guests were polite and considerent,1
"After years of nagging I finally agreed to take my now teenage daughter to Disneyland, but in order to avoid the hefty financial burden of a USA trip, we went to Disneyland Paris. We stayed in Paris so we could go sightseeing one day (fantastic day out!) and Disneyland on the second day of our weekend trip. The train out to Disneyland was not the most pleasant of journeys as the train and stations are fairly dingy and the ticket machine was a bit challenging at first, but fairly cheap and easy to navigate. I have always avoided the intense marketing of all things 'Disney' where possible so I was amazed to find myself instantly in love with the place! Entering the park and seeing 'Main Street USA' looking so pretty and the impressive castle ahead   well, it was a 'WOW!' moment. My daughter had planned our route through the twin parks so off we went (handy app available for android phones!). The rides had the queue times posted and we didn't wait nearly as long as advertised at any of the rides (we didn't use the advance booking system) and found that queuing was part of the fun (lots to take in while waiting). The rides were amazing, even for someone who has a real fear of rollercoasters. The food wasn't as bad or as expensive as I'd anticipated but we really didn't eat much during our tour (you don't want a full stomach if you're being flung around at high speed). For me, the Star Wars simulator ride (where we effectively helped to blow up the Death Star!) and the Armageddon attraction (although without Bruce Willis in a vest!) were highlights. The Pirates of the Caribbean attraction was a real unexpected surprise   a huge and impressive set. There was plenty to keep visitors of all ages happy but I think by the end of the very long day we had done it all so I was pleased I hadn't booked to stay longer, although if you have little ones with you then staying on site makes sense. The only sour note is that smoking isn't banned in the park so designated smoking areas would be a pleasant addition (but this is France, so unlikely to happen unfortunately). The cherry on the cake was the parade which started up just as we were about to leave, so we stayed a little longer out of curiosity and I am so glad we did. Clearly this is what Disney does best   capturing the imagination and hearts of everyone who watched huge floats with all the favourite characters and a huge cast of extras singing and dancing their way along Main Street. A fantastic spectacle not to be missed. If, by the end of your visit to Disneyland, you haven't been moved then you have no imagination and soul!",1
"Great time with our 4 kids.  A quick tip is that Toon Town open at 11 (not regular park hours) and closes before fireworks, so make sure you do it early.",1
This is a place everyone deserves to go at least once in his life time . Here as you enter you forget all ages as rides and attractions brings you back to childhood. There are rides for every type of person and all sort of adventure . Restaurants and toilets cover all corners of the park and are well maintained .ThanksFamily TantiMalta ,1
"A truly wonderful day, lots of laughs, smiles, excitement and our eyes and ears were constantly happy. The food at the park is overpriced but then again, that's every theme park. Can't wait to take my unborn children there. Loved the Pirates Of The Caribbean boat ride. ",1
enjoyed this immensely but found it very epensive for food,1
"We had a wonderful experience for our first Disneyland visit. It was Chinese New Year when we were there, but we saw heaps. The Grand Parade was out of this world and catered for young and old. We took the train ride which gives you an overview of pretty much everything.",1
What must I say? A youth dream came true. It is a suitable experience for young and old. A must when you are in California.,1
"A very beautiful park. Those who regularly travel to Disney parks will find some things that definitely feel familiar. (certain attractions, like Peter Pan, Dumbo, Snow White). Other things are different but very nice. (Pirates of the Caribbean, the Haunted Mansion, etc). The staff at the park are all very nice and there are lovely shops with which to shop for souvenirs. The only caveat I have is to check beforehand which restaurants wil be open when you visit. There are times days when they are not all open. This is not a terrible thing but just something to be aware of if say you have family members with diabetes or other conditions that might require them to get a hold of something to eat or drink in a hurry.",1
Disneyland Paris is a must visit place in the outskirts of Paris. It will take the whole day to visit it and experience most of it.,1
"Amazing day in Disneyland. Came with an elder on a wheelchair, and disney staff is always on hand to help and provide a safe passage and special queue for us. Most rides are senior and child friendly.",1
"We took our two year old here for her birthday and she had a great time taking photos with all of the Disney characters. Be sure to pack sunscreen because they don't sell it at the park. As can be expected, food and trinkets cost a fortune so save up some money before visiting. There is a luggage check in to the left of the ticket sales (60HKD item). The food inside is not that great, but they do offer many options. The parade begins around 4pm and will slow your movement out of the park if you try to leave.",1
"We went in Hong Kong Disneyland last December 2016 and all I can say is ... We really had fun! We took pictures with Mickey Mouse, Mini Mouse, Goofy and Donald Duck. We rode some amusements and my fave was the  Hair Raiser  My kids loves it and we are planning to come over again this year for holidays.",1
"plenty of rides, big and small to entertain all, lots of themes to see and look around, could spend a good few hours to a day, looking just at the themes and getting pictures around the whole area, really fun, a great place to visit!",1
Had a great time and the shows were really neat. The rides are fun and enjoyed them a lot. I've been to Disneyland in Anaheim and this is just as good.,1
"Everything about this park is magical!  Everywhere you go you find yourself in an idealized yesterday, tomorrw, and or fantasy.  I went justwith my husband, no kids, and we had so much fun!!",1
Great place for young and old alike.  Queuing can be a nightmare on busy days and popular rides.  Try to fast track as much as you can.  Lots of souvenir shops and food outlets.  The restaurant in the Pirates of the Caribbean ride is awesome.,1
"Love Disneyparis, the place is magical. Enjoyed the shows and the parade! We had a little rain however that didn't stop the fun.We ate at innovations twice where we met mickey, tigger, Pluto, eeyore, chip, smee, captain hook, we had an ice cream birthday cake for my son's birthday and eeyore come out with the staff when they played happy birthday. Innovations buffet was delicious.We did character breakfast, where we met Mickey, Pluto, daisy, tigger, piglet and eeyore, breakfast food was also good, just didn't like their sausages.We watched various shows in both parks, people were sitting down getting for the parade 2 hours prior which we didn't do however it was very busy.Mickey magic show was excellent this was in WE.We queued for various other characters, Buzz, goofy, the genie, Jessie, chip & Dale, Donald, to name a few and finally found Woody on our last day Buffalo Bills was a great show and dinner!Illumations was great however we did leave at 22.10 to avoid delays getting out the park.We had a wonderful time and really enjoyed the magical experience ",1
"Nobody does theme parks better than Disney. My only complaint is that it's gotten very expensive. A two day park hopper pass for my wife and I was $470! And once you get inside, everything you might buy (food, clothes, souvenirs) is more than retail. It's still great fun, but better plan on spending a bunch.",1
"I had been there twice with my  grandson, I will never give up as my grandsons will never ! good to visit in winter as the weather is cold and can have a lot of fun",1
"My wife and I spent our anniversary last September at Disneyland in California. Wanted to compare Disneyland HK while visiting there in March.HK is a bit smaller in size, but still large enough to take a full day to see. Some rides and attractions are in California that aren't in HK, and vice versa.One of our favorites that is unique to HK was the Mystic Manor. Kind of like the California park's Haunted Mansion, with lots of animatronics, holographic projections and Disney characters that we have never experienced before.It was raining most of the Thursday we chose to visit. Still lots of people, but VERY SHORT lines into all attractions.Our trip to Hong Kong was for eleven days. We ate VERY WELL, but truth be told, we had some of the best Cantonese food during our entire trip in the park at the Plaza Inn off Main Street!Even if you don't get to Disneyland HK, you should take the special one stop metro that services it, as the trains have Mickey Mouse shaped windows and subway straps, and blue velvet couch style seating, with brass sculptured Disney characters in the cars.A must for all kids, young and old!",1
Despite what the majority of the travellers here says   I liked the resort more than the Ocean Park. You have to try the rollercoaster in the Grizzly Gulch!!! Awesome.,1
"So impressed with everything in Disneyland. Every ride, building, pathway, garden is immaculately maintained. Every staff member always has a smile to give and are so polite and friendly and helpful. The characters are amazing, and made us all feel so special. As expected, there were crowds and long waits for every ride and attraction, but I found most people were understanding and patient with the time it took. Love our photopass we got, and would definitely recommend it, we have close to 1000 photos that look fantastic and will be treasured as precious memories of our trip. The fast passes are definitely worth taking the time to collect, as they really knock off the waiting time for rides by substantial amounts. I can't wait to visit again",1
We visit at the lower peak season therefore we manage to get on all the rides almost without queuing.Also we manage to take pictures to lots of characters as well. One thing is to ensure you stay till the end for the fireworks as you can't have a complete trip without watching the fireworks display at the sleeping beauty castle ,1
When in Southern California you must go to Disneyland!! If you are from out of town be sure to stay at The Disneyland Hotel. They just remodeled the resort and the pool is great for kids!! If you stay at any of the Disney resorts you can get into the park an hour before all the other guests. The Mexican restaurant Tortilla Jo's in Down Town Disney is really good too!,1
I think the Disney park is beautiful especially at night with everything lit up. We visited in March and the waiting times for the rides weren't that bad. The Disney Dreams show was amazing and would love to see it again. The staff were also very friendly and helpful. My favourite ride is the Peter Pan ride and I love the Christmas shop located in Sleeping Beauty's castle. The downside is the food is very overpriced and I found it very overcrowded when watching the parade so it was hard to enjoy and I really wanted to see it.,1
"We were in Anaheim for a Convention, so we took advantage and spent a day at Disneyland. We had never been and after spending time at Disney World, we wanted to experience the original.It is a beautiful park. The Cast Members are very friendly and helpful and as you expect from Disney, everything is clean and maintained. It was very hot while we were there, but there is plentiful areas of shade and stores to go into to cool off. The rides were wonderful and it was nice to be able to know you were on some of the original first rides.It was very busy, so most of the lines were pretty long. We were able to ride pretty much everything we wanted, with about 20 30 minute waits. We never got to ride the one ride we wanted to try as it was always over a 2 hour wait but with only one day there, we couldn't spend all day in line.This is not a negative, but if you go into this one with the same expectations of excitement you feel at Disney World, you will be disappointed. There is a different vibe at Disneyland. It's about nostalgia and history, whereas Disney World you feel totally submerged in Disney. I was not disappointed as I felt like you could feel the spirit of Walt Disney here and imagine what it was like to dream up this world. The fireworks show is incredible, and I actually enjoyed it here more than the one at Disney World. The addition of a flying Tinkerbelle and Dumbo really made it special. It has the same areas as DW, like Frontier Land, Fantasyland, Adventure Land, and Tomorrow Land with many of the same rides. I did find the Pirates of the Caribbean and It's a Small World to be much better here. They are longer and different.So what is the bottom line of my review? If you are going to be in California, I would definitely say it's worth visiting. If you have the option of either going to Disneyland or Disney World, I would go to Disney World. There is more parks, more things to do there and just a more exciting feeling. But, if I was going back to California, I would definitely go again.",1
"It is hard to describe why as an adult I enjoy seeing someone dressed up as a cartoon character but believe me, there is something magical in it. I recommend visit to the park for all adults and children, but avoid busy times. Very relaxing. Mid October was a good time. Hardly any queues. Only downside was a big rat and this was not Mickey but a real live one. It came out to see people on broad day light and was not afraid at all. Disgusting. ",1
"I went with a large group of family, but split into 2 groups. This was excellent because the men in their 30s and 40s did not want to go through the Princess Castle! One of our group members was from LA, and knew how to navigate through the park. We utilized the Fast Pass option when we could. It can be a very expensive day but you can bring bottled water with you which I highly recommend. We ate lunch at the barbecue place which was served family style and quite tasty. Ribs were close to being perfect!! I was exhausted at the end of the day and had difficulty getting out of the car once we arrived to the hotel. Not a spring chicken anymore! I think it would have been fun to stay in the resort area and spend a few days there, as we were not able to visit California Adventureland next door.",1
Love Disneyland and the nostalgia but this visit a number if rides broke down needs a majestic over.  As always staff are friendly and helpful.,1
Disneyland was clean and well decorated for Halloween.  We celebrated our granddaughter's 4th birthday with breakfast with Minnie and Friends.  The food was great and the characters were warm and loving.  She had a fantastic time.,1
"This was our first trip overseas with 2 children (ages 6 &2). We spent 2 full days in Disneyland. We LOVED it. My children loved it. They do need some more rides but saying that, we were busy for those whole 2 days. My daughters fav (6yr old) was its a Small World. That ride was just beautiful, amazing, and if you ride it at night, the lights are just beautiful. My sons fav ride (2yr old) was Pooh Bear. It is very cute as you sit in a honey pot to go around the ride and smile at the end for your photo. We got lots of autographs in our book, and the characters are always around. The parade was fantastic and the fireworks were just beautiful. Would love to go back again.",1
"We have a 4 year old and we bought a two day pass using the Klook app. I love HK Disney because of its small size, it was easy to get around and see everything. The rides are wonderful and the shows were amazing. We especially loved festival of the lion king. There are potable water stations near the washrooms where you can refill bottles. This is such a wonderful feature! Disappointments: I was disappointed that character greetings were marked on the brochure but when we went, there weren't any characters there. Some rides have no shaded area to stand in. Advice: bring an umbrella to make your own shade..... this will make or break your day. I hope you go and have a fun day!! ",1
I think anyone here will have a great time.  Remember that you can only hold one ride Fastpass at a time.  So get the Fastpass for the most important ride first.  And be aware of the ones that do not have a fast pass.,1
We prefer Disney to California adventure . We spent about 11 hours at Disney and 1 at California adventure . The staff is always so friendly and helpful. The longest wait was about an hour since we went on a weekday.,1
"What's there not to like about Disneyland, especially if your kids are happy! Even though I was there during a supposedly busy period (early Dec), the crowd was manageable and the queues were short. (Btw, I was there on a Thursday and Friday). About the...More",1
Our family were given tickets for Disneyland and weren't sure how long to spend there. We ended up being the first ones through the gate and the last ones out. But not because the queues were long   there was just that much to do. Download the app and see the waiting times. We averaged about 15 minutes waiting time per ride. The parades are spectacular. They have all the old favourites plus a few new cool rides. Hyper space mountain was our family favourite. And don't miss the Lion King show   it is basically a mini version of the stage show. The only small complaint is that not many of the food outlets were open and those that were open had poor quality options.,1
"My family just completed our third trip to Disneyland and California Adventure Park. There is something magical about Christmas in the parks. From the huge tree on Main Street USA to Sleeping Beauty Castle bathed in a glittering sea of lights, it is breathtaking.In addition to the usual rides this year, we had a chance to visit the major upgrades in the California Adventure Park. These included Buena Vista street, which is a throwback to the time when Walt Disney arrived in California with a suitcase, $40, and sketches of Mickey Mouse. Lots of street entertainment to see with live music and dance numbers, hand bell choir, and the nightly tree lighting ceremony. Don't miss the Newsboys and Mickey on the red trolley in the fountain area (Cathay Circle). CARSLAND   Disney has literally turned this area into its own little Route 66 town (Radiator Springs). The Radiator Springs Racers are a must, but be prepared for the longest wait time in both parks. I recommend visiting it at night while all of the glowing neon is lit. World of Color   a Winter themed world of color featuring Olaf the snowman as emcee was absolutely astonishing.Fantasmic   If you have never seen this combination of live action, lights, fountains, and fantasy then please take the opportunity to see for yourself why it is a park favorite.Our tickets included a 3 day pass with park hopper option. For the first time we braved the rain one day and were pleasantly surprised with very short wait times. Our family rode space mountain 5 times that day with only a 10 minute wait! Some attractions were closed, and some were soaking wet (Jungle Cruise). By the end of the day we were tired and wet, but had ridden multiple times on the majority of the rides we spend hours in line for. We drive to Disneyland from Kentucky because it is worth the trip. After 3 times, I can honestly say that Disneyland never disappoints!",1
We went there with young kids. The facilities were well maintained with new elements from time to time. We even bought ourselves annual pass!,1
"This was the first disneyland i went to so i didn't know what to expect. Overall, i had lot of fun and took some great pictures. Highlights:  Interesting displays, parks and structures to take photos  Souvenirs and clothing were quite reasonably priced  Staff spoke english.Lowlights:  Queues for the rides were quite long and waited on average 20 30 minutes. Maybe because it was Chinese New Year period (February).",1
Disneyland is always fun but it just seems as years goes by the prices on everything keep going up making it so many families can't even go and then the fact that they let too many people into the park which causes over 1.5 hour wait times just to ride a ride.,1
"Just returned from our Spring Break Disney vacation and had a fabulous time. It had been almost 4 years since our last time there and we were very excited to go. Yes, the lines were longer than expected, but we took the time to chit chat with others. Met people from all over. Didn't wait more than 30 minutes for anything  never used a fast pass and averaged 12 rides a day. The stand by wait times aren't accurate. Was told it would be 65 minutes for Splash Mountain and were only in line for 20. To avoid the crush into the park in the morning, board the train at Main Street. Thought this might be our last Disney vacation since the kids are getting older (10 and 13), but they and my husband are already planning for next year. Never met a single rude employee in the three days we were there. And never had a long wait for food in DL or DD. Yes, it's pricey, but expected. Only disappointments were the Matterhorn breaking down  we did get to ride it once  and the Monsters Inc. ride. After the nearly 30 minute wait, not that great. And we love the  kiddie  rides, they bring back memories of when I went with my family as a child. Have asked the family if they would like to go to DW in Florida, but they'd rather come back to California. Don't miss: Soarin', California Screamin', Indie Jones, and Splash Mountain at night!",1
"We had a 3 day 2 park park pass. It was ample for us.As we didn't attend with kids, we enjoyed watching the smiles of the other children. We enjoyed that everyone got into theme and dressed up. Girls in miney outfits and their beautiful princess dresses. We seen numerous buzz light years, woody's and Peter pans on the boys.",1
"My family are big Disney fans and my daughter (18) and I couldn't pass up the opportunity to visit Disneyland Paris while in France. We found ourselves doing a lot of comparing between the Paris park and U.S. parks. We loved the entryway coming into Disneyland Paris   it was familiar, yet different and special. We enjoyed the less crowded   shorter line atmosphere (we were fortunate to visit on a weekday while school was still in session). While we found that we prefer some U.S. versions of rides (such as Indiana Jones), we also prefer some France versions (such as Thunder Mountain Railroad) and we have new favorites that are unique to France (we LOVED Alice's Curious Labyrinth). I do agree with several of the other comments that I've seen posted, that there is an opportunity for improvements in general trash pick up in some areas and cleanliness fragrance of the toilets   I was a bit surprised that this was an issue when I think of the Disney brand.That aside, we enjoyed our day and it was well worth the visit.A couple of logistical notes:For those of you considering a side trip from Paris, we found it very easy to navigate the metro train system to make our way to Disneyland Paris. And Disneyland Paris, Walt Disney Studios and the Disney Village are all conveniently located near each other ... just a few minutes walk and you can travel from one to the other.For those of you considering purchasing your tickets online in advance, we did this and printed our tickets at home and presented them at the entrance   very easy no issues. Do note that the paper ticket you've printed is your ticket for the day   if you are using the Fast Pass machines, the Fast Pass machines have a scanner that scans the barcode on your home printed ticket.",1
"Have spent a New year eve there. Big dissapointment!Too many people, and moreover, a lot of people smoke being in the crowd among children. Smoking is not forbidden in the magic kingdom:( miss American Disneylands with their special areas for smoking.Big thunder mountain was also closed.Fireworks were not impressive.",1
"This is the 3rd Disneyland Resort I have been to and HK Disneyland did not disappoint me! The park is very accessibly by MTR. Resort goers have a wide option of rides to choose from  the mild one (Small World) to the most thrilling (like Space Mountain!). Photos that were offered as options (and not forced) were also a good fallback for visitors. Park was clean and there was assurance of our safety. There were plenty of choices for eating places. The shows, of course, bore the trademark of a Disney production, magical and entertaining! I will always want to go back! Additional tip: you may want to consider staying in the Disneyland Hotel and continue to experience the magic of Disney and be welcomed by the characters at the buffet berakfast dining place!",1
I went to visit the park with a friend (2 adults) and we had a blast. Line times were leas than 30 minutes  there were a few rides closed and I was a bit disappointed in the lack of characters that were around. The Christmas parade was great and my first time seeing it. Much smaller park than Disney world and easy to get around and see lots in one day. ,1
I recommend to spend a full day. Don't miss the 'Parade' and the Fireworks show at the end of the day. A must watch for everyone who enters Disneyland.,1
"As a father of four and a senior reviewer I decided to write a review to help big families like ours save some money at the Happiest Place on Earth. We already know about Disneyland and its greatness. If you don't, get out from under your rock, ask a friend, and research their website. So here are the tips to save money: 1. Bring food and drinks. Yes believe it or not the employees are very  accommodating  about this. They understand how expensive it is in the park so they will just remind you at the bag check that the picnic area is to the left of the entrance but they will not ask you to throw it away. The advantage to you is that they won't check your bag again at the entrance turnstyle so you can walk right in with your food. 2. When you line up for a ride, make sure you get a rider switch pass so you can ride again without having to get in another long line. You can only do this if you have a child that is not big enough to ride and one parent must stay back with that child. The pass will allow your kids to ride twice, once with you and once with mom. How does this save you money, well because the new scam that people do is to pay the handicap to ride with them so they can cut in front of the line. True story google it. 3. If you are unable to bring food there are decent prized restaurants inside Disneyland   Rancho del Zocalo Mexican Food behind Thunder Railroad. They serve big dishes to share. In California Adventure   Boardwalk Pizza and Pasta share a whole pizza. 4. Eat the food that you bring for lunch but leave the park for dinner. There are a million food choices within a 5 mile radius of the park ranging from McDonalds to Morton's Steak House. 5. You must buy a two day park hopper. It's impossible to do both parks in one day on a non busy day let alone a busy day. Although this is an expensive ticket, it's much cheaper than buying two one day tickets. As for parking, your out of luck. The only way you can save on that is if your hotel offers a free shuttle to the park. HOT TIP: Get a fast pass early in the morning for the most popular rides such as,  Radiator Springs Racers. ",1
This is my 2nd visit to Disneyland. It is predominantly for young kids. They have introduced a new roller coaster which is superb. RC racer in Toyland is also thrilling. Avengers ride is very nice with the 3d effects. The castle is under renovation till July so no fireworks and laser show. Also the Parade at 4 pm was not very big and nice. Getting vegetarian food is a challenge as only few restaurant serve veg food within Disneyland. We reached Disneyland via MTR and the metro from Sunny Bay to Disneyland is very nice. Overall Hong Kong Disneyland misses the Disney charm. ,1
"What can I say, it really is the happiest place on earth.  If you have small children, allow a few extra days so you don't have to spend 12 hour days in the park.  It can be overwhelmingly exhausting for little ones",1
I was apprehensive about visiting Disneyland as I felt it was more for young kids. As we were sopping over in LA we thought we may as well visit. Well I was pleasantly surprised. We spent 2 days there before heading to the east coast and can honestly say we needed more time. Thoroughly enjoyed it and the wow factor was incredible. Would do it again but next time allocate a few more days,1
"Amazing place for especially for families and children. Way too big to cover in one day. But you should not miss some of the rides if you just have a day. 'Little big world', 'Meet Micky Mouse' are not to be missed. And DON'T miss the Parade twice a day I think but starts one at 5PM for sure.",1
"Being from Virginia, we have always gone to Disneyworld. This is so much better! Yes it's smaller and the rides are somewhat different, but the location is awesome. We stayed at the Disneyland hotel and you can literally walk to everything. California Adventure is right across the walkway. Everything is walkable unless you have walking disabilities (then they offer a monorail). We thoroughly enjoyed this trip. The area with the princesses was a madhouse but otherwise it wasn't too crazy when we were there.",1
"Disneyland Park is a wonderful delight. Of course it has a lot to live up to always being compared to Disney World. First Disneyland is much smaller than Disney World. It has just as many rides as the Magic Kingdom in Florida, just more compact. So this can make it less stressful on your feet, but the crowds can seem overwhelming. Must do Rides  Use Fastpass where available. Even when the park isn't too busy you can ride your favorite ride several times by utilizing Fastpass.Space Mountain, yes it is a roller coaster but the thrills come from the ride being in the dark and from sharp turns, rather than big drops.Indiana Jones, this ride is a unique experience and one you can't find in Florida. You are in a  jeep  going through Indiana's adventures. The ride is mostly bumpy with no drops.Haunted Mansion, This ride is slow and suitable for anyone who doesn't like the big thrill rides. Although it may scare small children as it is a haunted mansion. The ghosts don't jump out and scare but dance around, talk and go about their day. This ride is just very unique as you look around at all the ghostly action. You can see something new each time you ride.Splash Mountain, You may get wet, but on a hot day you will dry pretty fast. This ride is pretty mellow besides the big drop and has a wonderful story following Brer Rabbit. On a hot day, Fastpass is a must.Big Thunder Mountain Railroad, This is a roller coaster but without the large drops. When you are descending down you are turning and twisting your way down. Fantasmic!  This is a wonderful show with water, fire, several Disney Characters, boats, movie and live action. The whole family will love it. It is definitely worth it to get there early and get a spot to watch the show.Overall Disneyland Park is a clean, friendly park. It doesn't have all the pizzazz of Disneyworld but it was built by Disney himself. If you are a big Disney fan you will appreciate the history in the park and probably have a bit of fun too.",1
Our 2 days at the park was enjoyable except for a few rides that were under reconstruction and the 3 that actually had broken down that day. The selection of food at Disney is so so except for the excellent Large Smoked Slow Cooked Turkey Leg (this is worth finding). The food available on the California park side was much better.,1
"We just returned from 4 days staying at the Santa Fe Hotel in Disneyland and had a great time. The staff were all very friendly both at the hotel and in the park. Our favourite rides were the Tower of Terror, Space Mountain,Thunder Mesa, and Indiana Jones for sheer scream your head off fun. The Haunted Manor was also really good and looked great at twilight. My daughter and I really enjoyed the sweetness of A Small World and the Mad Hatters Teacups was a good laugh. Small and big kids will love the Buzz Lightyear ride too. The parade at 7 and the Disney Dreams light show at 11 are a must see but be prepared to feel a bit emotional. My only gripe is that a lot of the adrenaline rides appear to have technical difficulties and information is not always relayed in English, we spent 20 minutes at the broken down Aerosmith rollercoaster before we were told to leave. The 2 hours extra time in the morning for residents of the Disneypark was a bit pointless as the only rides open were in Futureland and even then a couple were shut due to technical difficulties. Water and juice are very overpriced at around    3.50 for a small bottle and the water from the water fountains was warm and gave us dodgy tummies. The food is also quite expensive so I would highly recommend getting a half board pass. The budget pasta and pizza joints were cheap enough but had a very limited menu and the frozen pizza was a bit undercooked. On the other hand the Silver Spur Saloon in Frontierland was amazing, just book a table as it gets pretty busy, the food was excellent and the staff were pretty cool. It was very hot when we went and a fan would have been a welcome buy but Disney has missed a trick by not selling them. The Disney shops are all much of a muchness, we found the Frontierland ones had the best range. Keep your receipts as if you want to return or exchange anything they will not do it without one as I found to my cost. All in all it was a fun experience and I would definitely go again, there were rides that suited both my teenage son and daughter but take plenty of money, it is extortionate.",1
I went to Hongkong Disneyland and It was a beautiful place for every one to get experiences and come back to their childhood,1
"No matter what age or marital status, Disney is always my favorite place. The shows and rides are fantastic, I keep coming back. Definitely for all ages!",1
"What is there not to like about Disneyland? You must visit this theme park, you will not be disappointed.",1
I love Disneyland and especially between November and December when they decorate for Christmas!  Overall great fun!!,1
"It is very clean, well maintained and not too crowded. The parade is exceptional and my kid (and I) loves it. You can save some money by buying your entry & meal ticket online at discounted price.I wish there are more rides available for kids aged 5 & under. One of the attractions is under maintenance. I only took photos with Mickey, Minnie and Donald. Can't spot Pluto and Goofy at all.",1
"A lifetime of dreaming about Disney, and what can I say? For me, my two days were living the dream. We went on a Thursday and a Saturday, and the difference was extraordinary. Thursday we had no queue longer than ten minutes! We went on twelve rides, counting our two turns each on Space Mountain, Buzz Lightyear, and Indy Jones' Temple of Peril. These three were my favourites, along with Star Tours and Captain Eo (best for MJ fans). Saturday, though, we faced queues of 30 minutes or more even for Peter Pan, and Thunder Mountain was closed from lunchtime for some reason. Food was    10 for the child's meals, so be prepared and stock up on snacks and drinks outside the park. You can take them in, in sensible amounts. We only window shopped and focussed on the rides. One tip, there are two apps produced for Disney parks, one is a map and one provides wait times to the hot ticket rides. Use both... If you do not face roaming charges.",1
"There were a lot of attractions for all ages, but there were a few rides closed for refurbishment as well as some of the rides broke down quite a lot, especially the buzz lightyear ride! We hired a pushchair which was stolen towards the end of the day, which is not great when you have a $70 deposit to collect on it. One of the perks from staying in the disney hotel is that you can access the parks 2 hours before they open, however it later came to light that this was only the disneyland park and only areas. ",1
Found the Parade was great. It was really hot when we were there.. Not much shade provided unless you were on a ride.  would have liked some more water attractions especially for young kids. Overheated is not a good look!,1
"Disneyland really is magical. The attention to detail on every building, ride & attraction adds to the atmosphere. The smells & the music take you to another world & it's easy to forget your cares & worries the minute you enter the door.My husband and I were excited to arrive just as winter celebrations began. Although our first day in the park was a rainy, cold one, we enjoyed it thouroughly. Being in the park out of season meant that we barely waited to go on the rides & we managed to do everything in one day.I can't wait to come back again.",1
"I am handicapped and they were very nice to give me timed tickets, so I did not have to stand in line at the rides. I could sit on the bench near the ride and walk up in 30 90 minutes later (same time I would have gone in if I stood in line).",1
"Although there are two parks in Paris, this is of course the main park that is attractive for people of all ages. From 'it's a small world' for the very little ones to attractions like Space Mountain for the older ones. The park is well maintained and the staff is very friendly and helpful. It is the typical quality that you can always expect from Disney Theme Parks.Be however prepared that the Park is quite large and you will have to walk long distances that will be very tiring for the younger children. I have seen this cause a lot of stress by parents so my advice is to prepare well and only target the attractions that you like best.On top of that, most of the major attractions have a systems called Fastpass where you can get tickets upfront to return at a set point in time to avoid the longer queues. This can be very helpful so study that upfront as well (it is not that difficult). The previous two advises are especially useful on busy days (which is basically all holidays and weekends). Disney also lowers the capacity of the rides on the less busy days so there are almost always waiting times at the most popular attractions.The Entrance fee is expensive and most of the food in the restaurants is also slightly on the expensive side. There is however a large variety of restaurants and my advise is to be there early on busy days.",1
"We were thinking between Ocean Park and Disneyland and decided on the latter. Though full of kids, we had a great time doing most of the adult rides.  I especially enjoyed RC Racer!",1
Fulfilled all expectations. Although not as big as Anaheim it is such a mini version of. It is definitely a very full day and night. Recommend seeing the day and night Main Street parades. Follow the map and do land by land. Very clean and worth a visit at any age.,1
"Like all Disney parks, over priced, but needs to be done! You don't need kids to visit this! Take at least 2 full days to do both parks, but longer if you can. Allow times for queues, visited on a weekday and about 30 mins wait for rides, so not bad at all. Drinks and food expensive. SNCF, bus station and taxis directly in front of parks.",1
My 6 year old had a time of his life here.If your the kind who likes to take it slow without rushing then you need to keep aside a full day for this one. More so because there is no express pass here so which means you will have to stand in every line which can get quite tedious for the little one. The best thing was the 3D show Interactive Stitch Autopia Slinky Dog ride etc... Everything runs with clockwork precision and safety standards are really high.Prams are available for a small fee and if not for anything else its a great idea atleast to hold your bags in it : ) Entirely a fun filled adventure.,1
"Expensive, crowded, but a must, to be experienced, at least once in a life, for any child and parent who lived childhood's Disney dream stories. Hopefully promises to enlarge the park and set new attractions will come true.If possible better visit on low season, otherwise get prepared for long queues.",1
"Been here before but it was the first time we took our son who is 3. The Disney Magic was perfect as always, cannot fault anything!",1
"It was a magical trip for our 2 year olds birthday. We spent 3 days in the park and did everything we possible could. We met most of the characters but had to queue up for over an hour each so some characters we just looked at from afar. Make sure you get fast pass tickets for the rides you want to do, it gets very busy!",1
Get tickets in advance as queues can be hectic. If you get there really early when it's quieter then you can actually get on the rides and don't forget to use Fastpass!,1
"Just got back from staying at Disney New York Hotel at Disneyland Paris. We arrived on Sat 11 April til Wed 15 April. Family of 4 with 2 boys aged 9 and 10. Found the staff very friendly especially in the shops and restaurants. I was under the impression that it was meant to be a no smoking venue with designated places but everyone just seemed to light up whenever and staff just ignored it. Worst was when your waiting for a parade or light show and all you can smell is cigarette smoke. Was disappointed with the character signings, not very well advertised, for example Donald the Duck was by the band stand the next day it was Pluto! Then walking around we stumbled upon Chip and Dale! Also found people very rude and willing to push kids out the way to get to a ride! Not impressed with the toilets within the park, they are not monitored very well and some were so disgusting turned your stomach! I did read tips on here re taking an empty bottle and refilling it within the park at the water fountains...none of them worked! Yes the queues were long at times but there was things to look at, read or take pictures of. Hotel was fab! Room very clean and big! The only thing we didn't like was the restaurant Parkside buffet, ok for adults but not much choice for kids. On one of the day we saw a child on another table with a bowl of chips, I asked the chef if chips are available and he said no, I then asked the CM if chips had to be ordered she had to go ask the manager they both spoke in French which I thought was rude, she then explained the child had an allergy, ok fair enough but if another child sees chips they will want them too, which I stated to her which her response was shall I get you a bowl? Still no chips on the kids section. It was a very tiring holiday but worth it. Would recommend booking any restaurants that you want to dine in before you go. Also look for tips on here which I found very useful.",1
"Planned ahead and had a great time. Spent 3 days and rode everything more than once. Go early, you can ride the best rides during the early morning hours",1
"We have just retuend from a 3night 4 day break at DLP and it was just AMAZING! It was my first visit to a Disney park but my partner and his son have been to Florida, so I was a little worried that it would not be so good for them, however they also loved it too and said it was just as good as Florida, just on a smaller scale,which is perfect for a short visit.Entering the park via Disney Village and seeing first the Disneyland Hotel and then Sleeping Beauty's Castle just absolutely took my breath away, it was so beautiful. I didn't think anything could beat it until I saw the evening show & fireworks display, which actually brought a tear to my eye.The rides are great and there's something for all ages. We were a little disappointed that the Pirates of the Carribean ride was out for maintenance but we knew that before we went. We didn't manage to make Crush's Coaster becuase it was broken down on our last morning however we made up for it by experiencing the fantastic Ratatouille 3D ride instead.I'm not a huge rollercoaster fan but my partner is and he throughly enjoyed the Rock n Rollercoaster, Big Thunder Mountain, Hyperspace Mountain and the Indiana Jones ride. Tower of Terror was terrifying but strangely exhilarating! Plenty of rides for the younger kids too.There is just too much to mention and we loved everything. Yes there were queues sometimes but that's to be expected at such a popular park at the weekend. Cannot wait to return and feel the magic once again.",1
"We visited for 6 days in February 2013 from Australia, and we had the best time together. This is such a magical place that both adults and children can genuinely enjoy together. There is so much to see here, even in 6 days we didn't see everything. My daughter loved all the characters, the parades, and the rides. It was a holiday we will never forget. The first few days were quiet, and a few of the major rides were closed, but the shorter lines were definitely worth missing a few rides. Towards President's day weekend it became packed, however we had already went on most of the rides, and so were able to go on the rides that had opened after refurbishment and enjoy the parades.The weather was fine, only one drizzly cooler day during the whole week. The parks were open from 10am  8pm which was sufficient with a young child, and to 11pm on the weekend.It's definitely worth coming during less busy weeks of the year. Check the crowd predictor calendars to work out the best times. Waiting 2 hours in line with children can be miserable.All the staff here were so friendly and helpful. The park is clean, there are bathrooms everywhere (perfect with little ones), and places to grab something at every corner.The Bibbidi Bobbidi Boutique was so special for my little princess, highly recommended. We did the crown package which was about $60 and also bought a dress, they transform their hair into a princess style, paint their fingernails, put some light make up on etc. You get to take home a special bag, a make up palette, two nail polishes, a tiara and several cute other goodies. Also if it's your first visit, make sure you come through the main entrance and not on the monorail to tomorrow land so you can get all the park maps and meet the many characters on main street. Do a bit of research (there is so much excellent information online) to plan the attractions you would like to visit, check before hand if your children are tall enough for certain rides, and learn how the fasspass works. I was so surprised how many people were unaware fastpasses existed, and they are very useful.Enjoy!!!",1
"Costly, but fun. The park has been doubled in size. It is even fun riding the special mickey mouse mtr train to the park. The Park is the cleanest place in Asia (excepting Singapore Sentosa). It could easily take up two days of activities. The special shows are hard to fit in your schedule but are must see activities. The ride lines are long even when the park is empty, so concentrate on attending the shows. You will come away with a thousand beautiful pictures so don't forget you camera. Remember to get you picture taking with Mickey!",1
The disney experience! Would have given it five stars but a lot of the rides were not open. Definitely do the startours ride and Indiana Jones ride. Use fastpass otherwise will be stuck in lines. Much smaller than Florida.,1
"Even though I am a big kid, I did enjoy visiting Disneyland, a lot of the rides were more for the kids, but it was still an experience worth doing.",1
"Going to and from HK Disneyland via the MTR is very efficient and organized. Train stations are clean, wide, and the routes are easy to understand. There are more rides and shows now than 4 years ago. Restaurants are a bit costly inside Disneyland so it is best to eat first before going there.",1
"What a wonderful place. Simply magical for young and old. Had a fantastic time and everyone should go at least once. This was our second time of going, and certainly won't be our last.",1
"If you have any kids, this is the place to be.  Even some adults like it!  Do not miss Minnie and Mickey Mouse!",1
"A spotless amusement park with no shortage of shops selling food and drink, very necessary in hot weather. We visited in the first week of October   a bad choice. This is the holiday season on the mainland and thousands of tourists pour in for the celebration.Queues moved quite fast, and there were some very long ones.The halloween procession was a bit scary for a sensative seven year old but all the other attractions were as good as had been hoped for",1
Make sure you buy your tickets online for a shorter queue. You will be able to enter early to take photos with the mascots and shop at the retail outlets. Fastpass service at space mountain is useful. Not much heart dropping rides so it is most certainly good for children. Be sure to go early for the fireworks for a good view in front of the castle.,1
"We took our 2 girls, 7 & 4 here in December and had a ball. They were able to go on most rides   with the exception of grizzly gulch. They loved them all except space mountain. Really clean park with lots of cafes, toilets etc all over. The flights of fantasy parade was fab and a must see   they even put on fake snow for us when they lit the massive christmas tree up, was very cool. We found the food expensive as with theme parks anywhere in the world but the souvenir shops were very reasonably prices. 1 day was enough to get around and see do it all.",1
"Lovely place to come anytime but it was quite unique at Christmas.Sky was blue & no crowds during our stay ,although the Saturday was much busier.Again queues & methods are questionable especially for impromptu character greeting & princess fast pass registration.A intolerable wait to get a fast pass to avoid long queues & then you only actually get to see 1 princess.A major rethink is needed on this 1 & much grumbling about the inconsistencies as regards entry & registrations from those who had done previously.Other than that lines were short & a wonderful break was had.Disappointed Thunder mountain was out of service & several dining options closed.Wifi is non existent & we had issues with pictures being loaded onto our expensive photo pass.This is unacceptable as it is an expensive break.We found we used our extra hours queuing for characters & must have waited 2 hrs for Mickey greeting.Surely this needs to be addressed?Florida queues are not even that long!Wifi situation is abysmal & needs immediate improvement as app is useless.However rides & shows are amazing.Christmas parade will be a memory lasting a lifetime & night show truly exceptional .",1
"Been to Florida, California and Paris numerous times. Having just returned again and enjoyed the Christmas activities I now think this is my favourite individual Disney park of all. It is absolutely stunning!The Christmas cavalcade is beautiful and full of Christmas cheer. The Xmas Dreams over the castle is also stunning. Individual rides and attractions are really good. The Buzz Lightyear attraction is great. Pirates of the Caribbean is great (though Jack Sparrow is nowhere to be seen). Big Thunder Mountain, WOW. Any Disney fan from Europe who hasn't been here is missing out and should do so ASAP.We will be back!",1
This was our first ever visit to any of the Disneyland attractions and we were not disappointed. We only had tickets for two days however and it was all a bit of a rush. We actually didn't see everything. We are not a roller coaster family but my husband did do Space Mountain and said it was very good. In terms of recommendations I would personally say that the Pirates of the Caribbean and the Ratatouille rides are a must! The parades were amazing and the Disney Dreams light show at night is truly breathtaking.  Cast Members  were so friendly across the park. The food is expensive but not quite as bad as I had feared and there is no escaping the many many gift merchandise shops. A wonderful experience which I hope to repeat.,1
"we expected more. comparing eg.with PortAventura in Spain it is not so exciting. adults and kids even liked more Disney studios than the main park. Its better and cheaper to buy the tickets prior by internet, on place 1day ticket 1 park for adult costs 75 EUR, 2 parks 90 EUR, for kid 67 EUR. If You travel with group try to buy the tickets in travel agencies   the prices will be 59 EUR for adult and 52 for kid.",1
"Another Awsome, Magical, Special experience for my kids!! Thanks to all the cast members and the maintenance personnel for keeping this place, Clean and well maintained. Shout out to Chewbacca!! He was so nice to my kids.      ",1
"we were visiting with family in May, albeit we were all adults. we opted for a 2 park 1 day ticket. we found this was fine for our needs. we were there for rope drop and stayed till 1030. we went on all the things we wanted to go on and one of our group met a few of the characters as well. great visit and another disney park off our list",1
"I took my 12 (almost 13) year old son to Disneyland (all the way from New Zealand) during the Christmas holidays. If I had the chance to do it again, I would choose a different time.We had a 3 day Hopper pass (29 31 December) which enabled us to visit both Disneyland and California Adventure Park (unlimited entries) on the same day. The problem was that on the first day we had to queue for over an hour at the ticket booth to exchange our voucher for entry tickets. Then once we got our tickets, we were told that Disneyland was FULL and that we were unable to enter the park until after 5.30pm!! However, we could go to California Adventure Park (next door) to fill in the intervening 6 hours. I have to say that it was very disappointing   and unexpected   to fly over 10,000 kms to Disneyland and be told you can't go in.California Adventure Park was also very busy, but manageable. We soon got the hang of using the FastPass system   essential if you don't wan't to spend most of your day standing in a queue. Disneyland was still crowded after 5.30pm and it was difficult to get our bearings in the dark so we didn't stay long.The second day we had a 'Magic Morning' pass (as part of the 3 day Hopper) which meant we (along with quite a few other people) could get into Disneyland at 7am   an hour before it opened to the public. It was definitely worth getting up early and we went on the popular rides like Space Mountain (twice) and Star Tours without having to queue. This was the best part of the whole experience. The park soon filled up and I must say I have never seen so many strollers in one place at one time!The third day   New Year's Eve   we managed to get a FastPass for Radiator Springs at 11am that told us to return at our allocated time slot which was 10 11pm that night   11 hours later! (NB Return time depends on how many passes have already been allocated and FastPasses do run out for the day after a specific number have been allocated.) We did a split day   a few hours at a very crowded Disneyland, back to the hotel for a swim and dinner, and then back for the marvel of being at Disneyland at midnight on New Year's Eve. The fireworks over Sleeping Beauty's Castle were spectacular (even more so than usual) and Main Street was crammed full of thousands and thousands of bodies gazing skyward, so it was certainly a memorable way to see in the New Year.It was magical to see Disneyland all decorated for the holidays (including fake falling snow) and the attractions with a holiday twist (It's A Small World was wonderful with it's Christmas theming) but the crowds and long wait times did manage to dull the magic a little. Go when it's quieter.",1
"Much busier in July than when I visited in January but that's expected. Longest wait we had was about 45 mins. Nice the parade runs 4:30 and 6:00 and most characters were out thru park for pics. Also, fireworks were at 9:30pm perfect time for kids. ",1
"We frequently visit Disney World in Orlando. You can't compare the parks 1 for 1. They are different. We had a limited amount of time and spend one full day in this park. With a little planning and some luck, we were able to do everything we wanted in one day. This park is more compact than Disney World so you don't have long walks between attractions. It delivers everything you'd expect from Disney. The rides are entertaining and lots of fun!",1
I love this place! But then again who doesn't . It's got rides to thrill adults and kids alike. Personally I love Indiana Jones and my son loves etopia cars. It really is the happiest place on earth!  Keep up the good work!,1
My boys are 8 and 11... the best place to visit!  Thanks disney you did not disappoint!  I would love to come back with my kids as soon as possible.,1
"For the young and old, it's still a wonderful place to go! Be sure to take your time and wear the most comfortable shoes you can find. It's almost imperative to get a 3 day hopper ticket (plus a day or two more) because you just cannot see everything in one visit. The water show at night is a must see. Vie for VIP seating close to the fountains (you may get wet) because it is a long production and putting the young kids on your shoulders so they can see, can be very tiring. I loved the experience and I can almost guarantee you will too.",1
I was expecting a massive plastic ish park but to my surprise it has a very good taste. The park is beautiful and the characters look so real you cannot stop yourself from waiving at them!Recommend to stay in a disney hotel due to distance and easy to get there at 8 am  before everybody else to go on the rides and get the characters autographs without having to queue too long. After 6 pm is quieter too :)I would love to go back. There is so much to do!Oh I highly recommend the Frozen sing a long! That show is very colourful and full of life. My whole family loved it!,1
Took our granddaughter who will turn three next month to her first visit at Disneyland. The park wasn't as crowded as in past visits so we were able to take her on more rides then planned. Got to the park when it opened at 9 AM and closed it up at 11 PM. Shehad a wonderful time and the weather was beautiful. Everyone was cheerful and helpful and it remains the  Happiest Place on Earth. ,1
"We have been coming to Disneyland for the last few years and have always had a great time! It's always been a dream to go during Christmas! The decorations were great and the rides and parades didn't disappoint! The only downfall is that there was too many people there and I mean too many!!!!! And lots of them sick and coughing all over the place needless to say my kids came home with the flu! Ugh... also it was very hard to find places to sit to eat and lines were long for everything, even the bathroom!!!! I would like to know if there are better times of year to go because this was ridiculous?!? ",1
"Awesome. Great Disney experience. Need to play it smart otherwise you'll spend an absolute fortune, however read the forums and get hintsand tips. Like take a buggy for little ones and snacks throughout the day. Go nuts, enjoy.",1
"I recently went to the Disneyland Park in Anaheim, CA and I must say it was amazing! Everything was wonderful from the food and live entertainment, to the Characters and awesome rides! I must say my personal favorite rides are Indiana Jones, Splash Mountain, and the Pirates of the Caribbean. While on Pirates of the Caribbean I saw and indoor reasturaunt that looks very interesting and a place I would like to go very much! Disneyland Brought my famliy together and helped us make wonderful memories!",1
"Perhaps it was my timing but HK Disneyland was missing something this time around. Lots of new and current characters abound but the land area hasn't increased to accommodate the extra additions. Many of the old favorites were missing this time   or perhaps they are no longer there! There does not appear to be any  Crowd control  they just kept arriving and being allowed entry   surely there is, or should be, a maximum limit! The most famous structure, well, Disney one that it, is the Castle. Once you could walk thru, into or around but not on my day. The lower 40% or so was covered up. A pic of the upper portion was still quite good and would give the littlies a thrill. Refreshments etc quite fairly priced.",1
"We ( husband, myself and 2 kids, 9 & 11) went to Hong Kong Disney in April 2015, on a weekday.First thing I noticed was that it was not at all crowded. I have visited the other Disneylands in Anaheim, Tokyo and Paris, and was used to big crowds and long lines. The longest we had to wait for a ride was 20 minutes for Space Mountain, the other rides were a 5 or 10 minute wait only. It is also much smaller than the other Disneylands, so it was easier to get around. You could actually do this park in a day, whereas you would need at least 2 days for the other Disneylands.The food is expensive, but there is a good range of fussy kid friendly options. It makes sense to take in your own picnic though, to keep costs down.Definitely see the Lion King Spectacular show though, it was only 30 minutes, but it was wonderfully done, with great singing and dancing and giant puppets.",1
My favourite ride is Big Thunder Mountain. It is better than the ride in Magic Kingdom. Buzz Lightyear is excellent as well. Most of the rides are focussed on younger family members. our grandchildren loved Peter Pan. A pity that more of the rides aren't open during the extra magic hours gained by staying in a Disney hotel.,1
"Wow! Wow! Wow! Over 10 trips to Disney in America and I have never felt the  Magic . Disneyland Paris made me feel the  Magic  that I have heard so many people talk about. If you can't go, watch 2017 Christmas videos of Disneyland Paris on your favorite social media station. You will see what I mean. Incredible! Great job Disney! ",1
"We went to Disneyland during 2016 Christmas season.This is our third Disneyland after Hong Kong and Paris . This is the nicest of all without doubt.It is really nice ambience especially during Christmas,the only downside was the queing time for the rides is always Long but worth the time and the crowd which make you worry yr little one might just get lost in it.In this park, we like the haunted mansion, Indiana jones and a few others . We won't be able to finish all ride in one day during the busy period. The show at night is really good , they have different type throughout the different days so check yr schedule and plan well.Always get the fast pass but you only can hold one at a time so if you been before you can really maximise the usage of it . Other than that just go with the flow and enjoy your family precious time together because while queuing and wait there is a lot of catch up can be done !! Disneyland just never go wrong !!",1
"Had an absolute fantastic time, weather good crowds down low.  Staff always friendly and helpful would recommend this time of year for any Australian thinking of going",1
"Disneyland is a happy and magical place! We had the best visit last week celebrating my daughter Molly's 4th birthday! Everywhere she went friendly cast members wished her a Happy Birthday and gave her stickers, pins, and cupcakes at restaurants like Minnie & friends. Jim a 26 year DIsney cast member was so friendly to us and wrote a lovely message in my daughters book at MInnie & friends breakfast. There were tons of characters everywhere from princesses in fantasy faire, toon town with Mickey & friends, and many locations throughout the park. They were all so friendly and interacted so sweetly with my four year old from hugs, dancing, and kind gestures & words. Splash mountain is a blast as well as buzz light year ride. The updated Matterhorn was really fun and the frozen show at fantasy faire was really well acted and funny, a must see for anyone. The bibbidi bobbidi boutique was an amazing experience, Samantha was the fairy godmother in training who helped my daughter become Princess Tiana. She was so sweet and did an amazing job putting Molly's hair in a bun with tiara and Mickey barrette, makeup, face jewels, sash,& pink backpack. This was such a fun experience, not to be missed, but make an appointment well in advance. There are many awesome foods from dole whips in Adventureland to gumbo in New Orleans Square, and an amazing all you can eat bbq at Big Thunder ranch, everything was delicious( my husband loved the ribs & chicken) while my daughter and I who are vegetarians had awesome veg and tofu kabobs as well as cornbread,coleslaw,beans,and drinks. Alex was a awesome waiter as well as the hostesses. Minnie & friends breakfast was excellent too especially the Mickey waffles with caramel and bananas and lots of characters from Captain Hook to Rafiki to fairy godmother and many more! Disneyland is such a wonderful place with happiness everywhere you turn. ",1
"I have been going to Disneyland since it opened and I am never tired of going. It is wonderful even if you never get on a ride! The flowers and greenery are magnificent and there are very interesting restaurants. I get as excited as my grandchildren   and go every chance I get. Now I have an annual pass! You have to let go of reality and move into a dream. Staff are very helpful and characters spend time with visitors   great for every age kid! Always like to eat at the Blue Bayou and some great new places in California Adventure. Spend part of every visit at Downtown Disney   shopping, dining, listening to music, etc. I do confess that I prefer going off season and at non holiday times   easier to go on rides, eat, and marvel at the setting.",1
"Words cannot describe the amazing experiences I have with my family at Disneyland. I get the  goosey's  when I think about the memories that the Disneyland magic builds. Right from the moment I walk into the park, I feel it as i walk under the classic bridge and into the busy street of Main Street. It brings such a happiness to your heart. Disneyland brings out the kid in me singing to the catchy tunes of the classic Disney Movies and what not. I love looking around at all the people and seeing all the smiles on their faces as they wait in line of their favorite ride. It's the experience of a lifetime. You can never get tired of going to Disneyland. You can tell that the park was well thought out. The layout of it all is so organized and easy to get around. There are so many different ways to get to the location in the park you want to get to. There are some parks where you walk into the middle of the park and all of the amusements and rides are all in a straight line so getting from one place to another is kind of a challenge but Disneyland is in a circle, you could say. There are so many paths and shortcuts to take to get from one land to another. One of Disneyland's most famous landmarks is The Sleeping Beauty Castle. That right there is what makes Disneyland, Disneyland. The beautiful pink exterior and the classic looking drawbridge makes you feel like you are in the stories of the princesses. The designers of the park did such an amazing job to make everything in the park look like everything in the movies. Out of all the parks in the whole world, I'd choose Disneyland to go to. Disneyland is home of happiness.",1
"As my first Disneyland, HK Disneyland lives up to expectations. Even though I only spent a couple of hours in the park (5 PM to closing time, which is at 9 PM), it was truly a magical experience. I missed the 3 PM parade but I was able to watch the new Disney Paint the Night Parade, the Christmas Tree Lighting, and the Disney in the Stars fireworks show. I think pre Christmas is one of the best times to visit because there are a lot of shows   plus the Christmas y ambiance of the entire park is wonderful. Special note: I was only able to ride two rides   both dark rides! The Mystic Manor ride was so cool. It wasn't your run of the mill ride   an experience you wouldn't want to miss. There's a reason why it's called a 'dark' ride.",1
As always a visit to the magic kingdom is wonderful. We have been a number of times and it never fails to deliver. We particularly liked star tours ride and would recommend this to anyone. The pirates of the Caribbean is still a favourite even after all this time. Well worth the money to go but be warned queues are very long at this time of year so choose when you go carefully. ,1
Visited the park from the 6th November   11th. waited in the Q's on average an hour at a time or 20 minutes using the  fast pass   but that was expected as it was the weekend. Rides were good fun and if u have children...More,1
"i brought my kids to hongkong disney in july 2016..its so terribly hot!be sure to bring umbrellas..in my experience,we arrived there 11:30 already,and the line is short..be sure to buy ticket on line..we bought ours on klook.com..so you dont have to fall in line.use the fast track ticket in 2 rides..we use ours on space mountain in tomorrow land..weeh!that ride is so great!be sure to wait for the night parade and fire works ,its worth it! and the ride at night ...the queque is shorter already..so the not so good ride,dont waste your time queqing it if you plan to stay until disney closing at night,because the line will be shorter at 6pm already..well..this was our experience..the food inside disney..lunch at royal banquet is 115 hkd minimum for steak menu but not yet have softdrinks..you can buy your food vouchers online too..so its more cheap,ut at 12 noon,i bet that there will be no table for you,so you have to come to disney with heavy breakfast then just eat lunch at 2 to 3 pm..",1
The longest we waited in line for any ride was 30 minutes.  Buzz Lightyear is a favorite and we walked right on once.  Matterhorn was closed.  The fireworks were great.  Had a fantastic chicken strawberry spinach salad!!,1
"Disneyland! Who doesn't love Disneyland! Even if you don't have much time, I highly recommend one whole day at Disneyland and another whole day at California Adventure. That's all the time we had. This last trip we went in January with a 8 year old, a 2 month old, nana, aunty, mom and dad. So 6 of us total. This was my 8 year old's first trip to Disneyland. We knew we wouldn't be able to park hop so we saved a little bit of money by not getting the park hopper. We just made sure to go to the right park on the day that we wanted to see the special event (like world of wonder or the parade) Be sure to check the schedules ahead of time. Because we went during a not so busy time of the year, they weren't doing the Aladdin show during the week (we were there wednesday and thursday) We also knew that we wouldn't be able to do all of the rides in the one day we had at each park so my son and I went over all of the rides and I had him pick 10 rides that we definitely wanted to get to. We also had a few additional rides that the adults wanted to do on the list as well as some other shows and special things. We made sure the Jedi training academy was also on our schedule. We definitely took advantage of the baby swap. 2 of us plus the 8 year old went on the ride first while the other one stayed behind with the baby. you just tell the cast member when you before you board the ride and they give you a pass to use the fast pass lane. When they were done the other one of us went on the ride along with the 8 year old again. So my son got to go on some of the rides twice. Rewind a little bit at the beginning of the day. Be sure to get to the gate atleast 10 minutes before the gates open. If you get the early morning entry, be sure to take advantage of that. We also went to customer service and got a pin for my son for his first time visit and one for my mother in law for her birthday. And all day long everyone was saying happy birthday to my mother in law. So if this is your first time or if you're celebrating a special occasion, be sure to stop by and get your souviner pins. As far as meeting the characters go, in the morning Mickey and Minnie always seem to be out front. For a souviner for my son, we went to target the day before and got him a t shirt so the characters can sign it for him. I thought this was better than the autograph book so he would have something he can wear for another couple of years. if you want to do this you need to make sure that you're not wearing the shirt, they can't sign shirts if they are wearing it. I ended up having to buy my son a new shirt. Right at the entrance that day we saw Minnie, alice in wonderland, the mad hatter, goofy, chip and dale. We went and saw pooh and eeyore out by the Winnie the pooh ride. We also saw Donald and Daisy in toon town in the evening. And waited in line to see Mickey at Mickey's house. We ended up seeing goofy again too. After that we saw Merida. At night right as we were walking out of the park we saw Mickey and Minnie again too. For other souviners we also went around and got penny presses wherever we could find them. We brought a roll of pennies and quarters with us for this. We probably made 10 15 of them and also bought a penny press book. We also did the Jedi training academy. I believe they have several times a day that they do that. We made sure to get there 30 minutes before the start of the show and had my son sit down early. You really need to make sure that they are excited about it so that they can pick you. But be sure to tell the kids if they don't get picked they need to not get upset. Not all kids get picked but they sure to try. As far as food goes, the official rule is that you cannot bring in food or drinks. But as long as you are not bringing in a full meal for everyone they are ok with it. We brought a small soft sided cooler and filled it with 1 bottle of water (frozen, this will act as ice to keep everything cold and melt along the way so you can drink later) make sure to wrap a paper towel around it absorb the condensation. another bottle of water (cold) and a few snacks (cliff bars) and a couple uncrustable sandwiches (frozen pb&j) I also made sure my son had a fanny pack and he carried a juice pouch and 2 cliff bars with him. For lunch we had soup bread bowls by the pirates of the Caribbean ride. cheap (for theme park) and filling for everyone. not much seating so we just sat wherever there was a spot. We also ate at the caf   at the Jedi training academy. Nothing fancy there. Everything in the theme park is expensive so just make sure to budget for it. I also heard that the fried chicken at the plaza inn is very good, but we didn't get to try it.The rides are all great! My son didn't like the Indiana jones ride so much, so it's a good thing we did that first. But we wanted him to try it. The rest of the day was good after that. Since we were there in January it wasn't as busy. We were able to get through all of the rides that we wanted to and didn't wait more than 20 minutes for any ride. Most of the rides were 10 minutes or under. We even went on some of the rides a couple times. Disneyland is expensive, not going to lie about that, but its worth the experience. Just be sure to budget well. Be sure to also have a budget for ears. We all got ears and also got our names stitched in them and the year. Its fun for everyone, old and young! If you have littler ones 4 6 years then staying near the park isn't a bad idea so you can go back to take naps. Our son was 8 so we didn't need to go back to our hotel. We just went all day and crashed really hard at night. We didn't stay near the park. On one day we drove to the park and parked in the garage. Its very convenient. Everyone whether you're a kid or an adult should visit Disneyland at some point! Put it on your bucket list!.",1
"After a ten year Disney break I have had the fortune to visit Disneyland Paris twice this year as an adult. The first time was in early December at the Hotel Cheyenne and the second was in August staying in the Kyriad.Things are certainly different from an adult perspective, the cost of food, the maintenance issues and lack of shows etc due to funding being piled into Dreams and 20th birthday celebrations.Admittedly they do need to try and bring the park up to previous standards, it is looking a little run down and tired especially in the summer.However! I had an absolutely wonderful time if you allow yourself to be swept up into the fun. I personally preferred the Christmas season and am returning again this December! There is something magical about Disney that even though it isn't perfect, you can't help but feel like you're somewhere special.",1
"What's not to like about Disneyland Park! Well, it would have been nice if the Storm Troopers stopped so we could get of picture of the little ones with them. I truly think the thing I liked the most was the fact that we could bring water and our own food in to the parks. It gets very expensive to eat there all of the time. The bus system outside of the park is awesome.",1
"From start to finish for me this visit was absolutely amazing I am 47 years old and visited with a family friend who has Down syndrome ,many times I was close to years this experience will be hard to top .We had 2 full days in the park and stayed at Newport Bay hotel ,all staff were most helpful and the atmosphere was magical . After a very busy day in the park we decided it was getting late and went to Au chalet De mattionett where there was a huge cue a waitress was walking down the cue giving out menus and asked us if we had a priority card (something you can get if you have a disability or mental health condition) I said no she said follow me and took us to the front of the cue I thanked her very much (in French). The food is very expensive in the park so I would recommend taking your own food if you are on a budget .We had the meal plan plus which I would highly recommend . Lots of lovely food . Rides were great especially It's a small world after all . Due to lots of cueing we weren't able to see all of the park but did get to see Disney parade and Halloween parade and also on our last night we saw the spectacular fireworks  not to be missed !!!  brought a tear to my eye . We had an absolutely amazing time . Unforgettable ",1
Full days excitement at both Disney parks. Halloween party and fireworks were spectacular . Color light show at adventure park was just amazing .,1
"I looked for this review when planning this trip   This is for those people with older boys (11&14) as they have so many video games and tech at their finger tips. Disneyland is iconic for us in New Zealand, so it was pretty exciting to be there. And with the hopper pass to go between the two parks we ended up pretty happy after two days. However my 14 year old really only enjoyed limited rides here. The 11 year old was interested still in some of the younger rides, however after, it wasn't enough. I think if you had girls, there was lots more to keep them happy with fantasyland and all the dress up stuff. We made huge use of the fastpass system to book a time slot for later in the day to come back without the queues   anything over 30 mins wait we booked a fast pass and came back later. However between both parks we had enough to keep them happy and we would move between the two parks using our fastpasses. So yes, glad we did it, some great thrills (paradise rollercoaster and splash mountain rate for the 14year old) and it was a fantastic time however 2 days were enough. Disney cast members are amazing, they are always uplifting, happy and easy to deal with.",1
"Sunshine and fun to be had at every turn. There is plenty to do and see at Disneyland Park where you can find your favorite Disney Character. Park Hopper is a must if you want the opportunity to see everything on your own time frame. The Surf is a short 30 or 45 minute drive to the beaches where you have lots of options to choose from Laguna, Dana Point, Long Beach just to name a few. Every night Disneyland has fireworks and a light show   its worth a late evening trip to the park.",1
We arrived on the 19th of December till the 23rd . This was our 5th visit .The shows and parades were amazing .The first 2 days were quieter than the other 3 so we made the most of it you g on all of our favourite rides .and doing meet and greets .Customer service of all the staff in the parks was good . Both myself and my husband have green disabled passes and staff were very helpful .If you wish to visit princess pavilion you need to be there first thing to get a spot as they go early for the day . We only managed this on our last day to see Cinderella as it takes us longer to get ready and get anywhere .Will definitely be going back again .,1
"What can you say about Disneyland that hasn't been said? Leave your real world troubles behind, inhale the pixie dust, and let go!",1
The only thing that lets it down is the long queues. Other than that it is the true Disney experience. It is a little bit far from Paris for those who do not know Marne la Vall  e but access is relatively easy by train (R  seau Express Regional network). The food is obviously not going to be the best element given the audience targeted so best to bring your own.,1
We all had a great time while there. Would have liked to have been able to stay for an extra day but unfortunately we couldn't. If you don't like paying for overpriced food and water than bring your own. I know we will be doing this next time. $6.75 for a hot dog boggles the imagination.,1
Loved every minute of the two days were there. So glad we purchased the  hopper  pass that lets you move freely between California Adventure and Disneyland. Food was a little pricey but very good. Some lines were long but they kept you moving so it wasn't boring!,1
"We have been there many times now. I was 23 when I finally went my first time! My husband and I went as a poor, newly wed couple every time we passed it, having moved from Oregon to Phoenix & visiting home. Then, once back in Oregon we drove back once every other year, alternating with Victoria, B.C.. Once we had kids we went back (when they were 7,8 and 9) 5 times, 4 times within one year since we upgraded to a year's pass on our 2nd visit, to save big money on passes! Our eldest daughter loved it so much she made per college decision based in part on the college's proximity to Disneyland, Biola University, the college closest to Disneyland, and where she hopes to obtain an internship in two years. This year, she even won a year's pass to Disneyland from Biola University for writing a  What I did this past summer...  essay (tornado restoration in Oklahoma City) and she now visits every Friday, having purposefully scheduled NO classes on Friday! You can read all the pertinent details of Disneyland elsewhere, but here is a story of our family's LOVE of Disneyland.",1
"We were staying in a Disney hotel and got the park tickets included with our stay. Regardless of your age you can   t deny there is something magical about Disney, regardless of what Park you are in. We travelled to Disney the Thursday to Monday on the May Bank Holiday (Ireland).The park was busy but not Orlando busy most days, but Monday was by far the busiest day. There was bag checks and security on the way into both parks, which gave you peace of mind.I would recommend a trip to Disney Paris regardless of what your age, you won   t be disappointed.",1
3days in park from 9 am  11pm  absolutely brilliant but so exhusted would recommend staying for longer and doing shorter day fantastic time though .,1
"We went just a few days before Christmas and though it was definitely crowded, it was SO worth it! The park does such an amazing job of decorating Main Street, the castle and even some of the rides (Small World was absolutely amazing with Christmas lights, music and decor). I haven't been to Disneyland in over 20 years so California Adventure Park was new to me and we have two kids age 5 and 2.5 so we wanted to hit about every ride possible. The 3 day park hopper just wasn't enough time, I think we could have easily fit in another day with what we DIDN'T do. I would definitely take more time between Park days though, we did 3 days in a row and we were all just wrecked from 13 hours of walking around and standing in line etc. It was exhausting but so much fun. Can't wait for our next trip in a year or two! Next time I'd like to go when it's more off season and less crowded, but no regrets seeing it at Christmas time. With the fast passes and the  ride  app you can download on your phone to get real time wait times for rides, you won't ever need to wait more than 20 min or so in a ride line. And we did all the big rides (Space Mountain, Star Tours, Cali Screamin', Tower of Terror) multiple times.",1
"We had a wonderful time at the park, and since it was the first week of February, mid week, the crowds were VERY light. We were able to ride everything we wanted, even multiple times. I appreciated the wait times, Fast passes, and stroller passes   they make life easy for families with kids that can't or won't ride certain rides. The attention to detail on the costumes, shows, themed areas, decorations and rides (even in the line for the ride) is amazing and enhances the experience of being there! You are immersed into the ride experience! What a wonderful place to be with your family! ",1
Stayed at the Newport bay hotel in Euro Disney and the setting was magnificent. Food was excellent and not far to walk to the park. When the kids got tired there was a train on wheels to drop you off.,1
"Took our friends and 2 daughters to Disneyland and had a great time! We went on almost every ride in the park but multiple time on the fastest rides there. Space mountain, Thunder Mountain, Splash Mountain were our favorites.",1
"I've visited several times over the years with my own children, this time I took my 3 year old grandson who was in awe at everything! The best for him was the meeting of Mickey Mouse and Minnie but also his hero Spider Man.It's great but very tiring when your packing in so much, would still visit again and again!",1
Disneyland does not disappoint! We had the most amazing time here and would love to come back again! We spent a full day here 8am 10pm and we went on every ride we wanted to go on! We never spent more than 30 minutes in line using the fast passes  definitely look up the use of fast passes and use them as they save a lot of time! The Indiana jones ride and the haunted mansion were our favourite rides. Don't miss the firework show at night that was the highlight of the day  the most beautiful firework show we had ever seen with a beautiful view of the castle! This park does not disappoint However we could not spend more than one day here it is exhausting! One full day is all you need if your smart about it and utilise fast passes   don't spend all day in a line! A must do for anyone travelling to California! ,1
We had a great day as you would expect however they advertise rides for 3 years up   this is not the case.  I would nt go again until my kids are at least 5 years old....,1
"It's Disney, and Disney does things right!  Our daughter has a food allergy, and all food staff were knowledgeable and supportive of our unique needs.",1
"As good as any other Disney park elsewhere in the world. So if you're coming from LA or Orlando or Tokyo, you can give it a miss.",1
"Disney has it's own way to do things. Everything there is magic. You feel it on the parking lot. I stood in both parks and they're really nice. The only problem is that things are to expensive there. The souvenirs are really, really expensive. But you'll have a Magical Day. I loved!",1
"The whole place was mesmerizing to say the least. Be sure to queue up early as otherwise you will lose time while entering. It took us close to an hour to get in even though we had queued at the gates early. Before going make a plan as to which rides you want to take else you will keep waiting in the long queues. There are a few rides which are on everyone's list and no matter how much you plan you will have to wait in line. But for other rides you may have to wait only a few minutes. Whatever the wait is, it is worth every minute of your time.",1
We had the best day I have ever had at Disneyland. I have waited 45 years to see this place and YES it is MAGICAL. We went on most rides and watched the amazing street parade. Everyone should add Disneyland to their bucket list. It doesn't matter on your age as this is truly a magic place for everyone to visit.,1
"Three of us (all in the their early twenties) went to Disneyland Park on December 23. We did a road trip from SFO and took the PCH to enjoy the scenic beauty. And trust me, it was the best we had ever seen! Disneyland was awesome. Yes, awesome is the word. We had just one day at our disposal but we made full use of the time. We were inside the park at 9AM and came out at 11PM. I would like to mention the following points for youngsters planning to visit Disneyland with their friends:1.) Get some sleep the previous night or you are going to get tired very soon. The park is huge.2.) There is a concept of  fast pass  which allows you to take one fast pass for a ride and return to it at a specified time without having to stand in the queue. Make full use of this. It will save you lots of time for the most popular rides which could have a waiting time of upto 1 hour.3.) We liked  Space Mountain  the most. In fact we did it twice.  Indiana Jones  and  Space Mountain  are two of the best rides. Apart from the them,  Pirates of the Caribbean  and  Finding Nemo  are great too.4.) For Indians, do not get deterred by reviews which warn you of long queues! We are used to longer queues in Amusement Parks in India with more jostling and noise.5.) In the evening, you are bound to feel tired if you have taken most of the rides in the morning and afternoon. So, to relax yourself, you could take the boat ride and cruise. They will take away all your exhaustion while you enjoy the wonders of Disneyland.6.) CHristmas is the best time to visit with the resplendent colors and Christmas themed rides. The parade and fireworks are simply out of the world.",1
The castle is one of the most amazing parts of Disneyland. Enter the castle and walk around. Also find the dragon. It's amazing! This is the 2nd largest Disney Park in the world! You'll walk a lot.,1
"Have just returned from a 4'ish days trip, the parade and fireworks were wonderful as were the outside shows. Expected to queue and wasn't disappointed but fast pass not working on more than 1 ride! Some staff very vigilant on telling children (and adults) not to stand on railings etc but didn't see 1 person smoking outside of the designated areas challenged. approx 4 rides broke down as we were on them and some of them more than once as we went round. Some rides went way to fast so impossible to take in all that was on offer, Peter Pan, Snow White, Pinocchio in particular. I get it that there are queues etc but having queued for over 30mins Peter Pan took 5 mins if that!!Food outlets are expensive, lunch time was expensive and it all felt like fast food. Our evening meals were much better. Staff in the resturants we visited were very good especially with our smallest visitor who had a lot of questions!Please Disney think about putting some shade in the stage area, it was burning hot sunshine yesterday. It would also be good to be able to book time slots online for the most popular rides",1
All good as usual. Most we spent queuing was 40 mins and that was Peter Pan and it broke down while we waited.  Parade and fireworks were just worth the admission fee alone.,1
"Typical Disney, hasn't changes excessively since our first visit over 30 years ago. Still as busy, only much more expensive. If you don't have multi day tickets expect to pay almost $100 at the gate.",1
"I was lucky enough to take my grand daughter to visit Disney land. What a treat it was for both of us. The rides ranged from delightful to thrilling. We chose a good time to go as the queues weren't too horrific. Such a lovely clean, safe place with very helpful staff. ",1
"I only got to come here once growing up, and I always preferred the parks with big roller coasters over Disneyland. Now that I am older I can see the appeal of the happiest place on earth. They really put a ton of money into the park. The decorations are top notch, the place is spotless and it's always almost packed.There is only one place on earth really like it. You can't help but smile when you are walking around and seeing all the happy kids.",1
"Been here now for a number of times, we recently visited again a few days before Halloween which turned out to be fright night, so the park closed at 6pm to the public and then was open to fright night ticket holders only. Which was fine as we were pre warned at ticket booth. However, what they forgot to tell you was that those guest were arriving from 5, so the park got very busy. Queues were great, didn't have to queue till 5 anyway. Got on space mountain 3 times, excellent ride! Loved the ghost these they did too. Also got to repeat several other fave rides too as no queues. Shame small world was closed though as annoying the ride is, it makes disney for the kids. Also not sure what happened to the parade, it was over before we blinked. Usually they go on for about 20 mins. We thought we would get a quick cheeky ride on space mountain while crowds were waiting for it yo begin. But by time our ride was done (queued for about 5 mins) the parade was no where to be seen, crowds moved off, really odd. And no princesses or princes to be seen either. Did get to see mickey, Minnie and Pluto :)Overall, had a great day, Shane park closed early, would have liked to seen fireworks.",1
i can safely say that its good to be here during october where there is not much people waiting in line:P you have to be in shape for the ong walks though:P its a fun filled experience for kids and adults especially we say the Glow in the Park parade:P,1
Newly built facilities and familiar cartoon characters make beautiful backdrops for photo opportunities with you and your partner. Payment don't stop at the door so be ready to continue paying inside.,1
Best trip ever! It all started at the Grand California with one of the best customer service moves ever. I recently broke my leg and was expecting on renting a wheelchair. I ran into on of my old friends who worked at valet. After catching up for about a half hour I politely asked if they had wheelchairs so I didn   t have to walk to the whole way to the park. In a blink of an eye he went back to the back room and pulled one out for me. I had a fully automatic wheelchair for the park. Disney   s cast and crew were extremely accommodating in regards to the chair. Saved the trip!,1
"Great park. We easily rode did everything we wanted in one day and went back for a few hours during mid day for a second day for our favorite rides and shows. Mickey and the Wonderous Book is my all time favorite Disney show. I just wish the castle wasn't under construction, but I'll just have to go to see the new one when completed. ",1
"Known for its smaller size in comparison to other disneyland parks, Hong Kong Disneyland however has the merits of easy reach from the city centre and a shorter waiting time for various attractions in the park.   In fact, though a local resident, I have strong...More",1
"try buying your ticket in china travel, terminal1 airport they're cheaper. buy the 2day pass so you won't be rushed and see everything. food isn't good eat outside before coming.bring water its expensive there. see the 3 shows and the parade and the fireworks. dont miss mystic mountain it looks like a haunted house but is actually a ride. the new sections are toy story and grizzly gulch. lots of photo ops. see the spinning statue in the museum in front its great. if you dont want to get rattled dont ride the roller coaster inside the mountain, its very fast.when you get down its like being drunk.",1
"I heard that the lines are less here comparing to Tokyo or US... however a few days before Christmas on a beautiful clear winters day proves this wrong. It was still busy! The rumours are correct it's very small, but not terribly. You only need a day to get around and at least you feel like you have seen it all. As always the food isn't great so bring a few snacks with you! ",1
"I just visited DLP 4 days 3 nights Nov 13 16     Children age 8 & 5 yrs. Contrary to some very negative reviews     we seem to have enjoyed the park and find the deal worth the money.Some tips for the Budget Traveler : ( Previous reviews helped me a lot to plan my trip)As mentioned by some travelers     disagree that Disney is trying to fleece. Food is allowed into the parks. Val D Europe a shopping mall is located nearby(8 mins ride). There is ligne(line)   50 shuttling from Disney bus stop     have to get down at hotel Elyssees stop     walk a bit forward and look to the left u will find one entrance of the mall. Forward into the mall you will not miss Auchan supermarket on the left where you get everything     water, breads, ham, Vine etc. Walk further down the mall straight you find the food court where you get all foods at reasonable rates.Only note line 50 timings are a bit not regular     but if you time the travel to and back you will waste very little time. Below are the current timings of the line 50 from Disney stop     8.53,9.30,10.00,11.40,14.40,15.10,15.52,17.02,18.05,18.35,19.05,19.36,20.05,20.30,20.55,21.20 the line is free if you are staying in a Disney group hotel     just keep the hotel identity card.There is McDonalds in Disney village     opposite the parks where you can grab a quick burger at regular rates and be back in the park.The restaurants in the Park and Village are highly priced but I saw them all fully occupied. The Disney merchandise are heavily priced and the Disney stores in Val D Europe and Champs Elysee sell at the same rate     so might as well buy from the parks. However I saw some Disney merchandise on sale in Auchan     Val D Europe at regular rates.Opinion on RidesRides in Disney Studios were worth it     1) Crush   s Coaster as the 5 yr old could do it we did it 5 times though the ride stopped in between due to malfunction(scary @) 2) Stitch live     did 2 times Children enjoyed and we appreciated the technology 3) Twilight Zone     did 2 times 3rd time the ride broke down 4) Car Show     don   t miss it, 5) Armageddon     OK, 6) Toy Story Area     avoid it     the Parachute ride is very slow ie the Q is very small but it takes very long time to reach the ride and the ride seemed to be boring.Rides in Disney Park : Most rides were outdated     the few new ones seem to be good 1) Buzz light year     did it 3 times was entertaining for the 5 yr old and all 2) Space Mountain     both my Children below height level min 1.50m? but heard it is the best ride in the park 3) Star tours     try it once     but feel it is an 80   s ride. 4) Peter Pan and Pirates of Carribbean     it could not entertain even a 5 yr old. Hope Disney realizes we are in the Digital 4 D era and they should not be using hydraulic operated puppets any more. 5) BigThunder Mountain     normal roller coaster ride with a themeHope Disney would go for Digital 3D Visual effects etc. in our lifetime. The parades and shows were fabulous(made my day!)     if possible try not to miss the parades and shows     refer to program timings sheet at the entrance to the parks     if in doubt check with information staff     they are trained to answer you     even if some are hesitant.The characters were so real and seemed to have just jumped out of the movies. They performed so well that I think my children will remain their loyal subjects for life.Saw the Buffalo Bill Wild West Show     see it only if you interested in the history of the show(I read it was a 100 year old show). It cost me around $ 300   for a front seat(net of 20% discount on pre booking), but noticed that as there were no sufficient crowd everybody was seated in front rows. The second row seats cost only around $220   (for family with 2 children)and have the same dinner menu as the rest. Even back rowsgive a good view plus less exposure to the saw dust kicked up by the horses and cattle(your dresses smell cattle & horse once you are out). So I suggest take the 2nd rows only as it is worth the money including the dinner     unlimited beer and excellent meat( 2 big ribs and big leg of chicken     I could not finish it) served in traditional cast iron tawa. Plus there is a small entertainment before the show and Mickey Minnie  Goofywere there and provided ample photo opportunity     report 1 hr before the show.( ) ves1) The park was well kept and clean2) Staff were very friendly     after reading some reviews expected the staff to be rude especially to Asians.However obviously they have been trained to be polite.3) The Qs seemed to be reasonable     though on Sat & Sun it was a bit more. 40 mins for one time forCrush   s coaster was the max we experienced.4) The Parades and shows were fabulous     obviously lot of hard work has gone into it.( ) ves1) The rides in Disney Park seem to be outdated (as compared to Disney Studios). Hope Disney comes up with new technology.2) Disney Merchandise heavily priced3) Some characters were a bit discriminatory     Mr Incredible declined my daughter an autograph while he obliged for all the white children(Is he racist : ?!     one less character she is subject to). But others made up for it     Goofy, Mickey, Minney, the Chipmunks. My son could   nt get to Ratoutile     he was in a hurry.However Buzz lightyear(his favorite) obliged him     I ended up buying much Buzz LY merchandise.",1
"The park was dressed up for Halloween , amazing pumpkins everywhere carved at the favourite Disney character, the best was to see the park is start early and fast pass everything .  If you have No kids under 8 avoid fantasyland till affterdark as this...More",1
"I love Disneyland, yet I haven't been in years until this April. The ticket prices are pretty steep, but if you live locally or know someone who lives locally, get an annual pass. It's definitely worth it. Long story short, there are a lot of rides, lots of little attractions, and let's not forget: Detail, detail, detail. That's what makes Disneyland so much more magical. The shopping is great for Disney Souvenirs, and even greater shopping in Downtown Disney. The food is pretty reasonable considering it's Disneyland; However, I'd probably stay away from all of the nice restaurants there; They tend to be not so great in my opinion (With the exception of Steakhouse 51, I believe it's called?) Take a trip if you haven't been or even if you haven't been in a year. They're always finding ways to make Disneyland more magical.",1
The rides were great but the crowds were ridiculous! I waited for 60 minutes for some rides. The food on offer is not the healthiest. Otherwise it was great fun.,1
"We took the subway to HK Disney which is very convenient and inexpensive. Before the entrance is a big fountain with characters on it, like Mickey on a surfboard moving up & down. We knew we could get tickets at any 7 11 and other various places, but they told us we would have to exchange the receipt for tickets at the park, so we opted to get the tickets at the park, that was a mistake. the ticket line was one of the longest we encountered there, on the other hand exchanging a receipt for tickets could be done at any kiosk, most of which were unoccupied. Speaking of tickets the price is a good bit lower than the parks in the USA, especially if you happen to be a senior (65 or over) where the price come to about $14 US for a day, almost makes the long trip worth it. There are seven areas: Main Street, Fantasyland, Adventureland, Tomorrowland, Grizzly Gulch (HK version of Frontierland), Mystic Point (a land formed around Mystic Manor a unique attraction that replaces Haunted Mansion), and Toy Story Land. Our first stop was Grisly Gulch to ride Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars, the park's version of Big Thunder Mountain Railroad, but there are more animatronic figures and at one point it goes backward. Nearby is Mystic Manor, even though it doesn't have a fast pass, it must be considered it the high point of the park, the story concerns a mischievous money who steal an ancient amulet which brings things to life, some are rendered with animatronics, many are projections on walls, overall extremely effective. We also visited the nearby Mystic gardens which has some cool sculptures configured as puzzles. Toy Story Land has giant figures based on the film and a few standard rides repurposed to match the theme. We rode the Toy Soldier Parachute Drop just like drop rides and many other amusement parks. While we were there we saw green army men practicing a drill, and barking orders in English. We then attended a Broadway style show The Golden Mickey's Presented in Disney   s Storybook Theater. This is an OK show with lots of singing and dancing. Except for the entrance area, Small World is just like the Cal  counterpart incl  the stylized figures from Disney films. Jungle Cruise is definitely advanced over the ones in the USA, there are some new figures, underwater explosions, fire and a part with a projection of crawling bugs we had the option to ride with the pilot speaking English. Nearby was Leaky Tikki, a series of Tikki statues which shoot water, a welcome relief on a hot day. Festival of Lion King is a stripped down version of the stage show at WDW. Mickey Philharmagic s just like the one at WDW, including being in English. The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh is basically the same unimpressive version that is in Disneyland. The night brought two shows Disney Paint the Night which is their version of Main Street electrical Parade, with lots of programmed lights which allow costumes to change colors and even display changing patterns, there were truly some amazing displays. And the worthwhile finale    Disney In The Stars    Fireworks a spectacular show featuring pyrotechnics shot from ,many locations around you, and projections on the castle. One of the most impressive fireworks shows I've ever seen. I guess that shouldn't be too surprising as the Chinese invented fireworks. Since the end of the fireworks coincided with closing time I thought the subway would be unbearable, but it wasn't overly crowded.",1
"This is the second time I came to Hong Kong Disneyland and this time I can feel so excited because the first time I came here, it was raining and I can not play anything.",1
"Went here in December, so it was not hot, but it was not too cold either. We pre purchased the ticket from our hotel so we didn't have to line up, got there 15 minutes after the park was open.We managed to go on 2 rides in the space of 30 minutes, but after that we had to wait for at least 30 minutes sometimes 50 minutes to go on a ride.Disneyland Hongkong is very suitable for young children, I think there are only 2 3 rides with height restriction, you can also hire a stroller there so you don't have to bring your own.Just a little tip, if you don't mind missing the parade, I'd recommend you to go on the rides during parade time, because most people would be watching the parade and the rides would be empty.",1
"What can I say its disneyland.  So much fun, so big I wanna go back already!!!! Its the happiest place on earth",1
Whole experience was very magical for the whole family. Highlight was the night time show and the parade. Not enough seating areas. Food & beverages is very pricey.,1
It is indeed for the family. It brings out the child in you. It is worth the time and money. It could have been more wonderful if we don't have to walk too far from the parking going inside because just walking that distance is effort already. The energy could have been used visiting every attraction. One day isn't enough,1
"With two exclusive lands, Grizzly Gulch and Mystic Point, there is something new discover even for the most experienced Disneyland visitor.And what   s even more exciting is the latest addition of the world   s first interactive Disney light parade, the Disney Paint the Sky Parade. This amazing parade allows visitors to become a part of the parade by changing the colours of the scenes with their    Mickey Magic Paint Brush   . The magical paint brush can also activate hidden    Magical Art    pieces throughout the park during the day, so it   s definitely worth purchasing one to experience all the Disney magic.Check out our travel blog for more photos:http:  www.wanderlustchronicles.com.au  !Hong Kong Disneyland c235k 82F26891 6CFF 432F A9F0 9F53999B857B",1
Magical to say the least. Five stars but only because I couldn   t give the smaller brother next door eight out of five.Utterly enchanting and exceptionally value for money in my opinion. Mid August but queues were as expected. Not to that long to be fair. The fireworks and light show were the be all to end all. We went the last night as we didn   t need to return for magic time the following morning and I can honestly say that I have never been so mesmerised by a display.I   m struggling to find superlatives for this place so can only imagine what   s going through my daughter   s thoughts.Went to Florida many years before but don   t feel the need with this fascinating venue just over the channel.I can guarantee that    WE WILL BE RETURNING   !!!,1
"We had so much fun at Disneyland! Early entry through our hotel was key   we were in line by 6;30 each morning for a 7am opening and that was good. It also helps to have a plan   and the App   mapped out so that you can most effectively use your time. If you have little kids, an autograph book that the characters can sign is a fun thing for them to have. I recommend waiting until your youngest child is at least age 4 and 40  tall   we did almost everything with our 4yo son, and the rides that required over 40  were too scary for him anyway.",1
"We were able to meet lots of characters for photos, the fireworks were amazing, Disney staff very attentive, great shopping, good rides queues not as long as Orlando park.",1
"No matter how old we are, time at Disneyland makes you feel like a kid again!!  I enjoyed myself so much I cannot wait to go back!!!",1
"My daughter and I have been to DisneyWorld and Disneyland too many times to count. Since we were in Paris, we wanted to see what the Disneyland Paris park was like. We took the RER train which was located in the metro right in front of the Opera Garnier. I would recommend purchasing roundtrip tickets at the information booth. Follow the signs to make sure you take the correct train. Your ending point is Marne la Vallee Chessy. It will be a 40 minute train trip and the stop puts you right by Disneyland. We purchased the Disney tickets online before we left for the trip. I believe both parks cost $62 each. We first went to Walt Disney Studios and was shocked as to how small it is. Since we read the reviews about Crush's Coaster, we went there first and stood in line for 50 minutes. People raved about the ride but when we walked out we had no clue why people liked it. For the first 10 seconds, there is animation about the undersea life and then everything is dark and it is a rollercoaster ride for the rest of the time. It is definitely not worth the wait in line. We took the Studio Tram Tour which is similar to the Backstage Lot at Disney. I really liked the French version which had a French English story about a traveler losing his cellphone and ends up in all these movies. Cinemagique was for a younger audience. Several of the restaurants at both parks were closed which I found to be very odd. We had a salad in the entrance. At the main park, we went to Indiana Jones and the Temple of Peril. It was disappointing to find out that it is a roller coaster and at the end does a complete tight 360. Pirates of the Caribbean was closed. It is good to check online which rides are closed. The Phantom Manor was much the same as the one in Disney as was Big Thunder Mountain. It's a Small World is much better in Paris than in the U.S. Star Tours and Buzz Lightyear were about the same as the ones in the U.S. Space Mountain was much more adventuresome than the one at DisneyWorld. I can tolerate the one there but not being a fan of roller coasters I thought this one was too much for me. The happy go lucky and cheery feeling just wasn't evident at this park. In the U.S. the employees are fun, greet people and seem like Disney ambassadors. There are no 1st time, birthday buttons either which I think is a great touch. I am glad I went once but I wouldn't be interested in going back. We went on a Thursday and at the main park we waited about 5 15 minutes for each ride.",1
"A school holiday treat for my 5 years old Son and he had a blast today the only set back was my Son was exhausted by 4pm, I had a blast too..",1
"Spent August 7, 2016 with my son, his girlfriend, and one of his co workers at Disneyland. This was truly a magical day. A little planning went into the day, thanks to my son. We learned of the fast pass system and how it worked, THIS IS KEY!!! We also had the disneyland app downloaded to help us navigate and know how long the lines were. We also used the app to filter out rides for adults. Overall we had a plan of attack, read websites on what to bring (sunscreen, food (we stopped at a local grocery store and got sandwich wraps, granola bars, nuts, and veggie straws), water, a cellphone battery pack, and a regular camera so we didn't have to use our cellphones all the time). They did check our bags and allowed our food in....so do this if you can, it really saves on money. We were able to hit all the rides we wanted, saw the parade and the fireworks. I was a great day filled with great memories. P.S. WEAR COMFY SHOES!!!!!",1
"This was our second return to Disneyland Paris, as it's the only one in Europe it's easy to book an escape for a few days. We had tickets for 2 days, first day we used the car park, and there was ample of it, and the second day we took the bus from our hotel room and was dropped off at the entrance the Disney village. Lots of activities for all ages, some queues had a longer wait than 60 minutes and with young kids they don't have the patient to wait that's why the 2 day pass was fantastic as it enabled us do it all specifically the more popular ones we did at park closure time and before the firework show, but if you have a one day pass strongly recommend to buy a fast pass which we will do in the future. The kids favourite was Pirates of the Caribbean and It's a small world, which they did twice. To eat at one the themed restaurants highly recommend booking in advance perhaps 48 hours before, we missed out so just had to eat at one of the local takeaways cafes, it's hard to find a sitting spot for a family of 5. Food, drinks and souvenirs are quite expensive, if you're on a budget might consider to nominate an item or 2, but if it's a lifetime adventure go and spend, there are heaps of shops around even in the Disney village which has a no entrance fee. Clothing is very expensive and the quality is not so great. Customer service was excellent I didn't realise until we got to Paris that my ticket dates did not coincide with my hotel dates so the Customer Service was happy to change the dates that suited without a fee   very happy.We didn't do the Walt Park as their rides weren't suitable for all of our children due to height restrictions so before you book tickets perhaps check those regulations to avoid disappointment. The park and amenities were clean. ",1
"Disneyland on the whole may not be able to compete with Disney World, but the Disneyland Park on its own is definitively the best of park out there. For those familiar with Disney's Magic Kingdom, only the minute Disneyland Castle fails to live up to the younger brother, and it has its own classic charm anyhow. The park has more or less everything the Magic Kingdom has to offer, plus a wealth of other treasures such as Indiana Jones, Alice in Wonderland, Mr. Toad's Wild Ride and the Matterhorn.",1
"Walkiing down the middle of mainstreet USA is just magical. It is a feast for all of your senses. You can't help but have a smiile on your face and you enjoy every single minute at Disneyland. The rides are all wonderful and the parades are second to none! The nighttime Fantasmic show is just spectacular. The food is wonderful as well. I could go on and on, but I will stop with: YOU MUST GO TO DISNEYLAND and take the entire family. The memories you will make will be priceless, believe me!",1
"Very clean,entertaining,fun for the whole family.  Can be tiring for little ones.  During peak season and hours long line ups,need lots of water.",1
I've been going to Disneyland my whole life and I can't get enough of it.  It's a great place to visit.  If you haven't been try to go during the fall or winter when the lines are shorter.  Summer was crazy.,1
"My Son really enjoy Disneyland, even till today he still telling me about Mickey, Minnie, Donald and daisy. A great place for family",1
Was great but hard to get to as the walk from the car park is a long way. It has travelators but they didn't go to the park. The park it's self is great the kids loved the rides. My daughter did princess for a day and Princess lunch. She was made up to meet cinderella. The weather was great. ,1
loved every minute of it the rides are good here but not as good as walts park but amazing restaurants and shopping and views,1
"Well though i must admit that i was old to be in a place like disney but never the more i became(in thoughts) a kid and enjoyed it so much. Loved each bit of it.. the rides the show , the parade all were great!!",1
"Disneyland Park was magic from start to finish.We loved every moment of it from the queues to the rides and everything in between. Listen, there were loads of queues, of course there were!! No surprise at all! It was hot and I spent a fortune on drinks and snacks, of course I did!! No surprise at all. Loved being in the magic of Disney and will definitely return.One thing... we stayed at the hotel Cheyenne, as part of this we got magic hour passes: 2 hours on the parks ahead of day guests. Well two things here, nothing opened until 8.30, so max we got 1hr 30mins and when the park finally opened not all the rides were open. This was a poor start to the day however we soon forgot about it (we   ll, until the next day when we had to wait to get doing again!!!)Happy to recommend for families with boys aged 8yo and 6yo and mums and dads who still believe in the magic!!",1
"California Adventure Park had awesome ride my 3 year old loved the cars ride unfortunately since the wait time is 2 3 hours. Make sure to be there at park opening and get a fast pass. Note fast passes go fast so go right away get one, go on ride and go get another one. Loved all the rides there. Went to Disneyworld last year just to the Magic Kingdom and I hate to say I was very dissapointed and thought who where these rides supposed to appeal too. Travelled with my mom and my 3 year old so wide age range. Adventure Park was awesome.",1
"Third time this year and hopefully going again after Christmas!! amazing days and nights. The rides, the shows, the parades, the food, the fireworks WOW! Cannot fault it. Great time to go in October we managed to do the top rides at least twice. Very quiet round the park and food outlets.Can't wait til next time!!",1
I have been going since 1959! It just gets better and better! The rides are fantastic to ride on no matter what age you are. I took my daughter for 5 years in a row. My dad took me and my sisters for years. Now that I am retired I am going back again! It is the happiest place on earth and very clean. The staff are all so respectful and kind. I will love it for ever. I went in February but can't wait to go in the summer of 2015.,1
"This is a classic park but that doesn't mean that it is old fashioned. The magic of Disneyland lives on. The cast members are wonderful and everyone just seems that much nicer to everyone else. Rides are engaging and enchanting no matter what age, and there are enough 'thrill' rides to keep even the most cynical happy. Such a wonderful place!",1
"This was our first family experience of Disneyland, and whilst good was probably not comparable with the US parks. I'm saying this as it was easily covered in a day. For the younger kids it's great, but post 6 or 7 the rides are limited. That said, we still had a great day and the ambience is magical. My son is 8 going on 9 and loved the day. The rides are clean and the place is well staffed. The park was packed when we attended as it was the day after a public holiday, and the heat was oppressive. But we still had a great but very tiring day. Having been to Ocean Park, for older kids and whilst it's not as polished as Disney, it has bigger rides that will better suit them. ",1
"You know exactly what your getting with Disney and as usual it delivered. Spotless Park, rides a plenty, colourful parades and shows. Characters to meet and topped off at the end of the day by a Fireworks n animation show that can only be topped by their next production. ",1
"I didn't expect to like Disneyland as much as I did, but... It was actually amazing! The decor is beautiful and transports you to the magical world of Disney cartoons. Apart from the whimsical characters and all the strollers everywhere, there are the rides. We...More",1
A great way to fill a day but the fast track tickets run out really fast so get the ones you want first. The food and drinks are expensive. We took our own water in with us. We saw Spiderman and captain America who were very nice and took the time to talk to everyone and did not rush people away.,1
"Everybody knows Disneyland is a wonderful place for kids. I will tell you how to enjoy more and get the most out of your trip to Disney. I am writing about the Disneyland in Paris also called Euro Disney. If you are a first time visitor go the Disney Park, instead of Disney studio, you would definetely enjoy more. Disney would be less fun, if you do not have a kid with you. Your fun would be maximised on seeing the expressions on the face of the kid who could see all his her fairy tales come alive. Disney makes you walk a lot, so have a good sleep on the previous day and have a good breakfast for you and the kid(s). Do not try to finish the rides hastily. Do it patiently, believe me, there would be enough time in the day to complete rides to your satisfaction. Do not miss the last parade at 8 pm. If you miss the parade you have not seen what Disney is all about. Have a happy trip !",1
Great fun for all the family even older people and those with disabilities or in a wheelchair (I had very good service always going to the front of the queue) People do try to queue jump or even tried to tag on to our family party of 9 so they could get in first.The rides are suitable for all ages and our family had great fun. Because we stayed in the Disneyland hotel we had extra fast passes which avoids queuing. You need to be prepared for the wait. The shows were of an excellent standard. It is a very busy place and if you don't like crowds then proceed with caution!,1
"Yes you are right, I like Disneyland... : ) During the last 12 years my wife and I have visited the Disneyland park 10 times. The last time was in October 2005 when we celebrated our 10th wedding anniversary there. We used to live in Orange County, but we now reside in Australia. I wish I could visit Disneyland every holiday!We now have a little two year old girl and we can't wait to take her there. Every time we visited Disneyland it is better than before and never disappointed. Here on earth nothing is perfect, but I think the folks at Disneyland do an AMAZING job to entertain you.If you are wondering if you should go...GO! You will absolutely love it!",1
"First time at the park and after reading reviews I was prepared for the worst. But it was great! No lines at entrance, very polite staff, everyone spoke English, the princesses, mickey mouse, the rides were soo much fun! Yes you have to que for up to an hour for famous rides but if you plan your day using the DLP app it's perfect! We did all the rides, shows, parades and the magical illumination show at front row! It can be Done in a day if planned for one park only, we chose disneyland park. Also the water fountains don't work so prepare to pay 4 euro for a bottle of water and 4 euro for hot drinks. Will visit disney world in Orlando next!All the best!",1
Yes its old. Yes it's crowded. Yes it's expensive. But at the end of the day it's Disneyland. The smiles the park everything about it creates life long memories. Absolutely love it,1
"A quarter of a century ago I took my young family to Disneyland.....and loved it.In 2011 my wife and I, believing that Disneyland was built for adults and kids just happen to love it too, went back by ourselves......and loved it.Last month, I took my family back again, but this time there were 3 generations of us.......and we all loved it.Living on the other side of the world poses problems, but I hope I can live long enough for there to be a 4th visit and I don't care if they have to push me in there in a wheelchair......if I get the chance again, I'll be there.",1
"Our visit in Disneyland was perfect!There were not that many tourists so the lines at the attractions didn't take long.The park was huge, but you can see all the attractions in a day if you don't go during peak season.The rides are family friends and none are too extreme.I loved this park and will definitely visit again. :)",1
This place is fantastic!! All childhood favourites and recent addition makes this place a great holiday destination for children and adults. Lines can be long (its Disneyland after all) but if the fast passes are utilised properly then there will be enough time for all your favourite rides.,1
We had an amazing week at Disneyland. I can't think of a single thing worth complaining about.  My husband had to get an ecv and the cast members were more than accomidating.,1
"Excellent! Amazing! Clean! So much fun!! Advice: Get the fast pass and use it!!! Make dinner reservations at least a week before you go. Get a pass that allows you to go from one park to the next. Wait until you   re leaving the park before you buy souvenirs   you may decide you really don   t want them, and you won   t have to carry them around all day. Take up to 4 days if you can   we only had one. Charge all your phones   so great for communication if you split up and for safety. Read up before you go. Learn about what   s offered, and make a flexible itinerary. ",1
"I am self confessed disney addict. I strongly believe that in Disneyland do you leave today and enter the world of yesterday, tomorrow and fantasy. The cons first and there aren't too many:1. The park is really small compared to the other parks. A strip down version can be completed in one day (not including all the rides) and a full exploration can be completed in two days.2. The food quality differs substantially across the park, I tried food at a fair few places and I liked the bakery at the main street the most, I think I had a chicken and mushroom quiche at the bakery and it was lovely.Now the real thing. I loved Disneyland HK, there is a dedicated line to park and it is called Sunnybay (What a lovely name, right?!). We did pretty much everything in one day. Our itinerary was as follows:1. Caught the Mickey's Philharmonic at 11.30am,2. Collected fast pass for the Winnie the Pooh ride and Space Mountain at 12 for fast pass entry at 3.30 4.45 for both the rides.Most people who have visited Disneyland know the concept of fast pass, but I will explain it here for those who don't. All Disneylands have fast pass for their most popular rides. You must retain your park pass and go to a fast pass machine (always installed at the premises of the fast pass machines) to collect this pass. Your fast pass will tell you a range of time (mostly 45 minutes) like from 3.30 4.15 pm, you just have to retain this pass and come to the ride between this time and you get to avoid the queue! There is a separate line for the fast pass holders. For the ease of reference all the park maps will have fast pass rides will be denoted with an FP.3. Caught the Golden Mickey's show at 12.45am4. Caught lunch and it was quite a task and then went to the Jungle ride, which made us wait for quite a while.5. Went for the Its a small world ride (adorable thing!) at 1.30 pm at the time flight of fantasy parade. Now, this is important and we realised it only after visiting the park. There are two flights of fantasy parade (I don't know the timing correctly), since most of the crowd is interested in the parade it is a very good idea to use the timings for one of the parades to track the crowded rides such as the Carousel, Jungle Ride, Its a small world. We used this time for that.6. Went for the Jungle ride after it (so cute!)7. Went for the Winnie the Pooh and Space Mountain rides8. Went for the second flight of the fantasy parade. 9. Caught the Festival of Lion King at 6 pm.I hope this helps and it. I loved it. So very amazing and I will definitely go back again!",1
"Hongkong Disneyland is a excellent in all field.whole day activity, with full fun & masti.all rides are enjoyable,every age of group must ride, in last FIRE SHOW is fantastic ...unbelievable... so big.it is best for all age of group. one thing i want to say in Disneyland it is so costly food .. water.. everything... so plz take with you these things from outside.",1
"We travelled from Australia to California to tick Disneyland   California Adventure Park off our  must do once in our lifetime  list & were not disappointed. Although not a lot of big thrill rides there is so much other stuff to do. The attention to detail is amazing, the staff were friendly & helpful and the shows of a high standard. We went in mid January & we hardly waited in queues at all & walked straight onto a lot of the smaller rides. Based on our 4 day experience (2 days in each park) we suggest you go on the Cars Ride, Space Mountain, Soaring Over California & Toy Story at least once although everyone enjoys different rides. If you have a younger child go to the Jedi Training Academy (we have an 11 & 8 year old) & don't miss The World of Colour, the fireworks & parade. Being new the Cars ride had the longest queue times so as we had access to the extra magic hour (we stayed at the Disneyland Hotel & we could get into alternate parks an hour earlier each morning) we went straight there & it only took 20 minutes. One slight downside was that food was not great & a bit expensive. As you can tell we had a great time & loved it & can now tick this off our bucket list!!!!",1
"I assume its smaller than the one in Tokyo. Tried a few rides, not too extreme. The rain causing the parade to be cancelled, dissapointed but it was okay. Last minute to ride before the park closed. Can be expensive, but it was okay..",1
"THE reason we visited Hong Kong and we were so glad to do so. Compared to the Flordia, California and even Tokyo DL this one is smaller but nevertheless the fun was unlimited. The property was very well maintained, directions were as usual pretty good. One weird thing was some shows were in Chinese which we found funny (no pun intended) as we were alien to the language and more than that the lines were coming out from Mickey and company. The Halloween parade was awesome and so were the Halloween themed fireworks (we went in October). We had a great time and will not loose an opportunity of visiting again. And best part was the connectivity to MTR   great planning!",1
"For people in India who cannot travel to California to see the very first Disney park, Paris would be the ideal place and you would probably find more adults enjoying the park then the kids. It takes more then a day for you to cover the park ... So it a must see if one visits Paris ....",1
"We are planning our fourth trip to California and absolutely love the parks.We last visited in August 08 , the weather was fantastic and we didnt have to queue for very long at all for the rides.Would recommend the parades,fireworks are fabulous. Worth saving all year for a trip to California.We cant decide whether or not to try December or go back in August again.A bit concerned the queues may be long near Christmas.",1
"It was great and our kids loved it although they're 14 and 15 but in reality this place is targeting a younger audience. You'll need 2 days there, not because of the size of the park but because of the queues. Bring a packed lunch, again because of the queues. And we were there on a Monday outside the school holidays! The rides are mild and mostly for little ones. There are also queues to take photos with the characters and the characters are scattered all over the park. Bring good shoes and loads of patience!",1
"When we think of Disney we think of Disneyland as the timeless place. We live in New England but have traveled to this place many times, as a matter of fact on our honeymoon 40 years ago so we returned and were not disappointed. So many of our favorites are still there and there is so much that is fresh and new and more is on the way. Our next trip will be with Grandchildren who's parents met Mickey for the first time here. Disneyland is and institution bring anyone who wants to be happy and smile!",1
"If you've been to Disney before, you know what to expect, this is a really well executed theme park.",1
"Visited on a whim over a 4 day weekend that my wife and I happened to have. We used 3 day hopper passes and took our 4 year old son. We didn't check what was going on at the parks before we decided go, and it happened to be Star Wars Half Marathon weekend. It was very crowded, but we still managed to do just about all of the rides. It was our son's first time visiting, and he had a really good time. He thoroughly enjoyed Radiator Springs, and all of the Cars characters. We appreciate that Disney allows you to bring in your own snacks, rather than requiring you to buy food once you're in the park.",1
"Brilliant, from setting off from Causeway Bay to arriving at Disneyland. Last part of journey was on the Disney train.Not as busy as Florida's Disneyworld so more chance of going on all the rides when you want to.Has a lot of the razzamataz of Disneyworld.We have visited on two occasions, and enjoyed both equally. Try it, you won't be disappointed.",1
"As a 20 year old I would say that Disneyland Paris is slightly overrated, but I'm sure it's not for children! Definitely worth going as a family day out. I went with my boyfriend for the day, and we did have a really nice time, apart from the disaster that we realised we had to buy a separate expensive ticket to get into Disney Studios (which has most of the good rides, i think). The fireworks display and projections at the end of the night is by far the best part, it's unlike anything I've ever seen before   so magical!",1
"It Must to be visited and we got 2 days tickets to cover all of the zones as price was good almost 20% off , although weather was indeed very humid but we had a lot of fun , make sure you get the booklet...More",1
We came with 3 boys 11 to 17. All were totally excited and thrilled.In the middle of a December week the park was very relaxed and there were no queues. The kids could go on the rides again and again as they wished. It was amazing.The park is beautiful and well organized. The final show is wonderful.The souvenir shops are terribly expensive. We took the RER train from Le Halles. Simple and convenient. No need to book transport in advance.,1
"Yes, it's pricey but Dreams have no price tag. I'll share tips to make this affordable. Every kid deserves to visit DL once & every adult must visit DL to become a child again.Why to visit Disneyland hong Kong ?Probably the least expensive of all ( as per my understanding )Westernised, though in ChinaLovely staffMagical interaction with every character.I will emphasize on   LOVELY STAFF  again.. I'm 27 year old & staff played a very important role in making me happy. From getting me first wagon of every roller coaster to personalised meetings with the character to going out of the way only to get me polybags to carry my souveniers, Staff played a vital role. Thank you.Parades are beautiful.Rides are great !!And being the smallest DL, you have to walk a lot less compared to others.Absolutely least or NO Queues at all. Call me Lucky maybe :PWhy not to visit DisneyLand Hong Kong?If you don't care about Disneyland. Or you're quiet short on your visit.USEFUL TIPS   HACKS :Reach by 0930 at the gates, you'll be the first one to hop in.Do ask present staff at every ride for the first wagon, they will definitely agree if you're polite (at the most they will ask you to wait for the next ride).You can make your visit affordable by carrying snacks which are sealed & a water bottle too.Best rides ? Hyperspace Mountain ( Definitely for Star Wars fans & adults ); it's a small World, Mystic Manor, River Cruise ( for kids ); Iron Man Experience & Big Grizzly Runaway Mine cars ( every age )DO NOT MISS NIGHT PARADE.And If you wish to meet IRON MAN, go to Iron Man Tech Showcase ( Most people didn't know about this)CONCLUSION:Yes, I will visit again. And will definitely recommend the same to others.",1
"I have been torn about going to Disney for years, I just couldn't believe it was really worth the money, but when we found our family with the opportunity to go, it had to happen.Although I myself was not too excited, my kids, 7, 10, 12 were very excited, and I must say, Disney did not fail to deliver. We all had an amazing trip. Disney is so clever in the way they put together the park, it is beautifully crafted and constructed. There are enough thrills to keep the adventure seekers happy but the attention to detail at every turn is magnificent and quite breathtaking.I was very impressed at their relaxed policy over bringing in food of your own. Whilst there were a multitude of places for you to part with more of your money, it was quite possible to get away with very little extra spending. The lines were quite well managed using an online schedule programmer, and by being careful with the fast passes. Finally, we had our 4 month old puppy with us, and we left her in the on site kennels. It was tough on the first day, the kennel was busy and she was a little overwhelmed, however the staff were great and she really settled in, so by the end of the second day she was quite relaxed and they were all loving her!One note, the mornings were by far the best time. We did not even manage to get there early, but by 12 or 1 it was so crowded and hot. We luckily had done most of the day, but did not have stamina to wait for the fireworks etc, none of my kids seemed to mind. Also, to note, the parade was rather lame, in my and my kids opinion. Disney trying too hard and not dellivering on that one. Sorry!",1
Who doesn't love Disneyland. The park was decorated for Halloween and it looked amazing. This was my second time to the park and it's still so much fun. Yes it was super busy and the wait time on rides was over 1 hour but your in Disneyland so who cares. Everyone is happy and the staff friendly and helpful. It's open early (8am) and closes late so plenty of time to experience the whole park. Don't miss the afternoon street parade and nighttime fireworks show (we watched this from our hotel). Food is basic so we took the monorail to downtown Disney for more food options. Thank you Disneyland for bringing out the kid in me : ) ,1
"We arrived there about noon and were done with the park around dinner time. Some restaurants don't serve vegetarian meals and seating can be hard to come by during lunch time, however it was rather empty after the late noon parade. We jumped on rides with no lines, shopped without too much of a hassle, and had a pretty descent time. The park is smaller than the other ones in the world, but it's enjoyable. I wish it would be a bit more themed for the culture and not just all Disney related, but that;s how it is.",1
"We had a great time. Best suggestion for eating is to take the Monorail out to Downtown Disney. The food selection and price is much better. If you have a chance get the park hopper and go to California Adventure too. Finally, get the photo pass, every time they take your photo on a ride or in the them parks, they are uploaded to this card. You can later order a CD of all your images for only $60",1
"This was my first solo visit to Disneyland and, while nervous at first, I absolutely loved it! I recommend for anybody to come here solo as it was so much fun and I couldn   t stop smiling. I was here for 3 days and managed to get a majority of Parc Disneyland done, unfortunately I didn   t get a chance to go to the Studios Park (next time I will). I really recommend seeing Mickeys Phillarmagic   I enjoyed it so much I watched it twice. And the Halloween Parade was excellent, absolutely love Mickeys Illusion Manor. The villain show was also excellent. The Halloween decorations on Main Street and Frontierland were amazing! I loved the decorations in Frontierland, especially the Coco themed ones. As a solo traveler I was worried on the character interactions I would have, but all the characters I met went above and beyond what I expected of them. Chip and Dale kept stroking my fur coat, while Donald Duck was excellent as always and Jack Skellington was great to meet!The cast members are exceptional as well, especially the ladies who were helping Donald on the morning of October 18th for making such a fuss over me it really made my trip (I didn   t get their names, but they loved my Ariel shirt and Donald bag).Disney is truly the most magical place in the world!",1
"Well, what should I say a happiest place on earth its our 3rd time in hongkong disneyland and planning to go back this coming november        ",1
"We had a fantastic trip and due to the ages of the kids we spent a short time in California Adventure and Downtown Disney. We spent most of our time in the Disneyland Park. I highly recommend if you are a AAA member to buy the hopper passes at home before you go. Less $$ and one less line to stand in. Our granddaughters aged 3 and 5 saw princesses galore and rode just about all the age appropriate rides. Our only disappointment was Small World was closed to get ready for Christmas and the Haunted Mansion was overlaid by The Nightmare Before Christmas. I loved the movie but some of our party had not seen it, and it took away some of the entertainment value of the mansion. I had to agree. All in all the first week in November was a great time to visit!",1
"must visit while you are in LA, especially when this is your first time to the US. Children and adults will be happy.",1
If you have option better visit other disneylands... this one is very small and in Sept when we went was very hot and humid.  Typical disneyland fun.. kids will enjoy... parade is fun  Everything inside is very expensive.,1
"First of all I must admit  I am a huge Disney Fan! I absolutely love DIsneyland. The beauty is in the details and you can tell there is so much passion involved in making the park. But I have been to other Disneyland and theme parks, and to be honest the HK one was a bit downer. Its small compared to others, less rides. Must visit for the Disney experience if you are a fan. The fireworks in the evening are spectacular. But otherwise, can give it a miss. ",1
The park was pleasantly beautiful  the enitre park was landscaped with beautiful plants  ride areas shaded with big trees  Enjoyed the park very much,1
What more can I say? It just doesn't get any better than Disneyland! Have been there numerous times over the past 50 years and Disneyland never disappoints. My most recent visit was to celebrate my mom's 86th birthday (and her 1st visit). They made her feel like a Queen! We went to the Town Hall to find out about wheelchair access (we rented one for $12 day) since taking on the whole park by foot at age 86 would have been a bit too challenging for her. They were wonderfully helpful with tips for getting the most from our visit . She was given a 1st timers badge AND a Happy Birthday badge to wear for the day. Disneyland staff and park visitors alike were wishing her a happy birthday by name all day long and she loved it.,1
"If you want to feel like a child again this is the place for you! Smiling faces, beautiful colours, exquisite details, spotlessly clean, music, song and dance : ) the rides are an added extra! Spend at least two days to really immerse yourself and enjoy : )",1
I had the most amazing time in Disneyland Paris. We went at Christmas time and it was so beautiful. We are going back this November and it can't come quick enough!,1
As fun and crowded as ever....there's no place like it!,1
"So if you delight in joining 85,000 other folks experiencing something extraordinary all at the same time, waiting in line for 1 1 2 hours for rides and eating popcorn, corn dogs and other super healthy (not) fast food which cost totally exorbitant prices then Disneyland is the place to bring your family to. Sounding pretty cynical I know however, on the other hand, this theme park is pretty darn exceptional and children of all ages, yes including a lot of adults, really love it. Me, I   m a one day only type of poo hoo adult ... but saying this after the fact I find there are ways to truly enjoy this park... buy the fast track tickets; spend a little more on the entry pass to ensure you jump the ride lines and wow a totally different experience awaits. Disney allows you to bring in your own food so do it... come early (opens at 8am)or come late (closes at midnight). Have to say the parking is pretty easy with well serviced shuttle buses. So all in all my grandchildren simply love it so I love it too... just for that reason! VickiSydneyAustraliaCHECK ME OUT on INSTAGRAM at: vickisworldview",1
I suggest u take the mtr going to disney. Parade starts at 3pm. Dont miss the hyperspace mountain ride. Usually it takes half day to finish all rides . Food and beverages are everywhere . A bit pricey so u must bring water and food if ur on a tight budget,1
"We enjoyed our first visit to Hong Kong Disneyland. Despite having the Hurricane just a few months earlier, they did a good job to present the park in as good as condition as possible. Its a nice compact park once you get there and the attractions are quite well done...no substitute for Anaheim though.",1
"We stayed at Disneyland Hollywood Hotel and quickly got a shuttle to Disneyland. We had pre purchased 2 day tickets which I recommend and got in quickly at opening time. We stayed till the parade, went back to the resort and rested for a few hours before returning to see the light parade which is a must!! It was also a lot quitter at night and we had several goes on many of the rides that had long queues during the day. Having a 2 day pass allowed us to take our time and enjoy the sights at Disney and not spend all our time waiting in lines. It's a great size and almost identical to Disneyland in California. We loved it.",1
Plan on at least three full days. A week if you want a bit slower pace. The Park Hopper ticket is the best value with the most flexibility. Get in line early for a fast pass to cars land because these go fast. The option is to go solo rider. ,1
"disneyland place that I always missed, never bored visit here. I feel the children are happy to meet with his toys. This place recommendation to families",1
"Came here as part for our Honeymoon.We only had 4 hours but enjoyed every minuteThe park is clean and well organized. We were able to do heaps in the 4 hours and enjoyed the authentic Disney shopsEven as adults, we felt like children again and cant wait to bring our 6 year old back (just not sure he would handle the 12 hour flight to get there!)",1
"It doesnt matter if you are 8 or 80. You'll feel like a child once you enter the park! Getting to know all your favourite character, which interact with you, Riding fabolous rollercoaster. It is simply magical !",1
Very convenient to reach from the City Hotels and can have lots fun with kids and adults too !!!!We spent 2 days here covered most of the rides and njoyed a lot. I am sure this is one of the best Disney lands they have,1
"Disneyland has always been fun. We've been twice with three young kids and each time it was entertaining and enjoyable. On this past trip, with the kids somewhat older (9, 11, and 13) it was less of an endurance trip and more of an adventure to hit all the big rides.It was crowded, as it was spring break, but with correct usage of fastpass tickets, we were able to get into all rides fairly quickly. The exception was the Radiator Springs Racers. This was a new ride, so the lines to just the FastPass itself were out of control. In any case, all rides were open, the weather was superb and my family enjoyed the trip.",1
"I've spent more than 200 days in Disney parks and have visited all the parks in California, Orlando and Paris, but nothing holds a candle to the original for me   I instantly feel at home here. It's the park I grew up with, from family vacations and I love the intersection of classic attractions, homage to Walt, and new innovations. I can't say enough good about Disneyland, and I think everyone should visit for at least a day or two in their life. The attractions and shows are amazing, and the new Paint the Night parade is my favorite Disney parade ever. I also adore their version of Fantasmic. Don't miss the Dole Whip Floats in Adventureland! Even without kids in tow, this makes a great date for grownups to let loose the kid at heart!",1
"(Disclaimer: I have a 9 month old son who joined us for this trip.) It is accessible by MTR that makes going to Hong Kong Disneyland quite easy. Step free access everywhere so strolleys and wheel chairs are definitely in. The process of getting a ticket and entering the park is a breeze. Due to its small size, you can actually roam around the park in half a day, so you have to space out the rides properly. Disneyland HK is divided into seven areas, each catering specifically for visitor's needs. Main Street, Fantasyland, Tomorrow Land and Adventure Land offers rides and attractions suitable for children of all ages, while Toy Story Land, Grizzly Gulch and Mystic Point are for more mature and aged visitors. Each of the rides take just about 2 3 minutes, although the waiting time for some attractions may take 15 to 30 minutes for others, so it is suggested that you plan out your rides to maximize your entry. In some of the rides, it literally ends in a shop. If you are pressed for time, move ahead, as the Main Street offers a long range of shops and all the merchandise are found there.There is a parade of Disney stars at around 7:30 PM and a fireworks display at 8:45 PM. Best vantage point would be in front of the Sleeping Beauty castle, just near the roundabout at Main Street. Once the parade of stars and fireworks end, you have about 30 45 minutes, either to freshen up or do some last minute shopping at the Main Street shops, as they are the last to close. There are also dining areas that remain open up till closing time.While I appreciate the entire Disneyland Hong Kong experience, I do have some points for improvement especially for the fireworks display, which is the cap or finale of the activity. There are a lot of smoke generated by the fireworks display that obscure the view of the spectacular fireworks. Perhaps the management can do something about it.Overall, I felt like a kid again. To see and live and dream, a whole new world once more. Kudos. I shall definitely come back here, once my son is big enough to enjoy the sights and sounds of Mickey's world.",1
"We were here last May 2013. Be here early and get your map. Decide on which rides you'd like to try and which shows you'd like to watch so that you'll be able to maximize your stay here. Be sure to be at the premises of the main castle before the the fireworks start so that you'll have the best view. If you can afford to pay for a fast pass ticket, the better, so that you won't waste time waiting in line.Stroller rental is pricey so bring your own stroller for your kids and toddlers.",1
"We visited Disneyland with a 6 day park hopper pass from June 26, 2012. Disneyland never fails to disappoint us when we visit and during this visit Cars Land had just opened so it was BUSY! But Disneyland being Disneyland it was a very organised chaos. My advice for visitors is try planning before you get there and make sure to talk to the park attendants   they can really help out   they know when and where characters will appear, they know which rides are busy or not and they can give some ideas for what to do if kids are getting scratchy.Some of our highlights included lunch at Ariels Grotto for my daughters 3rd birthday, my eldest daughter getting pulled up by the Phineas and Ferb crew to dance with the Fireside girls and taking an animation drawing class for the whole family.My eldest daughter (9) was mad keen on the rides this time and dragged my husband and I on Tower of Terror, Space Mountain, Splash Mountain and even California Screamin'. My little 3 year old was just as happy to meet characters and go on the kiddie rides   her favourite was Pooh Bears ride.Having a park hopper ticket meant that once Caifornia Adventures got super busy (usually after lunch) we could head over to the relative calm of Disneyland which incidentally has a lot more shady spots to relax on hot days. The rides at Disneyland were really quiet compared to California Adventures. Also having a 6 day ticket meant that we could play at leisure and not push the kids   remember this is meant to be fun! Its also really important to keep up the fluids and food as dehydration makes little and big people grumpy!!The character actors are amazing   when we said to Cinderella that my eldest daughter has been looking forward to seeing her  again  she picked it up straight away and said how much she had grown since last time and how has her school been going and does she still wish upon a star etc   Just awesome!!!!Take heaps of photos, enjoy the amazing parades and make lots of memories!",1
"I've been to a few Disney attractions in my day including Tokyo Disney. Compared to other Disney place it's OK but not amazing. It wasn't as busy as Tokyo Disney (I went on a Thursday in July, would probably be busier on a weekend) so I got to go on all the major rides I wanted, first thing in the morning and returning about 7:30 for the night parade and a last few rides. Yes you have to be careful with the timing, it's busiest in the afternoon. If you go when it first opens (10am for 'main street' shopping, 10:30 for the first rides) most of the minor rides have little or no lines. Use the fastpass for Space Mountain or Pooh.If you go in summer, the heat is PUNISHING. There is nowhere to sit and rest in the air conditioning   you're either sitting in the heat (even in the shade it's hot), or standing in the air conditioning (e.g. shopping or once the lines get inside the buildings). There is some indoor dining but of course they're the expensive restaurants. The indoor shows were about the only chance to rest, sitting, inside. So anyway come prepared for the heat   plenty of water, loose clothing, sunscreen, many people use umbrellas for shade. BIGGEST TIP for the heat: buy one of those small handheld electric fans you can pick up at the touristy areas BEFORE going to Disneyland. Inside you can only buy a huge, heavy, expensive Disney fan.All that being said, I still had a good time. I'm glad I went to my hotel for a rest in the afternoon (get your hand stamped and save your ticket to return), then came back for the evening parade and a little bit of fireworks (left before it ended to avoid the crowd going home), even managed to sneak in two more rides right at the end (although many rides close early).Highlight for me was getting a photo with Chewbacca! Yes you have to queue to get a photo but it was worth it. I love roller coasters so my favourite hands down was Space Mountain (Star Wars themed) and the runaway mine car was also super fun.",1
"This was my first time to a Disneyland of any type. I am from Australia, so the best thing we have is Dreamworld or Seaworld. Disneyland was so much better than I had expected. To be honest, I cannot comment on the price of entry, as my trip was paid for by someone else. I was also provided with a fast pass ticket, which again, I did not pay for, but would highly recommend people to get one. It lasts for one day only, so I used it to go on all of the fast pass rides in one day, and then used the next 3 days to visit all of the other rides. Tip  If you stay at one of the Disney hotels, you can enter the park at 8am, and the lines aren't any where near as big. But otherwise, the lines were pretty long and tedious...there were sometimes lines for up to 90 minutes...which is a bit ridiculous I think.I really enjoyed my experience here...I purchased souveniers for my family back in Australia, and spent over 200 Euro's which was pretty costly, considering I really didn't buy alot...but I didn't mind as I had not paid for anything else for the 4 days I was here... including food, which I did notice at some places was very expensive, and to be honest the quality was not the best. I suggest to pack a home made lunch, you will be thankful you did. At 29 years old, I felt like a kid again....The lights, characters, shows and rides were suitable for children and adults alike. Even I was excited to get my photo with some of the Disney Characters. The rides were also good, enjoyable and suitable for most ages. I only came across 2 rides with height restrictions... but most were suitable for families. I am a larger woman, so was a bit worried about fitting into the rides, as I had problems a few years ago in a theme park in Australia, but was so happy that I had not one problem on the rides here. As the rides were suitable for most, the harness seatbelt lap bar, were all pretty loose anyway. I saw people bigger than me going on rides as well, and no one seemed to have any problems. My visit to the park was at halloween, so we entered the park that evening for the halloween night. It cost extra...i think, and was great to see other tourists and staff all dressed up in halloween costumes. The staff were really good, and this would be suitable again for children and adults, provided the children are ok seeing other tourists dressed up as vampires and cannibals. :DI should also add that the toilets were clean at all times, at each different location I entered. There is also  stroller  rental, which are big enough for the whole family to use...I did see a grown man being pushed in one. lol. I don't know how much they cost...but it was a good idea. Both parks were lots of fun...and I can't wait to go back again next year!!!!",1
"We visited from 30 sept to oct 3, excellent timing. If we had known it was going to be this quiet we would have only come for 2 3 days, with virtually no queues at all we rode everything multiple times! Longest wait time we had was 15 mins and many rides were less than 5 mins.Big change from Anaheim! I expect it would be busier on weekends as it was mon to thurs.The downside was several food outlets were closed which left less choice but let's face it, you don't go to Disney for food! Yes food was expensive and not great but that seems to be Europe. Didn't have the atmosphere of California but we found some rides were better, big thunder railroad, haunted mansion, space mountain all brill! Toilets could do with being cleaned more often!",1
We have been euro Disney for Christmas the last 7years it's magicalTime All characters in there Christmas outfits Main Street snows every night which watching the kids faces is lovely Meeting Father Christmas in the park is a must It's a little cold at Christmas time but the parade Christmas is worth getting cold for ,1
a great day to spend with the family and you MUST stay at the end to see the firework display (8.00pm),1
"Disneyland is the one place all visitors put on their  must visit  when they are coming to Southern California.  Prices have gone up, so I would recommend checking to be prepared.  It is a once in a lifetime experience if you have never been.",1
Much smaller than the US counterparts but definitely worth checking if you have a spare day,1
"I have never been to a Disneyland before but having ducked out of the 3 hour wait for a bus to the Big Buddha, Disneyland beckoned. With its own railway link from airport line, the venue is easy to get to. The park was not too crowded on the day of the visit and it was easy to navigate. The venue is focussed on experiences for small children and as my wife and I are not in that category, there were a limited number of attractions that we wanted to participate in. We were however pleased to have visited the site and enjoyed the trip.",1
"Been here many times with my children while they were growing up. Still have to make a trip back every 4 5 yrs to get my kid fix, Disney style. They keep updating which keeps me going back. Now, I use the excuse that I have to go with the grandkids. Love Disney.",1
"From Tsim Sha Tsui, we took MTR (Tsuen Wan Line) until Lai King, 9th stop. Changed train, took Tung Chung Line until Sunny Bay, 2nd stop. Transferred to 3rd train, pink one, and viola...Disneyland! Of course the train was almost full. But no worry, there is one every 5 minutes. We went on a saturday, and just from the train, I was sure that thousands would be enjoying the resort that day. We bought food before entering the gates, @70HKD each meal. Yummy! Just along the road getting inside. Lined up for inspection, and take note you're not allowed to bring meals, only snack is allowed inside. Starting from Moby Dick, picture taking starts. As soon as you enter the gates, you are greeted by Mickey Mouse on the lawn! No phone sticks are allowed! Start with Tomorrowland, then Adventure land, Toy Story, etc etc...One whole day is not enough. You go there with battery full, and end up with battery empty. At 7pm, the Paint the Night Parade will really awaken all energy hiding inside of you coupled with the Fireworks. You line up for another 3 train rides telling yourself that you need to go back the next year!",1
"The park is empty on these days. Not a day before, or after, but on these specific days the park is really low and it is a great time to get around with low lines. If you are a stickler on a turkey dinner, make reservations ahead of time. We ate at the park, watched the evening parade, it was perfect for us. If you haven't been to the park over Christmas...YOU HAVE TO GO! With the castle all iced over, and the snow at the end of the night...it's truly magical.",1
Meet ups with my fave cartoon characters...photos around the overwhelming views inside...you won't stop saying  wow amazing ,1
"Just spent 6 hours at Disneyland with our 8 year old granddaughter! This is not the first time we've been there with her, but we can see at this age, her height qualifies her for more exciting rides! Some rides were reserved for her an her grandfather, but others, we could all enjoy! Our trip was the latter part of October, so apparently it had cooled down a bit. Comfortable but warm. It is a very fun place for all!!",1
had friends take me nice size to roam around in the rides were fun and prices ok for the park spent the day there,1
"I don't think there's anything I can add that hasn't already been said. It's crowded, exhausting, and yet it's always an experience that satisfies, no matter how many times you've been, or how old you are. I haven't been in 30 years and I brought my 14 year old daughter and her dad for the first time ever and it was magical for all of us. ",1
"If you grew up with The Disney Channel like I did, a trip to Disneyland is always an incredible experience. Since I was very little, I have loved the Haunted Mansion and Pirates of the Carribean attractions... Star Tours... etc. and as I got older, I couldn't get enough of Splash Mountain, Space Mountain, The Matterhorn (all the  mountains ) and   now   Indiana Jones. Frankly, I just love being in the park. I go during the winter on a weekday when the traffic is low so I can enjoy eating and playing in peace. Fun trip!BTW   Call in advance and schedule an appointment for Blue Bayou restaurant. It's pricey, but totally worth it!",1
"I have visited Disneyland Park at DRP many many times and it never fails to bring a smile on my face, no matter what might be happening in my life. I have so many good memories since I was a child. The rides I would recommend are Big Thunder Mountain, Phantom Manor, Pirates of the Caribbean and Peter Pan. The message board on TripAdvisor is an excellent source of information, especially for people that have never been before, so head there if you are thinking of going.",1
Hong kond disneyland is by far one of the best amusement parks and one of the best amongst the Disney parks. Much better than Euro Disney as it to some extent combines what Euro Disney refers to as Walt Disney Studios and Disneyland Park. The setting of the park is amazing and lush green and it actually feels like you're in a different world altogether!,1
"Just got back after spending a (very) short break at Disneyland Paris. It was good fun. I went with my two teenage daughters as they have a day off school (inset day). We only went for two days (1 night) as there is no Eurostar on Saturdays during term time. Anyway, we had a good time all round. Euro Disney is now getting old and although it is typical Disney standard, this is our least favourite. There was no firework display (we love fireworks) but the parade was very good. Having been to Disney World (Orlando) and Disney Hong Kong several times (and Euro Disney once before), this is definitely not as exciting and good fun as others. It is good for a short break and we did enjoy ourselves very much. The food and drinks are not cheap but then it is in Paris! We stayed in the Vienna Magic Circus hotel which is very close to the Park (free shuttle service) and it is a lovely hotel with decor in the theme of circus, even the wardrobe!",1
"We stayed across the street and had a 3 day pass. We could walk across the street and go to the park, give the kids a nap and go back to the park later. I was very impressed that EVERYONE at the park was very nice, happy, and very helpfu. One lady was walking to her lunch break and she kept helping answer questions from everyone around her.",1
"Went with family , 2 children age 4 and 13.The Disneyland MTR was nice, took around 10 mins to reach the destination.We went on 7 11 2018, Weather was sunny ,no rain at all.We stayed Novotel City Gate hotel so it was 2 stations to Disneyland which was very convenience.",1
"One important disclaimer: I'm a Florida resident and I'm used to visit Disneyworld more than 5 time a year...This was my third time visiting Disneyland California   but it was the first time with my kids   and the whole experience was just great. We started the day in the other park, Disney California Adventure, and by mid afternoon, we headed to Disneyland (each park entrance are a short walk apart). Our plan was to give priority to the rides that are exclusive to this park: Indiana Jones, Nemo's submarine, Matterhorn, Roger Rabit's ride and so one... I don't know if we are getting experts on crowd avoidance, but everything worked fine and we also had time to many other rides   and itv was a busy spring break friday!I have a lot of respect for Disneyland   it was the first Disney park and Walt spent a lot of time and work here. Somehow you can tell and feel that.",1
try and go midweek if you can as we went on a weekend and it was packed.,1
My girlfriend and I took our two girls to Disneyland for their 21sts. We had an absolute ball. Staff are super friendly and helpful. Most definitely the happiest place on earth!!,1
"We all really enjoyed it, 2nd time here and it's just as good, hundreds of things to do plenty of water fountains, got in 2 hours early with our passes and got on some of the rides with the fast passes, plenty of places to get snacks, water and ice cream etc, loads of shops for souvenirs, my sister and I loved the Christmas shop and the kids loved all the toy shops, everyone was very helpful and cheery. Loved it can't wait to do it again but maybe at Christmas.",1
"The best thing about the park is it's size. You can get round 90% of the attractions in a day, but you really need two days to do all (stay at the hotel and you get the second days ticket free). The stage shows are magnificent and should not be missed. The other great thing about the park is once your through the gates the weather doesn't matter, of course sun is best but as most attractions are under cover rain is not a problem and usually means less people. In my view the park is best suited for those under 14 years as older young adults may consider the rides tame. All rides are great fun but Autoria the car ride suffers from long queues and is not worth the wait for an eight minute ride. Get in the park early, before 10am, if you want to go on this ride. Also Poh Bear ride is very busy so get a Fast Pass ticket early on and use this to save a 30min wait. Save buying anything in the shops until 5pm as carrying stuff around is hard work. The fireworks at 7pm or 8pm are worth the wait.The choice of food in the park is extensive and good value and quality. The park is spotlessly clean, excellent toilet facilities, stroller hire and has everything needed for a great day out.",1
"I have been to the original Disneyland in LA and also to Disney World in Florida and my wife has been to Disneyland Japan, but we both kept an open mind going to Disneyland Hong Kong, it would do no justice to Disneyland Hong Kong to make comparisons. That being said Disney HK is a good place to go with kids for sure, but ideally it should be done on a weekday unless you want lots of pain and go on a weekend. I can only imagine the waiting time in the rides on a weekend given the over all size of Disney HK. You have to spend a day here to get to ride all the rides for sure. I also suggest not doing this on a hot summer day, late November is good as it is sunny but cool. Getting to Disney HK is easy with lots of public transportation available so that is not a hassle at all.",1
"A fantastic day out, as expected food and drinks are pricey but there are fast food places which aren't too bad. The parades are good but the firework and light display at the end of the day is out of this world! Truly magical!",1
"Kids should be able to visit this place at least once in their lifetime, it's the most amazing place for them",1
"Visited end of July during the 60th Anniversary celebration of Disneyland. Went on a Monday and Tuesday. WEAR SUNSCREEN AND HATS and bring a fan or one of those squirt fans. VERY CLEAN compared to the Orlando Park. The cue lines are out in the open sun, compared to the Orlando Disney parks which put guests mostly under shelter or inside a building. NO SANATIZER around to use to you might want to bring some along. Get there early to grab fast passes for longer wait lines such as Matterhorn and space mountain. FAST PASSES are the old way of having to be there to get a ticket and only a few rides offer them. By 10 PM they are gone for the day. Kids REALLY liked Disneyland's space mountain over Orlando's. This was their favorite ride from either Disneyland or California Adventure parks. It was fun comparing parks. Non Disney hotels were closer and offer less expensive options than in Orlando where every non Disney hotel is at least 3 to 5 miles away. Both nights the park became quite crowded for the parade and night shows. Disneyland entrance is about 500 feet across a hub area from California Adventure, which is also the hub for downtown Disney area which is much smaller than Orlando's Downtown but much more accessible. Parking areas were in parking garages similar to that used by Universal in Orlando and they had some on the ground. Parking was relatively fast along with a shuttle tram the entrance area.FOR EMPLOYEES OF DISNEY  their property control and Company D store is worth the trip. much better than in Orlando. ONLY OPEN TO EMPLOYEES WITH ID.",1
"Everything we'd hoped it would be! Loved the shows, mild but wild rides and the coming together of the film experience with theme park.",1
"This was my second visit to Disneyland (the first 20 years ago) and I had a blast. My husband and I went on a Thursday in June (no kids). We were there from 9am until 8.30pm and did everything we wanted to laughing and grinning all day like kids. My advice is to plan your day and you should be able to get to your favourite rides. I heard about the long queues and didn't want to come all the way from NZ and to spend my day waiting in queues. So I read trip advisor and downloaded a great Disneyland app and got some great tips. First: before you go online and get to know the rides, decide what you absolutely can't miss, figure out the fastpass system for jumping queues, and make a plan for the day. With my plan we got to see everything we wanted with plenty of time to soak in the atmosphere too. My husband was reluctant to follow my plan to start with but by the end of the day we had waited no more than 20 minutes for a ride (most of the time waiting no more than 5 minutes) and he happily conceded that my plan made the day fun. Second: go as early as you can and resist the temptation to stop and marvel at everything when you first arrive. Do your 'must do' rides in the morning and then go back to enjoy the atmosphere in the afternoon when Disneyland gets crazy busy. Third: if you are not really a parade watching type person then this is a good time to get onto rides with short wait times. Forth: just roll with it. If a ride is closed or the timing doesn't work out then just enjoy another fun Disneyland activity. Unfortunately we couldn't stay to see the fireworks due to early flight in the morning. Our favourites were Indiana Jones, big thunder and star tours. Go and keep the kid in you alive. ",1
"Late review here ... Visited HK Disneyland in 2013 ,december. This place totally turns one into a kid again , with characters we once loved , colorful attractions..... The rides are awesome , suitable for people of all ages but young at heart. Children are able to enjoy most of the rides while thrill seeking people have choices such as space mountain and r racer . Although it is a relatively small theme park , but it is filled with so much fun ! A must go for Disney fans and children . Plan a whole day trip from morning to night as there are firework display at night which Is magnificent .",1
"I spent the best day here, so many rides to go on, so many characters to see and the atmosphere has to be absorbed to appreciate this place. A must if your in Paris. During summer, the park doesn't close till 11, so you have plenty of time to do all the rides, but best to on a weekday. Best rides defintely are Space Mountain 2, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Peril (hardly any lines) and Great Thunder Rail Road.The rides that had long waits are the ones without fast pass, namely Pirates of the Caribbean. Also Peter Pan's flight is a long wait, but that's a must, above average storybook ride",1
"Our family spent a total of 5 days in Disneyland California Adventure between Feb 5 12. Having been there in February before, we knew that there would be some things closed for refurbishment but we also knew that the trade off would be shorter lines due to it being low season.Like usual, the parks were very clean and the staff were friendly and helpful. Considering the number of people there, I was once again amazed at how clean the parks were from the start of the day to the end.The disappointing part of Disneyland CA were the number of things closed for refurbishment. While we were there, Big Thunder, Splash Mountain, Small World, the river boat, Fantasmic, the main gate train station, Grizzly River Rapids, Muppet's 3D, Mickey's Symphony Swings, and World of Colour (4 out of the 5 days we were there) were all closed. Not only was it disappointing not be be able to see or go on those attractions but it seemed to put some pressure on the other rides (  longer line ups). I'm not sure if Disney felt that since they now have Carsland, they could close many of the parks' best rides and people wouldn't notice.Carsland is GREAT. It's visually stunning as you feel like you've stepped into the movies. Radiator Springs Racers is by for the best ride out of the 3 in Carsland. I've never seen a line up for FastPasses like the one for the Racers! You almost needed a FastPass to get a FastPass. If you didn't get one in the first hour and half of the park opening, you were out of luck as they were gone for the day. The posted line up time for Racers was anything from 45 to 110 minutes we were there. The FastPass seemed to cut it down to about 1 4 of the posted time. The next best option was to do the Single Rider Line which seemed to cut the wait time down to 1 3 of the posted time.Overall it was good (B or B ) but not the best Disneyland experience we've had.Yes, the food was VERY expensive. We know that going in and you just have to plan for it.",1
"We are annual pass holders at Disneyland in California and have also been to Disneyworld and on Disney cruises so you can say we are fans. :). We were in Paris, so of course wanted to check out Disneyland in Paris. My expectations were somewhat low based on reviews here. Our day definitely exceeded expectations. The train ride there is easy peasy. You are dropped off at the front gate. Since we only had one day, we decided just to visit the Magic Kingdom. We went on a Tuesday, I believe before school was out in Paris so the longest we waited for any ride was 15 minutes and we walked on most rides. We did not experience any staff members that were not very pleasant and interested in creating the magic. In fact, we had a few very pleasant interactions with cast members. We were happy to see the railroad ride was open as it's been under construction in CA for what seems like ages. It seems much larger than the CA ride as well. We took a wrong turn exiting and ended up in the disabled line, perhaps? Not sure but we asked the cast member where to go and he offered to let us hop on the ride again (there was a 15 minute wait or so). We said  sure!  and he said  see, the magic can happen!  Lol. Very nice. The Pirate and Haunted Mansion rides were very cool  almost better than the CA Disney. The Indiana Jones ride was surprisingly an outdoor roller coaster with a loop! Was not expecting that! There are other cool experiences that the US parks don't have such as a huge pirate play area. We were disappointed to miss the Ratatouille Ride and their Tower of Terror in the other park All in all, a fun day and cool experience! Our experience with food was not great. The Italian place has extremely long lines and blah food. The expensive buffet on Main Street was crowded and bad. Our server was not good. The tap water served tasted like dirt. As far as the other guests in the park, it was interesting for me to see women in full burkas with their kids enjoying the parade and Disney fun. We saw many people in Disney apparel who clearly loved it. It was an interesting experience. We saw very few Americans. ",1
We were lucky enought to get here after way over 20 trips to WDW. Much smaller and rides different. So funny to see how tiny this castle is in comparison to Cinderellas :o) We had a ball!,1
"If you are an Indian and a lover of Disney, the easiest and economically best is Hong Kong Disneyland. The Disney theme music playing constantly in the area and the attractions will make your dream come true.The best part were the magnificent Disney theater show.Food was an issue as there were not any options for vegetarian except fries, but you can carry small eatables inside the park.The train journey is an experience in itself. Be there early morning to avoid the crowd and waiting time for rides.",1
"Still magical after all these years, even to our 2 teens. The fireworks and lights show was unbelievably good, and most rides were available. Few breakdowns as usual though, but nothing to get too grumpy about. Just 2 gripes (but doesn't dent the 5 stars):1. Few bits of maintenance need doing and unlike Disney, it was obvious! Queue waiting times not working and being replaced with a grotty piece of paper (Indiana Jones); waiting time display on the main street missing 2 or 3 rides due to the bulbs not working; fast pass machines out of order in large numbers. Needs sorting as that's not Disney!2. Meet Mickey is a nightmare! You used to be able to queue in various places around the park to meet him, now it's all in one place in his theater. Queue times never fell below 45 mins and the queue moved glacially slowly. The reel of Mickey cartoons ran out when we were there! Go back to meeting him in the park guys, far nicer experience!Overall though we remain massive fans of the Magic Kingdom and will be back! ",1
"We visited over the bank holiday weekend and rightly expected it to be busy. We found the queues manageable by using the app and heading to the quieter ones, using fast passes and early mornings to access the bigger rides. The park is lovely to see, it's very pretty and more manageable than Orlando with small children. It was clean and staff were helpful. The fast pass and restaurant booking system would be so much better on an app like in America, queuing up for a fast pass to avoid queuing up for a ride is a big silly. We found the parade and fireworks show we're fantastic but also the hardest to access with small children. People literally line the pavements over an hour before the shows start. In 33 degree heat, we weren't prepared to do that. For the fireworks we found people had no problem standing in front of small children, blocking their view or pushing into them. At one point my 4 yo was yelling at people to stop pushing her. There are lots of trees   obstructions so finding a spot is hard. Other than that, my other issue was with the smokers. I find smoke disgusting and have a real issue with it in my face. There are designated smoking areas but people didn't stick to them and as it was hot, without a breeze the smoke smell lingered everywhere. People were smoking in confined spaces near the parade and even in a queue at one point. I think this is a real issue Disney should clamp down on! I was thankful to those who chose to vape. I love Disneyland Paris and would go back (probably at a quieter time).Disney   Please sort the smokers and the booking app out though!",1
"Well where to start! The park is amazing,most of the staff are friendly and helpful although there is the odd extremely rude staff member!! We did not queue that long for rides and enjoyed every second of our long weekend. One bad point was that a member of staff physically pushed me when the star wars show was on and the characters were walking through the crowds to the stage,this is definitely not what Walt Disney nor the current owners would want to see or hear!! If that had been a small child they would have pushed them over,even the character behind him put his her hand up at me to check I was ok! I was not in the way just at the front of the queue behind me as I'm a petite woman. I didn't let this ruin the show or my day however. I would recommend a visit here to not just families but groups of adults too (we can all be big kids when it comes to disney)! Fantastic time had by all,we will definitely be back again soon. ",1
"Disneyland as usual   fabulous quality, but incredibly expensive",1
"I took my daughter to Disneyland once when she was 3, so of course she only had a vague memory of the Park. This was a surprise for her birthday yesterday and she had no idea we were going until we actually got to the parking structure (luckily she fell asleep on the way). She was excited, shocked and amazed and it was perfect. We had the BEST time, just the two of us    mommy and daughter. The customer service at Disney is TOP NOTCH and the fact that we went on a Wednesday, AFTER spring break ended made all the difference in the crowds and the lines on rides. We never waited more than 10 minutes to ride anything. The longest wait time was 40 minutes for Space Mountain but we just got a fast past and went to get on Star Tours and got Dole Whips while waiting for the time to pass. I admit I woke up this morning sorta sad and melancholy because our Disneyland trip was over. I can't wait to go back, but this time we will make it a two day trip.",1
We enjoyed more rides at the park this time as everyone seemed to be at California Adventure Park. Wait time was just the walk through the entrance on many rides.Good time to take advantage of short lines for us.More leaves on the ground than we had seen on previous trips   must be the time of year. Park personnel were busy as usual cleaning everywhere.,1
We have been to Florida and Paris Disneyland and this falls into the Paris side of things. We all enjoyed our day out here and would we promised our girls a trip to Disney when in Hong Kong. It is good and fun for the kids but remember it is NOT Florida size.,1
What an amazing place!!! I love going to everything disney!!  We went around Thanksgiving and it was very busy.,1
"I was on trip Venice Paris Disneyland with my family, and we got only one day in Disneyland. But with magic hours (extra 2 hours), it was great and long day.Everything, from rides, attractions, staff, the whole park, was perfect.My three years old daughter was living in dream, she has met her favorite princess, enjoy on rides, hug cartoon characters, it was perfect day.you can also rent strawler, it is great solution for kids to take a nap or just rest.At the end of the day they have illumination show, it is worth waiting for.",1
"We went to the park because of our 8 year old son. For small children less than 5 6 years there are not so many attractions, but for children older than 6 7 and for adults there are a lot of attractions. Some of them were closed when we came, but the rest were very interesting. The big minus is that there are a lot of people and you waste a lot of time before you get to the attraction, in some cases about 40 min. The tip is to use the fast track, you need to scan your entry tickets and get a ticket to the fast track for a special time, and then it's much faster. If you don   t want to waste a lot of money for the food, than take some snack, fruits and water with you. But anyway, in the park there a lot of restaurants, cafes and fast food cafes inside. Prices are higher than in the city.",1
"Our family of 5, 2 adults and 3 teenagers decided to tackle Hong Kong Disney after visiting Paris Disney a few years ago. The teenagers were very excited to be able to now ride on the rides that they couldn't last time as they were too young. They were disappointed that there were not the great rides and roller coasters that are at the other Disneylands. Most of the rides were child oriented, not so much for teenagers. Anyway, we still had a great day. It is quite small, so easily done in a day, which is good as it was really hot. The Lion King show was fantastic and a highlight. The lines were ok, we ended up going on the  single rider  line as it was way shorter and we didn't care that we didn't sit together because we got a lot more rides this way. Food choices were very limited and we had to sit outside to eat in the heat.",1
"We are Disneyland fans and were excited to get to visit the one in Hong Kong. We loved that you take a disney train to the park with all the disney details like windows shaped like Mickey, it helped build up the excitement for our children for our big day.It definitaley caters to the asian market and focus's more on shows than it does on rides. They have autotopia and space mountain but since many of the people thought that Space mountain would be too scary of a ride we were able to ride it 4 times without any lines. The longest line was for Pooh's adventure and we had to utilize the fast pass feature to ride that one. The shows are amazing and done with disney style. If you are from America just plan on a completely different disney experience, but one still filled with all the Disney magic.",1
"Me n my bro went there at 2 pm and were there till 8pm.We enjoyed every bit of moment there.Although its primerily meant for kids n young age groups,but in my opinion any1,from any age group wil enjoy there.We specially liked the rides n the...More",1
"Was a wonderful time. Our toddler was old enough to go on some rides, which was great. She wasn't well during our stay, and so we did have to pay a visit to the health centre there. They were so great with her, and gave us some very good advice and medicine. She was almost 60% better the next day, and about 2 days later 100%. Definately going back.",1
"My favourite place in the world. So magical. Expensive, yes but worth every cent. Both parks can be done in one day if you know what you're doing but 2 3 days is best. I can't wait to return!!",1
"We went in August so it was very very busy, queues over one hour for most rides, but we met lots of characters, enjoyed the parade and fireworks but feel they should do the fireworks earlier as by 11.15pm most of the children were to tired to care or asleep on parents shoulders, agrabah restaurant was the best food we ate in the park, blue lagoon restaurant was a bit disappointing as the food wasn't great, overlooked salmon and veg. Overall the kids had a great time but the best part for them was meeting Spider Man, woody, and Mickey. Best rides for our 2 was crushers coaster in Walt Disny studio park as they were too small to get on space mountain. Our eldest done the Jedi training academy and this was definitely a highlight of the trip but you have to queue up 1st thing to get in.",1
"I have been going to Disneyland since I was a kid. I have been a passholder for over 12 years now. There is so much to see and do here. If you are a local I recommend getting a pass. You can ride rides, eat food and watch the parade. Go as early as you can when the park opens to avoid some of the crowds. Use fast passes as much as you can, this is where you get a reservation to return to a ride between a certain time that is on the fast pass. You walk past most of the crowds this way. You can only get one per annual pass or entrance ticket at a time but as soon as the time frame starts you can get another one. Fastpasses are your friend. If you don't mind missing the parade this is a good time to jump on rides. The Christmas version of the small world is a must see as well as the Nightmare before Christmas version of the Haunted mansion. If you want to see the parade get a seat early, grab a cup of hot cocoa and some food and you are good to go. Well worth it.",1
"our 3 day trip to Disneyland Paris was a lovely family weekend and we had a really good weekend. It had all the usual Disney elements that make it a wonderful experience, there were just a few small things over the weekend that took the whole experience to good instead of great!Food was a really problem over the whole 3 days. There are simply not enough places to grab something on the go in park. The French seem to completely misunderstand the concept of 'fast' food as the counter service places that were open were ridiculously slow to get served & when you are visiting a park for the attractions, rides, shows and parades this is just unacceptable. Twice we experienced food stands being shut or service points closing when there were huge queues   not at all customer service focused.Secondly, we were on the half board deal but there were so few places we were able to use this that we ended up not really using this   maybe that's the idea. It worked when we had booked dinner weeks before, but we didn't know definite plans on other days and just couldn't get a table anywhere and the counter service places were a non starter as we didn't want to spend an hour queueing.Leaving the park after the evening show was horrendous. It is so utterly disorganised with people trying to push through in 2 directions, instead of staff organising some sort of one way system   I would hate to have had a push chair!Extra magic hours were good although very geared towards younger visitors in Disneyland Park and it would be good if they opened another more grown up ride.",1
Suggestion: get a park hopper ticket so you can go between Disneyland and California Adventure.  It's a bit more costly but really worth the extra money especially if you are only spending one or two days there.,1
"I was at DLP on the last week of July. It was my first time and it has been amazing. We took our 3 years and a half old daughter, and I must confess that it is a right age to go. In the beginning we were not sure about it, but in the end we have realized that it was a right decision. Being there and having met the princesses let her speechless and it was really funny. Although it was high season, the amount of people was not so high and the queues were not so long. We used the single rider queue to ride and it used to be much faster than the rest, although after the parade our feeling was that the people had left the park and then the time for the queues decreased. The staff is always there for you and any question that you have they answer with a smile. If I had to comply for something would be that there is not a daily program of where and when the random characters appear, that would be very helpful but it might affect to the    magic   . So, all in all, I would recommend to visit at least a single time and do not doubt taking you children with 3 years, it is a perfect age for them, the magic exists.",1
"We are HUGE WDW fans! However, despite Disneyland being smaller, we found we liked both parks here as well, just differently. After getting a Jedi Training slot for the little one (go early ie 0800 and NLT 0900), we were able to ride most rides in Tomorrowland she wanted to ride (Astro Blaster, Autotopia, Hyper Space Mountain, and Nemo Subs) without too much of a wait (no more than 15 mins) before returning for her jedi training show time at 1000. While my husband was waiting   riding with our 6 yr old, I popped over to adventure land to grab fast passes to the other rides she wanted to get to (Thunder Mountain, Splash Mountain and Indiana Jones). All these were doable with very little wait, no more than 10 mins using our fast passes. The only down side we saw to Disneyland is that it seems a lot less organized in comparrison to WDW esp for the evening parades & fireworks. Sadly, both days we had here the fireworks didnt work. ",1
"They really ought to put a cap on the number of people they let in the gates each day. There were rides with two hour wait times. I know it is summer but really??? Very clean, great shows and parades, and worth it. Just be ready to wait in line.",1
"Disneyland is my Favorite getaway. I am a disney passholder, have been for 3 years. If you live in Southern California I do recommend getting an annual passport. You get more for your money and Annual pass Perks. Just recently they started an early hour entry to the park of your choice for the summer. But you do have to register.Also discounts on food and Merch and invitations to some disney events they have from time to time.If you are on a budget I recommend bringing an ice chest for drinks and food and buy a locker in the picnic area at disneyland but make sure the ice chest is not to big it needs to fit in locker.They do have different size lockers at a price. Also, what I do to not over spend, I buy a disney gift card at my budget amount so Im not carrying money and credit cards so I don't have that urge to over spend.During the Summer months I freeze bottles of water and put them in a hydration backpack and add snacks. It's easy to carry around and the frozen water keeps your back cool and you don't need to give into buying high price bottled water at the park.On Main Street if you buy coffee at the Market house free Coffee all day just show your receipt for a refill.",1
What can I say? It's Disney! First time trip for 2 of the kids we brought with us (high school graduation trip!). Made some wonderful memories here and everyone had a great time! Did a LOT of walking but it was nice to have older kids who could take off on their own. First time my husband and I were able to enjoy Disneyland & California Adventure Park by ourselves! I think it was the first time we truly enjoyed ourselves and didn't feel rushed (even though we only had 2 1 2 days).,1
Great park but to really enhance the experience and use your time wisely get to know the Fastpass and think of every other ride ahead of time. Fastpass the popular rides and wait on the less popular rides. You'll thank me for the time savings.,1
"Loved the place and its heaven for kids.Best part is fireworks and Disney parade ,that happens after 7pm.Rides more suited for kids but enjoyed a lot here.",1
"I love Disneyland. We've had our ups and downs over the years, but I could never imagine life without it. As a friend of mine once said (in jest, though there was more truth in it than he could ever know),  Disneyland isn't a theme park   it's a lifestyle! For those of us who've been bitten by the Disneyland bug, it really is! Certainly, you can get an amazing Disney theme park experience at Walt Disney World or one of the international parks, but nothing compares to Walt's original Magic Kingdom. The atmosphere is intimate, the landscape is beautiful, and many of the attractions are unique (even those with counterparts at the other parks). This is also the ONLY park Walt Disney personally touched, figuratively as well as literally. The resort as a whole might be a bit bewildering if you're used to the grand expanses of Walt Disney World, however, as the  Resort  is carved out of what used to be the Disneyland parking lot plus a few regular city blocks. There are only two theme parks, three official resort hotels, and an abbreviated version of Downtown Disney. And no, Sleeping Beauty Castle isn't nutty tall like Cindy's, but that doesn't bother me in the least. Size matters not, whether you speak of castles or the resort as a whole. Disney's California Adventure   across the esplanade from Disneyland Park   is a pleasant, developing theme park. I wouldn't class it with Disneyland, but that's kind of a no brainer considering that it's only seven years old and was constructed on a gravely small budget. It's getting some grand, expensive additions in the nearish future, though, which should shut the naysayers up for a little while at least. It's also got a few nice thrill rides for those who swing that way. It's not exactly Six Flags, but that's a good thing. The three resort hotels are very nice, but if you're used to the crazy theming of the WDW deluxe hotels, you might be a little disappointed by Paradise Pier Hotel and perhaps even the Disneyland Hotel. They're older properties, originally built and maintained by other companies, so they look  converted  to some degree. Big changes are coming to the Disneyland Hotel, however, which should fix some of that. Also, the Disneyland Hotel has NICE BIG rooms and a beautiful, Neverland themed pool. It also has Hooke's Pointe and Goofy's Kitchen, which are fun places to eat. Goofy's has my favorite character meal on property, and Hooke's serves excellent meals in a pleasant, themed atmosphere. The Grand Californian is comparable to WIlderness Lodge or Animal Kingdom Lodge in theming quality and amenities. It's also crazy expensive. Actually, unless you can ride a sweet Annual Pass, AAA, or seasonal promotion discount, ALL THREE Disney hotels are pretty darned expensive. And unlike Walt Disney World, where staying  on property  is part of the experience, you won't miss much   if anything   by staying at one of the very good non Disney hotels in the area. Some of the Harbor Blvd. properties are just as close   if not closer   to the action than DLH and PPH. In all, I highly, highly, highly recommend a visit to the DLR. Don't assume that going to Walt Disney World is an automatic substitution, because it isn't. If you're a a Walt Disney fan, you need to make your pilgrimage at least once during your lifetime. If you don't really care about the heritage of the company and just want to take your kids to a Disney theme park, Walt Disney World might be a better choice for you.",1
It was indeed the happiest place on earth! My family had really fun and it made my daughter's birthday a memorable one!,1
We had the most amazing time! The wait times were not too bad in the beginning of March and the weather was wonderful thanks to the terrible drought. My boys (5 and 7 months) had a great time.,1
"Take Uber or Lyft from your hotel, which will save you money especially if you have 4 or 5 in your party! The shuttle bus is very expensive and charges per person. There is a spot on Harbor Street where you are dropped off. You can also drop off and pickup disabled people there. Disney is not disabled friendly any longer (due to the scandal a few years ago where a few in wheelchairs were  selling  themselves to get people through lines quickly). The wheelchair we rented was terrible to push, we had to know whether we were coming back for the evening or pay another $12 to rent again. There was no disability parking available the day we didn't take Uber and we had to park really far away in an empty lot. At night there were no workers guarding the cars. The streets were dark and there were no people walking about. It wasn't even that late! There were a few people selling toys on the street corners. The food has gone downhill since we were there a year ago. The au jus french dip at New Orleans was all just grease and the sandwich had little meat. The bread was dry. Desserts were all good but almost as expensive as the food. Next time I will try eating at Fantasy Land!",1
"Amount of time to spend in each park in order to cover all rides: 2 daysBest and cheapest tickets: AAA office in Anaheim (despite what web vendors may claim, after exploring many of the  discount tickets , AAA was cheaper by about $80 on three 5 day passes, mainly because they did not add taxes and fees, which were added by all the other companies just before check out. The AAA 5 day pass INCLUDES PARKING! This saves you a great deal on a hotel, since you don't have to stay near the main gate.Hotels: main gate is not the only option, anywhere around Disney is fine, since you will likely be near one of the parking lots, from which busses and shuttles will take you into the resort. With the 5 day ticket, it really does not matter how far you are, since you will have parking, Even if you are driving from a near by hotel, your parking may be quite far away, there is no way to pick where you park. You have to park where you are directed. The busses and shuttles are very quick and efficient, though. Even though we were 15 min walk away, it was still worth driving in and parking at the resort, especially on hot days. The last thing you want to be doing is walking beside a highway for 15 min on a hot day, after a day of walking in the park. Even for the younger children, we found Disney California Adventure to be more fun than Disneyland. California Adventure has Bugsland and Carsland, as well as many younger rider geared rides. Overall it also had much shorter lines.",1
"We needed the three day Disney Pass with the early morning included , there was so much to see and do. Best attractions. 1 World of Color. 2 Star Tours. 3. California Dream Roller coaster. For my daughter World of Color was the best attraction of our three week holiday. Drinking fountains great, very clean and tidy, fantastic for disabled people. Can not speak highly enough of the professional staff. ",1
"I have fond memories of Disneyland as a small child and after having gone to Walt Disney World as an adult, I couldn't wait to share the experience of Disneyland with my family.  Loved California.",1
"While I used to have an AP, I've had to limit my visits to once a year since I moved away. Still have the same feelings about the land itself. But the admission prices are out of control.",1
"This place is just unreal. It exceeds all expectations and they were quite high to start off with. Everything is really well done and the technology in there makes the place enchanted. It honestly makes you feel like you're in a fairytale. It's a big day tho if you want to see everything, so either get plenty of sleep before you get there or get the 2 day pass. I would imagine family would need even more time. The place is very well designed for crows and pumps it through. Absolute must do in Hong Kong",1
"yes its small, no its no florida and thats why its cheaper... at least this place you can walk around in one day... Land is few and far between in HK so expect it to be small... but its still a good day out no matter how many people I hear complain about it ",1
"We visited 1 week ago with a 4 year old on a 1 day 1 Park ticket and also a 1 day 2 park ticket. Reason for this was that at the Disney studios a lot of the rides are not suitable for younger children and so we returned to Disney park late afternoon. I was also 35 weeks pregnant which meant I was able to get the    easy access pass    from the City Hall within Disney Park. All I needed was a letter from GP and ID. This meant that we didn   t have to queue but were able to receive a time for 1 ride at a time from the staff and return and get straight on. We had an amazing 2 days on rides and watching shows, truly magical. They are long days but well worth it. Book tickets prior to arriving and take food with you. We did have a meal a day there which cost around    12 15 and portion sizes were good. General drinks, ice creams and souvenirs are very pricey.Get the maps and show times on arrival so you can plan your days to ensure you get to see all the shows.",1
"We thoroughly enjoyed our time. I did my research and read the forums and we had an excellent break. Polite staff. When we left a camera(!!) on a ride it was taken immediately to lost property. Mid week we got on most rides fine, the place was clean. Food was expensive, but as we'd read reviews we expected and budgeted for this. An example, first day 18 Euros for a pizza!!!! Last day 18 Euros for a pizza, that's not bad. Mickey's cafe was a right laugh on the last night! We all enjoyed ourselves and our stay Newport Bay Club, which is about a 10  15 min walk from the parks. Both parks were enjoyed. ",1
"We had great fun and the park was as good as we imagined. Beautiful parades, especially the night one, and the fireworks were impressive. The park was not too crowded and the attractions were great. The gluten free options in restaurants were great.",1
"It is Disneyland.  Kids love coming here.  Always a good experience, just have a relaxed attitude.  Dont be by negatively affected by others.",1
"We're both big kids a heart and had a absolute ball!! Three visits and we still haven't had enough. Well run and set up, immaculately clean and friendly staff. Pick the time you go carefully as it can get very busy during school holidays and weekends. There is so much variety in food, rides, attractions and places to chill. The US is not complete without a visit to Disneyland.",1
"French Disneyland is great same rides as the usual Disneyland, great happy staff and great rides, pity they dont chnage what rides are open for magic hours the five days we were there they were the same rides, you can only go on Buzz & Space Mountian so many times, I think we clocked up 13",1
"I love everything Disneyland! The food, the attractions, the rides! The only downside is how expensive everything is. It really does cost a fortune for a family of four to go.",1
"Disneyland is such a magic place we had a wonderful time there but the lack of characters was extraordinary. I have a 11 year old son and he always loves meeting the characters and normally we get about 30 this time we got 12 and we were very shocked.We were shocked to discover that the characters don't come to any hotels except the Disney hotel.we also travelled all the park to find characters and found one.Also the rare characters ( The incredibles , Sully,Pinocchio etc) none were found",1
"Disney Magical indeed! Only downfalls   way too busy! Went during Spring Break time and even though the park was open 8 till midnight every day, it was busy every moment and often nearly imposible to get anywhere because of people traffic.Fireworks set to music in the evening were incredible, and the Fantasmic show was awesome!Disneyland Park does seem very much like Magic Kingdom but smaller   I prefer Magic Kingdom better.",1
"Great time to visit as the crowds were low. BEST part was the Parade. Be sure and get a spot on main street where you can sit on the curb and enjoy the FANTASTIC lights, songs & show! So great! The fireworks over the CASTLE was pretty fabulous too! ",1
"Wonderful park, although obviously not a big as Orlando.  The closing firework light display on the Castle is not to be missed!",1
"This is my 2nd time to visit hongkong disneyland and the joy you will feel inside is different... You will see only the people, the children are smiling.. No negative energy at all.. It will bring out the child within you.. And as for the children.. that smile on their faces is priceless...",1
"2 days here is heaps, parades great, but it is not Anaheim...as long as you know that you will enjoy it Easy to get around, rides not busy in April, but go during the week as locals use Annual passes Fri Sun so crowds increase. Can take food and drink in, but keep it to snacks and no problems. Only downside was the staff were not friendly or happy (compared to Anaheim where everyone is friendly and happy).",1
"I love Disneyland, we come every year for spring break it's just so magical I love all the food and parades ...the firework show",1
"I simply love Disneyland; it really is the happiest place on earth! The park is impeccably clean and the service is amazing. The food is all pretty good and I think the value is fairly good. I would highly recommend getting the Disney Max Pass. For $10 per day, you get access to book Fast Passes (FP) on your phone via the Disneyland app. The app tells you what time the next available time slot is, and you can select that time. You can book your next FP when your current one has commenced (or 90mins later if you are having to book a FP for later in the day). You can have a max of 3 booked at any one time. The best rides are Space Mountain, Indiana Jones, Splash Mountain, Pirates. The Pixar parade at 6pm is great and obviously you can   t miss the fireworks at 9.30pm. ",1
My third visit to the park through the years but more importantly my daughters first visit to a Disney park... she loved every moment of it from meeting the characters to getting the change to meet a  real life  princess. The roller coasters are as good as i remember ,1
"It's very easy to get to Hkg Disney, cheap and fast as we'll by getting on the MTR. It's on a much smaller scale in comparison to the CA Disney but it is still a fun place to be. Bit disappointed as some of the characters like Donald Daisy Duck weren't even there and Mickey and Minnie were on their summer outfit instead of wearing their ever popular outfit which really symbolises them. Most of the main characters (Mickey, minnie, pooh, Pluto and goofy) are always meeting fans in the backyard garden. As always food are expensive in this kind of places. Even though is small, you might still need close to 2 days if you are travelling with children who would want to go on every ride that are available there as the Q can be quite long! Tips...don't go exactly on opening time so that you won't have to Q up and get pushed around by the others who can get quite annoyingly impatient!! Bring an umbrella during summer   mosquito repellent as well!!",1
"Went on April 11, 2013, a Thursday. Day started out overcast, but ok, and as soon as we stepped off the special Disney subway car, the skies opened and started to pour! We almost turned around, but decided to go anyway. It ended up much better than my rain sodden expectations would have let me to believe. The prior reviewers are right   it is smaller, with a less expensive entry ticket, and I can see how the PRC tourists would be pushy when the park is crowded. At the entry, they let us through with water bottles and snacks, although maybe they were lenient because of the rain. The food is expensive, and the $22 hkd coffee ($2.83 us) was somewhere between 6 and 8 oz. size. Ok, maybe I'm slightly exaggerating, but that would still make it more expensive per oz. than a Starbucks mocha! And it was a weak, watery version. The hot chocolate was much better, although the same price and size. The turkey leg was much smaller than the CA Disney one, but still quite tasty. I think that was $50 hkd ($6.44 us), and the corn was also in the $20  hkd range. My kids liked that a lot. The cuttlefish balls were double the street price ($15 vs $7 hkd), but still a better deal than the coffee. If it hadn't been rainy and cold, I would've never gotten the coffee. The french fries were the best! Piping hot out of the fryer, crispy outside, tender soft on the inside, fantastic on a wet, cold day. By the way, the adult rain poncho was about $55 hkd, vs $20  hkd at a drugstore. This one, I'll have to say, was marginally better, since it was made of thicker plastic, had snaps on the sides, and has a cute Disney logo on the back. It can definitely be reused. The rain had unexpected benefits. Everyone was slower, the park was much emptier, and we were all in the same wet boat, so there was a general air of camaraderie. The only lines we ever waited in were for the jungle cruise (20 min) and autopia(20 min). Everything else was 5 min or less. We did see the winnie the pooh ride with a long line, so we just got fast passes, and when we returned in the evening, there was no line anyway. Oh, and the one time we used the passes, it was like US Disney, we went after the stated time range, and the CM waved us through. We did Buzz Lightyear 10 times in a row, no wait at all. My husband did space mountain 3 times. Jungle cruise twice, once in Mandarin, once in English, just to see, and also because it was different from the 2 in the states, and the big fire actually warmed me up a little. The rain really allowed us to do all the rides we wanted, as many times as we wanted, with almost no wait. We figured out that Philharmonic is best seen from the back, so the second time, we sat further back. We were the last ones in, but since it wasn't crowded, everyone entering from the left would move right, and stop in the middle of the long row of seats. We just went to the back, looped all the way right, and moved backwards left, and got great seats almost at the middle. We were also the first ones out. Rain has huge benefits for the people interested in the rides.This is definitely a new park. The jungle cruise animals are brighter, cleaner, and everything generally looks newer. The autopia cars are electric, or something like that. No more horrible fumes   they make a cool series of noises when you step on the 'gas'. The thunder mountain roller coaster equivalent was fantastic! It's as though they merged it with the Yeti one at Animal Kingdom, and came up with this. Excellent fun! The surrounding water play areas was also very well done. Toy story was also nicely detailed, even if the rides were mostly for little kids. Many people posing for pix, even in the rain. The Stitch show was worth going to   a reviewer said it was in Cantonese, but our show was all in English. Quite entertaining! No parade, due to the rain, but luckily the fireworks were still on. Maybe because of the overcast fog, they weren't as impressive (nothing like the Wishes one, my all time favorite), but still entertaining. Leaving the park at the end was also completely hassle free. We easily got seats on the Disney MTR car, and it almost seemed that most people left via the parking lot vs the MTR. It was not crowded at all, only when we hit the red line did it become standing room only.HK Disney did a god job of handling the rain, with mats to soak up water, mopping when needed, and many many plastic umbrella bags. The CMs are not as 'smiley smiley', but I tend to think that's a Chinese thing in general. I wonder if Tokyo Disney is the same. I would not want to go on a sunny weekend unless I had no choice, but a rainy Thursday, why not? Park was open from 10:30 8, we were there for 9 hours, and definitely packed in our money's worth, especially with discount tix from CTS hong kong at about 15% off. Excellent rainy day at Disney!",1
Everything was wonderful about our visit but some notes for next time. Bring battery back up for my phone Disneyland needs a 3 day pass California is good for a 2 day pass Avoid gift shops Get celebration button at gift shop Map out what shows to see use only 1 photo pass per family,1
"Its Disney! Very hard to do in one day but we hit all the highlights   weekday visit last week of July   crowd meter at 9 out of 10 but really the only wait was at Space Mountain (50 minutes) and Splash Mountain (posted 110 minutes, we left the line after 20). My five year olds liked the 'little kids' rides more than I expected them to   Toon Town and FantasyLand. ",1
"Definitely smaller than the one in Paris, the Hong Kong Disneyland also offers what the other Disneyland parks offers to its guests. Rides, shows, meet and greet session with Disney characters, a parade of Disney stars, and an impressive fire works display to cap off the day just to name a few. Just like the Hong Kong Ocean Park, I personally wish that the shows were done in English rather than Cantonese. Visitors of this place should prepare for long queues so if its a sunny day make sure that you also bring an umbrella with you aside from wearing comfortable shoes. It can also get quite hot in Hong Kong so also bring along extra water with you.",1
"Even thought the Ticket was so expensive for one person ,, I wished if they add more fun games that suits all people ,, overall it was much fun walking around and it was a different experience, for me .. love it .. advice you to visit ^^",1
"We had a great day at Disneyland. I have read reviews where people class this as small. We did not see it all in a day   by the time you queue up for a photos and rides   we definitely could have spent another day here. And that moment, when your see the fireworks   it is indescribable   a dream come true!",1
"We just got home from our first trip to Disneyland and I had heard all the horror stories of lines and people. They do have those, but we covered the whole park in a day. We had a 3 day park hopper pass and did Disney the first day, California Adventure the second day. By the third day, we did half a day in Disney and half a day at California Adventure, and we just repeated the rides we enjoyed the most. Get the fast pass for the busier rides and then go do one or two others in the areas your fast pass ride is in. You can wipe out the park in a day that way. We did every ride there besides the kiddie type rides and we even did a few of those. Matterhorn is fun, hyperspace mountain, Indiana Jones, Pirates of the Caribean and Splash mountain were our favorites. Disneyland seems very compact, but one thing I can say is they can move those lines. They have the best crowd control and as someone is getting off the ride, your getting on. It flows nicely. We did not take kids thankfully because a lot of people with little kids and strollers were not having as much fun. Kids get bored standing in line. We had the Disneyland APP which gives you a layout of the park and wait times. Some of the times would say 45 min wait and we waited no more than 20 min. So use it as a guide, since the times are a bit inaccurate. You can take in water and some food in a backpack which we did. They easily can go on all the rides. Glad we went and if we did it again, it would definitely be in the off season again.",1
Loved loved loved Disneyland Park. Fulfilled a lifelong dream of going to Disneyland. It is everything i ever imagined it would be!,1
